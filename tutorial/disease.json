{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Acne", "introduction": "Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch. \n Acne most commonly develops on the: \n \n face \u2013 this affects almost everyone with acne \n back \u2013 this affects\u00a0more than\u00a0half of people with acne \n chest \u2013 this affects\u00a0about 15% of\u00a0people with acne \n \n Types of spots \n There are 6\u00a0main types of spot caused by acne: \n \n blackheads \u2013\u00a0small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin;\u00a0they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces pigmentation (colouring) \n whiteheads \u2013 have a similar appearance to blackheads, but\u00a0may be firmer and won't empty when squeezed \n papules \u2013\u00a0small red bumps that may feel tender or sore \n pustules \u2013\u00a0similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus \n nodules \u2013\u00a0large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be\u00a0painful \n cysts \u2013\u00a0the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils\u00a0and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring \n \n What can I do if I have acne? \n The self-help techniques below may be useful: \n \n Don't wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day. Frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse \n Wash the affected area with\u00a0a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse \n Don't try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots.\u00a0This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring \n Avoid using too much make-up and cosmetics. Use water-based products that are described as non-comedogenic (this means the product is less likely to block the pores in your skin) \n Completely remove make-up before going to bed \n If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free, water-based emollient \n Regular exercise can't improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem.\u00a0Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising, as sweat can irritate your acne \n Wash your hair regularly\u00a0and try to avoid letting\u00a0your hair fall across your face \n \n Although acne can't be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels\u00a0for treating spots are available at pharmacies. \n If you develop acne, it's a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice. Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended\u00a0\u2013 but be careful, as this can bleach clothing. \n If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back,\u00a0it may need to be treated with\u00a0 antibiotics  or stronger creams that are only\u00a0available on prescription. \n When to seek medical advice \n Even mild cases of acne can cause distress. If your acne is making you feel very unhappy or you can't control\u00a0your spots\u00a0with over-the-counter medication,\u00a0see your GP. \n Also see your GP if you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring.\u00a0Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring. \n Treatments can take up to 3\u00a0months to work, so don't expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good. \n Read more about: \n  diagnosing acne  \n  treating acne  \n  complications of acne  \n Why do I have acne? \n Acne is most commonly\u00a0linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. \n Certain hormones cause\u00a0the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). \n This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. \n The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores (opening of the hair follicles). Cleaning the skin doesn't help to remove this blockage. \n Other possible causes \n Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne. \n Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women. \n There's no evidence that diet, poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of acne ,\u00a0including some common acne myths. \n Who's affected? \n Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11\u00a0to 30\u00a0are affected by acne. \n Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14\u00a0to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16\u00a0to 19. \n Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties. \n In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About\u00a05% of\u00a0women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Acne is caused when tiny holes in the skin, known as hair follicles, become blocked. \n Sebaceous glands are tiny glands found near the surface of your skin. The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of. \n Sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum. \n In acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle. \n If the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead. \n Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts. \n Testosterone\u00a0 \n Teenage acne\u00a0is thought to be triggered by increased levels of a hormone called testosterone, which occurs during puberty. The hormone plays an important role in stimulating the growth and development of the penis and testicles in boys, and maintaining muscle and bone strength in girls. \n The sebaceous glands are particularly sensitive to hormones.\u00a0It's thought that increased levels of\u00a0testosterone cause the glands to produce much more sebum than the skin needs. \n Acne in families \n Acne\u00a0can run in families. If your parents had acne, it's likely that you'll also develop it. \n One study has found that if both your parents had acne, you're more likely to get more severe acne at an early age. It also found that if one or both of your parents had adult acne, you're more likely to get adult acne too. \n Acne in women \n More than\u00a080% of\u00a0cases of adult acne\u00a0occur in women. It's thought that many cases of adult acne are\u00a0caused by\u00a0the changes in hormone levels that many women have at certain times. \n These times\u00a0include: \n \n periods\u00a0\u2013 some women have a flare-up of acne just before their period \n  pregnancy \u00a0\u2013 many women have symptoms of acne at this time, usually during the first 3\u00a0months of their pregnancy \n  polycystic ovary syndrome \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a common condition that can cause acne, weight gain and the formation of small cysts inside the ovary \n \n Other triggers \n Other possible triggers of an acne flare-up include: \n \n some cosmetic products\u00a0\u2013\u00a0however, this is less common as most products are now tested,\u00a0so they don't cause spots\u00a0(non-comedogenic) \n certain medications\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as  steroid medications , lithium\u00a0(used to treat\u00a0 depression  and  bipolar disorder ) and\u00a0some anti-epileptic drugs (used to treat\u00a0 epilepsy ) \n regularly wearing items that place pressure on an affected area of skin, such as\u00a0a headband or backpack \n  smoking \u00a0\u2013 which can contribute to acne in older people \n \n Acne myths \n Despite being one of the most widespread skin conditions, acne is also one of the most poorly understood.\u00a0There are\u00a0many myths and misconceptions about it: \n \"Acne is caused by a poor diet\" \n So far, research hasn't found any foods that cause acne. Eating a healthy, balanced diet is recommended because it's good for your heart and your health in general. \n \"Acne is caused by having dirty skin and poor hygiene\" \n Most of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath the skin, not on the surface, so\u00a0the cleanliness of your skin\u00a0has\u00a0no effect on your acne. Washing your face more than twice a day could just aggravate your skin. \n \"Squeezing blackheads, whiteheads and spots is the best way to get rid of acne\"\u00a0 \n This could actually make symptoms worse and may leave you with scarring. \n \"Sexual activity can influence acne\" \n Having sex or masturbating won't make acne any better or worse. \n \"Sunbathing, sunbeds and sunlamps help improve the symptoms of acne\" \n There's no conclusive evidence that prolonged exposure to sunlight or using sunbeds or sunlamps can improve acne. Many medications used to treat acne can make your skin more sensitive to light, so exposure could cause painful damage to your skin, and also increase your risk of skin cancer. \n \"Acne is infectious\" \n You can't pass acne on to other people.", "treatment": "Treatment for acne depends on how severe it is. It can take several months of treatment before acne symptoms improve. \n The various treatments for acne are outlined below. \n If you just have a few blackheads, whiteheads and spots, you should be able to treat them successfully with over-the-counter gels or creams (topical treatments) that contain benzoyl peroxide. \n Treatments from your GP \n See your GP if your acne is more widespread,\u00a0as you probably need prescription medication.\u00a0For example, if: \n \n you have a large number of papules and pustules \n over-the-counter medication hasn't worked \n \n Prescription medications that can be used to treat acne include: \n \n topical retinoids \n topical\u00a0 antibiotics  \n azelaic acid \n antibiotic tablets \n in women, the  combined oral contraceptive pill  \n isotretinoin tablets \n \n If you have severe acne,\u00a0your GP can refer you to an expert in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). For example, if you have: \n \n a large number of papules and pustules on your chest and back, as well as your face \n painful nodules \n \n A combination of\u00a0antibiotic tablets and topical treatments is usually the first treatment option for severe acne. If this doesn't work, a medication called\u00a0isotretinoin may be prescribed. \n Hormonal therapies or the combined oral contraceptive pill can also be effective in women who have acne. However, the\u00a0 progestogen-only pill  or\u00a0 contraceptive implant  can sometimes make acne worse. \n Many of these treatments can take 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0months before they start to work. It's important to be patient and persist with a recommended treatment, even if\u00a0there's no immediate effect. \n Topical treatments (gels, creams and lotions) \n Benzoyl peroxide \n Benzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It also helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect. \n Benzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It's used either once or twice a day. It should be applied 20 minutes after washing to all of the parts of your face affected by acne. \n It should be used sparingly, as too much can irritate your skin. It also makes your face more sensitive to sunlight, so avoid too much sun and ultraviolet (UV) light, or wear sun cream. \n Benzoyl peroxide can have a bleaching effect, so avoid getting it on your hair or\u00a0clothes. \n Common side effects of benzoyl peroxide include: \n \n dry and tense skin \n a burning, itching or stinging sensation \n some redness and peeling of the skin \n \n Side effects are usually mild and should pass once the treatment has finished. \n Most people need a 6 week course of treatment to clear most or all of their acne. You may be advised to continue treatment less frequently to prevent acne returning. \n Topical retinoids \n Topical retinoids work by\u00a0removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin (exfoliating)\u00a0which helps\u00a0to prevent them building up within hair follicles. \n Tretinoin and adapalene are topical retinoids used to treat acne. They're available in a gel or cream and are usually applied once a day before you go to bed. \n Apply to all the parts of your face affected by acne 20 minutes after washing your face. \n It's important to apply topical retinoids sparingly and avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and UV. \n Topical retinoids aren't suitable for use during pregnancy, as there's a risk they might cause birth defects. \n The most common side effects of topical retinoids are mild irritation and stinging of the skin. \n A 6 week course is usually required, but you may be advised to continue using the medication less frequently after this. \n Topical antibiotics \n Topical antibiotics help kill the bacteria on the skin that can infect plugged hair follicles. They're available as a lotion or gel that is applied once or twice a day. \n A 6 to 8\u00a0week course is usually recommended. After this, treatment is usually stopped, as there's a risk that the bacteria on your face could become resistant to the antibiotics. This could make your acne worse and cause additional infections. \n Side effects are uncommon, but can include: \n \n minor irritation of the skin \n redness and burning of the skin \n peeling of the skin \n \n Azelaic acid \n Azelaic acid is often used as an alternative treatment for acne if the side effects of benzoyl peroxide or topical retinoids are particularly irritating or painful. \n Azelaic acid works by getting rid of dead skin and killing bacteria. It's available\u00a0as a\u00a0cream or gel and is usually applied twice a day (or once a day if your skin is particularly sensitive). \n The medication doesn't make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so you don't have to avoid exposure to the sun. \n You'll usually need to use azelaic acid for a month before your acne improves. \n The side effects of azelaic acid are usually mild and include: \n \n burning or stinging skin \n itchiness \n dry skin \n redness of the skin \n \n Antibiotic tablets \n Antibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics) are usually used in combination with a topical treatment to treat more severe acne. \n In most cases, a class of antibiotics called tetracyclines is prescribed, unless you're pregnant or breastfeeding. \n Pregnant or breastfeeding women are usually advised to take an antibiotic called erythromycin, which is known to be safer to use. \n It usually takes about 6\u00a0weeks before you notice an improvement in your acne. \n Depending on how well you react to the treatment, a course of oral antibiotics can last 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0months. \n Tetracyclines can make your skin sensitive to sunlight and UV light, and can also make the oral contraceptive pill less effective during the first few weeks of treatment. \n You'll need to use an alternative method of contraception, such as  condoms , during this time. \n Hormonal therapies \n Hormonal therapies can often benefit women with acne, especially if the acne flares up around\u00a0periods or\u00a0is associated with hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome. \n If you don't already use it, your GP may recommend the  combined oral contraceptive pill , even if you're not sexually active. This combined pill can often help improve acne in women, but may take up to a year before the full benefits are seen. \n Co-cyprindiol \n Co-cyprindiol is a hormonal treatment that can be used for more severe acne\u00a0that doesn't respond to antibiotics. It helps to reduce the production of sebum. \n You'll probably have to use co-cyprindiol for 2\u00a0to 6\u00a0months before you notice a significant improvement in your acne. \n There's a small risk\u00a0that women taking co-cyprindiol may develop  breast cancer  in later life. \n For example, out of a group of 10,000 women who haven't taken co-cyprindiol, you would expect 16 of them to develop breast cancer by the time they were 35. This figure rises to 17 or 18 for women who were treated with co-cyprindiol for at least 5\u00a0years in their early twenties. \n There's also a very small chance of co-cyprindiol causing a blood clot. The risk\u00a0is\u00a0estimated to\u00a0be around 1 in 2,500 in any given year. \n It's not thought to be safe to take co-cyprindiol if you're pregnant or breastfeeding.\u00a0Women may need to have a pregnancy test before treatment can begin. \n Other side effects of co-cyprindiol include: \n \n bleeding and spotting between your periods, which\u00a0can sometimes occur for the first few months \n headaches \n sore breasts \n mood changes \n loss of interest in sex \n weight gain or weight loss \n \n Isotretinoin \n Isotretinoin\u00a0has a number of beneficial effects: \n \n it helps to normalise sebum and reduce how much is\u00a0produced \n it helps to prevent follicles becoming clogged \n it decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin \n it reduces redness and swelling in and around spots \n \n However,\u00a0the drug\u00a0can also cause a wide range of side effects. It's only recommended for severe cases of acne that haven't responded to other treatments. \n Because of the risk of side effects, isotretinoin can only be prescribed by a specially trained GP or a\u00a0dermatologist. \n Isotretinoin is taken\u00a0as a\u00a0tablet. Most people take a 4\u00a0to 6 month course. Your acne may get worse during the first 7 to 10 days of treatment. However, this is normal and soon settles. \n Common side effects of isotretinoin include: \n \n inflammation, dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils \n changes in your blood sugar levels \n inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) \n  inflammation and irritation of your eyes (conjunctivitis)  \n blood in your urine \n \n Rarer side effects of isotretinoin include: \n \n  inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)  \n  inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)  \n  kidney disease  \n \n Because of the risk of these rarer side effects, you'll need a\u00a0 blood test  before and during treatment. \n Isotretinoin and birth defects \n Isotretinoin will damage an unborn baby. If you're a woman of childbearing age: \n \n don't use isotretinoin if you're\u00a0pregnant or you think you're pregnant \n use 1, or ideally 2, methods of contraception for 1\u00a0month before treatment begins, during treatment and for 1\u00a0month after treatment has finished \n have a pregnancy test before, during and after treatment \n \n You'll be asked to sign a form confirming that you understand the risk of birth defects and are willing to use contraceptives to prevent this risk, even if you're not currently sexually active. \n If you think you may\u00a0have become pregnant when taking isotretinoin, contact your dermatologist immediately. \n Isotretinoin is also not suitable if you're breastfeeding. \n Isotretinoin and mood changes \n There have been reports of people experiencing mood changes while taking isotretinoin. There's no evidence that these mood changes were the result of the medication. \n However, as a precaution, contact your doctor immediately if you feel depressed or anxious, have feelings of aggression or suicidal thoughts. \n Non-pharmaceutical treatments \n Several treatments for acne don't involve medication. \n These include: \n \n comedone extractor \u2013 a small pen-shaped instrument that can be used to clean out blackheads and whiteheads \n chemical peels \u2013 where a chemical solution is applied to the face, causing the skin to peel off and new skin to replace it \n photodynamic therapy \u2013 where light is applied to the skin in an attempt to improve symptoms of acne \n \n However, these treatments may not work and can't be routinely recommended.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. This involves examining your face, chest and back for the different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules. \n How many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. This is\u00a0important in planning your treatment. \n 4\u00a0grades can be used to measure the severity of acne: \n \n grade 1 (mild) \u2013 acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules \n grade 2 (moderate) \u2013 there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face \n grade 3 (moderately severe) \u2013 there's a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne \n grade 4 (severe) \u2013 there's a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules \n \n Acne in women \n If acne suddenly starts\u00a0in adult women, it\u00a0can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms such as: \n \n excessive body hair (hirsutism) \n irregular or light periods \n \n The most common cause of hormonal imbalances in women is\u00a0polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS can be diagnosed using a combination of\u00a0 ultrasound scans  and  blood tests . \n Read more about diagnosing PCOS."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bronchiectasis", "introduction": "Bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. \n The most common symptoms of bronchiectasis include: \n \n a persistent\u00a0 cough  that usually brings up phlegm (sputum) \n breathlessness \n \n The severity of symptoms can vary widely. Some people have only a few symptoms that don't appear often, while others have wide-ranging daily\u00a0symptoms. \n The symptoms tend to get worse if you develop an infection in your lungs. \n Read more about the  symptoms of bronchiectasis . \n When to see your GP \n You should see your GP if you develop a persistent cough. While this may not be\u00a0caused by\u00a0bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation. \n If your GP suspects you may have bronchiectasis, they'll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further tests. \n Read more about  diagnosing bronchiectasis . \n How the lungs are affected \n The lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream. \n The inside walls of the bronchi are coated with sticky mucus, which protects against damage from particles moving down into the lungs. \n In bronchiectasis, one or more of the bronchi are abnormally widened. This means more mucus than usual gathers there, which makes the bronchi more vulnerable to infection. If an infection does develop, the bronchi may be damaged again, so even more mucus gathers in them, and the risk of infection increases further. \n Over time, this cycle can cause gradually worsening damage to the lungs. \n Why it happens \n Bronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed.\u00a0 \n There are many reasons why this may happen. The three most common causes in the UK\u00a0are: \n \n a\u00a0lung infection during childhood, such as  pneumonia  or  whooping cough , that damages the bronchi \n underlying problems with the immune system (the body\u2019s defence against infection) that make the bronchi more vulnerable to damage from an infection \n allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) \u2013 an allergy to a certain type of fungi that can cause the bronchi to become inflamed if spores from the fungi\u00a0are inhaled \n \n However, in many cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause for the condition can be found (known as idiopathic bronchiectasis). \n Read more about the  causes of bronchiectasis . \n Who is affected \n Bronchiectasis is thought to be uncommon. It's estimated that around 1 in every 1,000 adults in the UK have the condition. \n It can affect anyone at any age, but\u00a0symptoms don't usually develop until middle age. \n Over 12,000\u00a0people\u00a0were admitted\u00a0to hospital in England during 2013-14 with bronchiectasis. The majority of these\u00a0people were over 60 years old. \n How bronchiectasis is treated \n The damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help relieve your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse. \n The main treatments include: \n \n exercises and special devices\u00a0to help you clear mucus out of your\u00a0lungs \n medication to help improve airflow within the lungs \n  antibiotics  to treat any lung infections that develop \n \n Surgery\u00a0is usually only considered for bronchiectasis in rare cases where other treatments haven't been effective, the damage to your bronchi is confined to a small area and you're in good general health. \n Read more about the  treatment of bronchiectasis . \n Possible complications \n Complications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious. One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused\u00a0by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting. This problem can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it. \n Read more about the  complications of bronchiectasis . \n Outlook \n The outlook for people with bronchiectasis is highly variable and often depends on the underlying cause. \n Living with bronchiectasis can be stressful and frustrating, but most people with the condition have a normal life expectancy. For people with very severe symptoms, however, bronchiectasis can be fatal if the lungs stop working properly. \n Around 1,000 deaths reported in England and Wales each year are thought to be\u00a0caused by\u00a0bronchiectasis. \n Information about you \n If you have\u00a0bronchiectasis, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register .", "symptoms": "The most common symptom of bronchiectasis is a persistent cough that brings up a large amount of phlegm on a daily basis. \n The phlegm\u00a0can be clear, pale yellow or yellow-greenish in colour. Other people\u00a0may only occasionally\u00a0cough up small amounts of phlegm, or none at all. \n Other symptoms may include: \n \n shortness of breath \n wheezing \n coughing up blood or blood-stained phlegm \n chest pain \n joint pain \n clubbing of the fingertips \u2013 the tissue beneath the nail thickens and the fingertips become rounded and bulbous \n \n Signs of a lung infection \n If you\u00a0develop a lung infection, your symptoms usually get worse\u00a0within a few days. This is known as an infective exacerbation and it can cause: \n \n coughing up even more\u00a0phlegm, which may be\u00a0more green than usual\u00a0or smell unpleasant \n worsening shortness of breath \n \n You may also: \n \n feel very tired \n cough up blood, if you haven't already done so \n experience a sharp chest pain that's made worse when breathing ( pleurisy ) \n feel generally unwell \n \n When to seek medical advice \n If you haven't previously been\u00a0diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you develop a persistent cough, visit your GP for advice. \n While persistent coughing may not necessarily be the result of bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation. \n If you've been previously diagnosed with bronchiectasis and you begin to experience symptoms that suggest you have a lung infection, contact your GP. You'll usually need treatment with antibiotics. \n Some people with bronchiectasis are given a stock of antibiotics as a precaution, in case they suddenly develop a lung infection. \n When to seek immediate medical advice \n Some people with bronchiectasis develop a severe lung infection that may need to be treated in hospital. \n Signs and symptoms of serious lung infection include: \n \n a bluish tinge to the\u00a0skin and lips (cyanosis) \n confusion \n a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above \n rapid breathing (more than 25 breaths\u00a0a minute) \n severe chest pain that makes it too painful to cough and clear your lungs \n \n If you experience any of the above, phone the healthcare professional in charge of your care immediately. This may be your GP, a doctor who specialises in lung conditions (pulmonologist) or a specialist nurse. \n If this isn't possible, then phone the NHS 24 111 service\u00a0or your local out-of-hours service.", "causes": "Bronchiectasis is caused by the airways of the lungs becoming damaged and widened. This can be due to an infection or another condition. Sometimes, the cause is not known. \n Your lungs are continually exposed to germs, so\u00a0your body has sophisticated defence mechanisms designed to keep the lungs free of infection. \n If\u00a0a foreign substance (such as bacteria or a virus) gets past these defences, your immune system will attempt to stop the spread of any infection by sending white blood cells to the location of the infection. These cells release chemicals to fight the infection, which can cause the\u00a0surrounding tissue to become inflamed. \n For most people, this inflammation will pass without causing any further problems. However, bronchiectasis can occur if the inflammation permanently destroys the elastic-like tissue and muscles surrounding the bronchi (airways), causing them to widen. \n The abnormal bronchi then become filled with excess mucus, which can trigger persistent coughing and make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. If the lungs do become infected again, this\u00a0can result in further inflammation and further widening of the bronchi. \n As this cycle is repeated, the damage to the lungs gets progressively worse. How quickly bronchiectasis progresses can vary significantly. For some people, the condition will get worse quickly, but for many the progression is slow. \n Common\u00a0causes \n In around half of all cases of bronchiectasis, no obvious cause can be found.\u00a0 \n Some of the more\u00a0common triggers that have been identified are described below. \n Childhood infections \n Around a third of cases of bronchiectasis in adults are associated with a severe lung infection in childhood, such as: \n \n severe  pneumonia  \n  whooping cough \u00a0 \n  tuberculosis (TB) \u00a0 \n  measles  \n \n However, as there are now vaccinations available for these infections, it is expected that childhood infections will become a less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future. \n Immunodeficiency \n Around 1 in 12 cases of bronchiectasis occur because a person has a weakened immune system, which makes their lungs more vulnerable to tissue damage. The medical term for having a weakened immune system is immunodeficiency. \n Some people are born with an immunodeficiency because of problems with the genes they inherit from their parents. It's also possible to acquire an immunodeficiency\u00a0after an infection such as  HIV . \n Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) \n Around 1 in 14 people with bronchiectasis develop the condition as a complication of an allergic condition known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). \n People with ABPA have an allergy to a type of fungi known as aspergillus, which is found in a wide range of different environments across the world. \n If a person with ABPA breathes in fungal spores, it can trigger an allergic reaction and persistent inflammation, which in turn can progress to bronchiectasis.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Aspiration \n Aspiration is the medical term for stomach contents accidentally passing into your lungs, rather than down into your gastrointestinal tract. This is responsible for around 1 in 25 cases of bronchiectasis. \n The lungs are very sensitive to the presence of foreign objects, such as small samples of food or even stomach acids, so this can trigger inflammation leading to bronchiectasis. \n Cystic fibrosis \n  Cystic fibrosis  is a relatively common genetic disorder, where the lungs become clogged up with mucus. The mucus then provides an ideal environment for a bacterial infection to take place, leading to the symptoms of bronchiectasis. \n It is estimated that cystic fibrosis is responsible for around 1 in 33 cases of bronchiectasis. \n Cilia abnormalities \n Cilia are the tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways in the lungs. They are designed to protect the airways and help move away any excess mucus. Bronchiectasis can develop if there is a problem with the cilia that means they are unable to effectively clear mucus from the airways. \n Conditions that can cause problems with the cilia include: \n \n Young's disease \u2013 a rare condition only affecting males that is thought to be caused by exposure to mercury in childhood \n primary ciliary dyskinesia \u2013 a rare condition caused by inheriting faulty genes \n \n It's estimated that about 1 in every 33 cases of bronchiectasis are caused by Young's disease and 1 or 2 in every 100 cases are caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia. \n However, as the regulations regarding the use of mercury are now much stricter than they were in the past, it is expected that Young\u2019s syndrome will become a much less common cause of bronchiectasis in the future.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Connective tissue diseases \n Certain conditions that cause inflammation in other areas of the body are sometimes associated with bronchiectasis, including: \n \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \n  Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome  \n  Crohn's disease \u00a0 \n  ulcerative colitis  \n \n These conditions are usually thought to be caused by a problem with the immune system, where it mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.", "treatment": "The damage to the lungs associated with bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help prevent the condition getting worse. \n In most cases, treatment involves a combination of medication, exercises you can learn and devices to help clear your airways. Surgery for bronchiectasis is rare. \n There are a number of things you can do to help relieve the symptoms of bronchiectasis and stop the condition getting worse, including: \n \n  stopping smoking  (if you smoke) \n having the flu vaccine every year \n making sure you have had the  pneumococcal vaccine  to protect against  pneumonia  \n  exercising  regularly \n keeping yourself well hydrated \n eating a  balanced diet  \n \n Exercises \n There are a range of exercises, known as airway clearance techniques, which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. This can often help improve coughing and breathlessness in people with bronchiectasis. \n You can be referred to a\u00a0physiotherpist, who can teach you these techniques. \n Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) \n The most widely used technique in the UK is called active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT). \n ACBT involves you repeating a cycle made up of a number of different steps. These include a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up; then you cough the mucus out. The cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes. \n Don't attempt ACBT if you haven't first been taught the steps by a suitably trained physiotherapist, as performing the techniques incorrectly could damage your lungs. \n If you're otherwise in good health, you'll probably only need to perform ACBT once or twice a day. If you develop a lung infection, you may need to perform ACBT on a more frequent basis. \n Postural drainage \n Changing your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. This is known as postural drainage. \n Each technique can involve several complex steps, but most techniques involve you leaning or lying down while the physiotherapist or a carer uses their hands to vibrate certain sections of your lungs as you go through a series of \"huffing\" and coughing. \n Devices \n There are also a number of handheld devices that can help to remove mucus from your lungs. \n Although these devices look different, most work in a similar way. Generally, they use a combination of vibrations and air pressure to make it easier to cough out any mucus. \n Examples of these devices\u00a0include the flutter, the RC cornet and the Acapella. \n However, these devices aren't always available on the NHS, so you may have to pay for one yourself. They usually cost \u00a345 to \u00a360. \n Medication \n In some cases, medications to make breathing or clearing your lungs easier may be prescribed. These are discussed below. \n Nebulised medications \n Occasionally, medication inhaled through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended to help make it easier for you to clear your lungs. \n Nebulisers are devices consisting of a face mask or mouthpiece, a chamber to convert the medication into a fine mist, and a compressor to pump the medication into your lungs. \n A number of different medications can be administered using a nebuliser, including salt water solutions. These medications help to reduce the thickness of your phlegm so it's easier to cough it out. Nebulisers can also be used to administer antibiotics, if necessary (see below). \n However, while the medications used with a nebuliser can be provided on prescription, the nebuliser device itself isn't always available on the NHS. In some areas, a local respiratory service may provide the device without charge, but if this isn't an option, you may have to pay for a device. \n Bronchodilators \n If you have a particularly severe flare-up of symptoms, you may be prescribed bronchodilator medications on a short-term basis. \n Bronchodilators are inhaled medications that help make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs. Examples of this type of medication include beta2-adrenergic agonist, anticholinergics and theophylline. \n Antibiotics \n If you experience a worsening of symptoms because of a bacterial infection (known as an \"infective exacerbation\") then you'll need to be treated with  antibiotics . \n A sample of phlegm will be taken to determine what type of bacteria is causing the infection, although you'll be initially treated with an antibiotic known to be effective against a number of different bacteria (a broad spectrum antibiotic) because\u00a0it can take a few days to get the test results. \n Depending on the test results, you may be prescribed a different antibiotic, or in some cases, a combination of antibiotics known to be effective against the specific bacteria causing the infection. \n If you're well enough to be treated at home, you'll probably be prescribed two to three antibiotic tablets a day for 10-14 days. It's important to finish the course even if you feel better, as stopping the course prematurely could cause the infection to recur quickly. \n If your symptoms are more severe (see\u00a0 symptoms of bronchiectasis  for a detailed description) you may need to be admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotic injections. \n Preventative treatment \n If you have three or more infective exacerbations in any one year, or your symptoms during an infective exacerbation were particularly severe, it may be recommended that you take antibiotics on a long-term basis. This can help to prevent further infections and give your lungs the chance to recover. \n This could involve taking low-dose antibiotic tablets to minimise the risk of side effects, or using an antibiotic nebuliser (see above for more information about nebulisers). \n Using antibiotics in this way does increase the risk that one or more types of bacteria will develop a resistance to the antibiotic. Therefore, you may be asked to give regular phlegm samples to check for any resistance. If bacteria do show signs of developing a resistance, then your antibiotic may need to be changed. \n Surgery \n Surgery is usually only recommended where bronchiectasis is only affecting a single section of your lung, your symptoms aren't responding to other treatment and you don't have an underlying condition that could cause bronchiectasis to recur. \n The lungs are made up of sections known as lobes \u2013 the left lung has two lobes and the right lung has three lobes. Surgery for focal bronchiectasis would usually involve removing the lobe affected by the bronchiectasis in a type of operation known as a lobectomy. \n Surgery won't be used if more than one lobe is affected, as it\u2019s too dangerous to remove so much lung tissue.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "You should see your GP for advice if you develop a persistent cough, so they can look for a possible cause. \n Your GP will ask you about your symptoms, such as how often you cough, whether you bring up any phlegm (sputum) and whether you smoke. \n They may also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out. The lungs of people with bronchiectasis often make a distinctive crackling noise as a person breaths in and out. \n You'll also probably\u00a0have a chest\u00a0 X-ray  to rule out other, more serious, causes of your symptoms, such as  lung cancer . \n If your GP thinks you may have a lung infection, they may take a sample of your phlegm, so it can be checked for bacteria. \n Referral to a specialist \n If your GP suspects you could have bronchiectasis, you'll be referred to a doctor who specialises in treating lung conditions (a respiratory consultant) for further testing. \n The maximum time you should have to wait for referral is 18 weeks, although you may not have to wait as long as this. Read more about waiting times. \n Some of the tests a respiratory consultant may carry out to help diagnose bronchiectasis are described below. \n HRCT scan \n Currently, the most effective test available to diagnose bronchiectasis is called a high-resolution  computerised tomography  (HRCT) scan. \n A HRCT scan involves taking several X-rays of your chest at slightly different angles.\u00a0A computer is then used to put all the images together. This produces a very detailed picture of the inside of your body and the airways inside your lungs (the bronchi) should show up very clearly. \n In a healthy pair of lungs, the bronchi should become narrower the further they spread into your lungs, in the same way a tree branch separates into narrower branches and twigs. \n If the scan shows that a section of airways is actually getting wider, this usually confirms bronchiectasis. \n Other tests \n Other tests can be used to assess the state of your lungs and to try to determine what the underlying cause of your bronchiectasis may be. \n These tests may include: \n \n  blood tests  \u2013 to check how well your immune system is working and check for infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi \n phlegm (sputum) test\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to check for bacteria or fungi \n a sample of your sweat can be tested to see how much salt is in it \u2013 high levels of salt can be caused by cystic fibrosis (if this test is positive, then a more detailed genetic test can be carried out; see  diagnosing cystic fibrosis  for more information) \n lung\u00a0function test \u2013 a small, hand-held device (spirometer) that you blow into is used to measure how hard and how quickly you can expel air from your lungs; this can assess how well your lungs are working \n bronchoscopy \u2013 a flexible tube with a camera at one end is used to look into your lungs; this is usually only required if you think you've\u00a0inhaled\u00a0a foreign object"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bunion", "introduction": "A bunion is a bony deformity of the joint at the base of the big toe. The medical name is hallux valgus. \n The main sign of a bunion is the big toe pointing towards the other toes on the same foot, which may force the foot bone\u00a0attached to\u00a0it (the first metatarsal) to stick outwards. \n Other symptoms may include: \n \n a swollen, bony bump on the outside edge of your foot \n pain and swelling over your big toe joint that's made worse by pressure from wearing shoes \n hard, callused and red skin caused by your big toe and second toe overlapping \n sore skin over the top of the bunion \n changes to the shape of your foot, making it difficult to find shoes that fit \n \n These symptoms can sometimes get worse if the bunion is left untreated, so it's best to see a GP. They'll ask you about your symptoms and examine your foot. In some cases, an\u00a0 X-ray  may be recommended to assess the severity of your bunion. \n Anyone can develop a bunion, but they're more common in women than men. This may be because of the style of footwear that women wear. \n What causes bunions? \n The exact cause of\u00a0bunions is unknown, but they tend to run in families.\u00a0Wearing badly fitting shoes is thought to make bunions worse. \n It's also\u00a0thought that bunions are more likely to occur in people with unusually flexible joints, which is why bunions sometimes occur in children. \n In some cases, certain health conditions, such as  rheumatoid arthritis  and  gout , may also be responsible. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of bunions . \n Treating bunions \n There are a number of treatment options\u00a0for bunions. Non-surgical treatments are usually tried first, including painkillers, orthotics (insoles) and bunion pads. \n However, these can only help to reduce the symptoms of bunions, such as pain. They don't improve the appearance of your foot. \n Surgery may be considered if your symptoms are severe and don't respond to non-surgical treatments. The type of surgery will depend on the level of deformity, the severity of your symptoms, your age, and any other associated medical conditions. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating bunions .\u00a0 \n Complications \n If bunions aren't treated,\u00a0they can lead to\u00a0further problems. For example, they can cause arthritis in\u00a0your big toe and push\u00a0your second toe out of place. \n Problems\u00a0can also develop after bunion surgery. While surgery is usually effective (symptoms are improved in 85% of cases), bunions can sometimes return. \n In less than 10% of cases, complications occur after bunion surgery. These will depend on the type of surgery you have and can include: \n \n stiffness in your toe joints \n a delay or failure of the bone to heal, or the bone healing in the wrong position \n pain under the ball of your foot \n damage to the nerves in your foot \n prolonged swelling and continued pain \n the need for further surgery \n \n Read more about the  complications of bunions . \n Preventing bunions \n The best way to reduce your chances of developing bunions is to wear shoes that fit properly. Shoes that are too tight or have high heels can force your toes together.\u00a0Bunions are rare in populations that don\u2019t wear shoes. \n Make sure your shoes are the correct size and that there's enough room to move your toes freely.\u00a0It's best to avoid wearing shoes with high heels or pointy toes.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "A bunion is the result of a deformity in the joint of your big toe. The\u00a0exact cause isn't clear. \n However, possible causes may include: \n \n genetics\u00a0(family history) \n arthritis\u00a0 \n other conditions and syndromes \u2013 such as cerebral palsy\u00a0and\u00a0Marfan syndrome \n poorly fitting shoes\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n These are discussed below. \n Genetics \n If other members of your family have bunions, your risk of developing them is increased. However, this doesn't mean\u00a0you'll definitely develop bunions. \n Arthritis \n The types of arthritis thought to cause bunions are: \n \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \u2013 inflammation and pain in the joints because of the immune system attacking the joint lining \n  gout  \u2013 a type of arthritis that commonly affects the big toe\u00a0 \n psoriatic arthritis \u2013 a type of arthritis associated with the skin condition  psoriasis  \n \n Arthritis in the toe may also develop as a result of a bunion.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  complications of bunions . \n Other conditions \n A number of other conditions are also thought to increase your chances of developing bunions. \n For example, conditions associated with loose ligaments, flexible joints and low muscle tone could increase the likelihood of bunions developing. \n These include neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy, and connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome. \n Poorly fitting shoes \n Poorly fitting shoes can contribute to the development of bunions. Bunions are rare in populations that don't wear shoes. \n Wearing shoes that are too tight and don't fit properly is likely to make an existing bunion worse. \n Shoes that are too tight may rub against your big toe joint. High-heeled shoes that are too tight will squeeze your feet, causing your big toe to remain in a bent position. This can stretch the toe, put pressure on the nerves around it and lead to pain. \n High heels also push most of your body weight forwards onto the front of your foot, which places considerable strain on your toe joints.", "treatment": "A bunion may only need to be treated if it's severe and causing significant pain and discomfort. \n The various treatments for bunions\u00a0are outlined below. \n Non-surgical treatment \n If possible, non-surgical treatment for bunions will be used, which your GP can discuss with you. \n Non-surgical treatments can ease the pain and discomfort caused by a bunion, but they can't change the shape of your foot or prevent a bunion from getting worse over time. \n Non-surgical treatments include: \n \n painkillers \n bunion pads \n orthotics \n wearing suitable footwear \n \n These are discussed in more detail below. \n Painkillers \n If your bunion is painful, over-the-counter\u00a0painkillers such as  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen  may be recommended. \n When using painkillers, always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine and follow the recommended dose. \n Bunion pads \n Bunion pads may also ease the pain of a bunion. Reusable bunion pads, made of either gel or fleece, are available over the counter from pharmacies. \n Some are adhesive and stick over the bunion, while others are held against your foot by a small loop that fits over your big toe. \n Bunion pads stop your foot rubbing on your shoe and relieve the pressure over the enlarged joint at the base of your big toe. \n Orthotics \n Orthotics are placed inside your shoes to help realign the bones of your foot. They\u00a0may help\u00a0relieve the pressure on your bunion, which can ease the pain. However, there's little evidence that orthotics are effective in the long term. \n It's important that the orthotic fits\u00a0properly, so you may want to seek advice from your GP or podiatrist\u00a0(a specialist in diagnosing and treating foot conditions), who can suggest the best ones for you. \n You can buy orthotics over the counter from pharmacies, or they can be custom-made by a podiatrist\u00a0to fit your feet. Whether you need to buy an over-the-counter orthotic or have one specially made will depend on your individual circumstances and the severity of your bunion. \n You can also use special bunion splints,\u00a0worn over the top of your foot and your big toe to help straighten its alignment. Splints are available for both daytime and night-time use. However, there's little evidence that splints are effective. \n Toe spacers are also available, which can help reduce the pain caused by bunions. However, toe spacers or orthotics may be of limited use because they often compete with the bunion for the already limited space in the shoe. \n Ice packs \n If your toe joint is painful and swollen, applying an ice pack to the affected area several times a day can help to relieve the pain and inflammation. \n Never apply ice directly to your skin. Wrap it in a cloth or tea towel. A bag of frozen\u00a0vegetables makes a good ice pack. \u00a0 \n Suitable footwear \n It's recommended that you wear flat or low-heeled, wide-fitting shoes if you have a bunion. Shoes made from soft leather are ideal because they'll relieve any pressure on the bunion.\u00a0 \n Avoid narrow or slip-on shoes. High heels can also make your bunion worse by putting excessive pressure on your toes. \n Surgery \n Surgery is the only way to correct a bunion. A bunion will\u00a0usually get worse over time, so if it's left untreated it's likely to get bigger and become more painful. \n If your bunion is causing a significant amount of pain and affecting your quality of life, your GP may refer you to be assessed for bunion surgery. \n The aim of surgery is to relieve pain and improve the alignment of your big toe. Surgery isn't usually carried out for cosmetic reasons alone. Even after surgery, there may still be limits to the styles of shoe you can wear. \n Bunion surgery is\u00a0often carried out\u00a0as a day procedure, which means you won't have to stay in hospital overnight.\u00a0The procedure will either be carried out under a  local anaesthetic  or a  general anaesthetic . \n Deciding to have surgery \n When deciding whether to have bunion surgery, there are several things to consider including: \n \n your age \u2013 in children, bunion surgery is often delayed\u00a0because of\u00a0the risk of the bunion returning \u00a0 \n your medical history and general health \u2013 problems\u00a0with wound healing and infections are more likely in certain conditions such as  diabetes ; you\u2019re also more likely to develop problems if your bunion is caused by a condition such as  rheumatoid arthritis  \n your occupation and lifestyle \u2013 bunion surgery can make your toes less flexible, and you may be unable to return to the same level of physical activity \n your expectations of surgery \u2013 bunion surgery has about an 85% success rate, but there's no guarantee that your foot will be perfectly straight or pain-free; the success of surgery depends on the type of procedure, the experience of the surgeon and your ability to rest after the operation \n the severity of your symptoms \u2013 surgery will usually only be recommended if your bunions are causing considerable pain and non-surgical treatments have been unsuccessful \n \n Types of surgery \n There are a number of different surgical procedures used to treat bunions. The type of surgery recommended for you will depend on the severity of the deformity. \n Your surgeon may use pins, wires or screws to hold the bones in place while they heal. Depending on the type of surgery you have, these may be left in your foot or removed later on.\u00a0 \n Some of the surgical procedures for bunions are described below. \n Osteotomy \n Osteotomy is the most commonly used and proven\u00a0type of bunion surgery. Although there are many different types of osteotomy, they generally involve cutting and removing part of the bone in your toe. \n During the procedure, your surgeon will remove the bony lump and realign the bones inside your big toe. They'll also move your toe joint back in line, which may involve removing other pieces of bone, possibly from the neighbouring toes.\u00a0 \n A procedure called distal soft tissue realignment may be combined with an osteotomy. This involves altering the tissue in your foot to help correct the deformity and improve the stability and appearance of the foot. \n Arthrodesis \n Arthrodesis involves fusing together two bones in your big toe joint (metatarsophalangeal joint). \n The procedure is usually only recommended for people with severe deformities of the big toe joint, which make it too difficult for doctors to completely fix the joint, or when there's advanced degeneration of the joint. \n After arthrodesis, the movement of your big toe will be severely limited and you won't be able to wear high heels. \n Excision (Keller's) arthroplasty \n An excision arthroplasty involves removing the bunion and the\u00a0toe joint.\u00a0A false joint is created by scar tissue that forms as a result of the operation. \n The procedure involves pinning the joint in place with wires, which will be removed around three weeks after surgery is carried out.\u00a0 \n An excision arthroplasty can only be used in certain circumstances, and is usually reserved for severe, troublesome bunions in elderly people.\u00a0 \n Minimally invasive bunion surgery \n In 2010, the\u00a0 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) \u00a0published guidance about a minimally invasive surgical procedure to treat bunions.\u00a0The aim of the procedure is to repair\u00a0the tilting of the big toe. \n The technique can be carried out under a  local anaesthetic  or a  general anaesthetic , using  X-rays \u00a0or an endoscope for guidance. The type of endoscope used will be a long, thin, rigid\u00a0tube with a light source and video camera at one end \n One or more incisions will be made near the big toe so that bone-cutting instruments can be inserted. These will be used to remove the bunion and to divide one or more bones located at the front of the foot. \n Wires, screws or plates will be used to keep the divided bones in place. After the procedure, you may need to wear a plaster cast or dressing to keep your foot in the correct position until the bones have healed. You may be given a special surgical shoe that enables you to walk on your heel. \n As the procedure is relatively new, there's little in the way of reliable evidence regarding its safety or effectiveness. \n See the NICE guidance about the  surgical correction of hallux valgus using minimal access techniques (PDF, 93kb) . \n After surgery \n After bunion surgery, your foot and ankle may be swollen for three months or longer. While you're recovering, you'll need to keep your foot raised to reduce swelling, and you'll need crutches to move around. \n It's likely that you'll be unable to wear normal shoes for at least six\u00a0months after surgery. You may have a cast or bandage and postoperative shoes (shoes specially designed to allow heel walking and protect the bony cuts) before you can start wearing regular footwear. This will keep the bones and soft tissues in place while they heal.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bronchitis", "introduction": "Bronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed. \n The main symptom is a  cough , which may bring up yellow-grey mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause a\u00a0 sore throat \u00a0and wheezing. \n Read more about the  symptoms of bronchitis . \n When to see your GP \n Most cases of bronchitis can be treated easily at home with rest,  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and plenty of fluids. \n You only need to see your GP if your symptoms are severe or unusual \u2013 for example, if: \n \n your cough is severe or lasts longer than three weeks \n you have a constant fever\u00a0(a temperature of 38\u00b0C\u00a0\u2013\u00a0100.4\u00b0F\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or above) for more than three days \n you cough up mucus streaked with blood \n you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as\u00a0 asthma  or\u00a0 heart failure  \n \n Your GP may need to rule out other lung infections, such as  pneumonia , which has symptoms similar to those of bronchitis. If your GP thinks you may have pneumonia, you will probably need a chest X-ray, and a sample of mucus may be taken for testing. \n If your GP thinks you might have an undiagnosed underlying condition, they may also suggest a pulmonary function test. You will be asked to take a deep breath and blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures the volume of air in your lungs. Decreased lung capacity can indicate an underlying health problem. \n Treating bronchitis \n In most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without the need for treatment. This type of bronchitis is known as \"acute bronchitis\". While you are waiting for it to pass, you should drink lots of fluid and get plenty of rest. \n In some cases, the symptoms of bronchitis can last much longer. If symptoms last for at least three months, it is known as \"chronic bronchitis\". There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but there are several medications to help relieve symptoms. It is also important to avoid smoking and smoky environments, as this can make your symptoms worse. \n Read more about  treating bronchitis . \n Why do I have bronchitis? \n The bronchi are the main airways in your lungs, which branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles. \n The walls of the bronchi produce mucus to trap dust and other particles that could otherwise cause irritation. \n Most cases of acute bronchitis\u00a0develop when an infection causes the bronchi to become irritated and inflamed, which causes them to produce more mucus than usual. Your body tries to shift this extra mucus through coughing. \n Smoking is the most common cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time, tobacco smoke can cause permanent damage to the bronchi, causing them to become inflamed. \n Read more about the  causes of bronchitis . \n Complications \n  Pneumonia  is the most common complication of bronchitis. It\u00a0happens when the\u00a0infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid.\u00a01 in 20 cases of bronchitis leads to pneumonia. \n People at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include: \n \n elderly people \n people who smoke \n people with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease \n people with a weakened immune system \n \n Mild pneumonia can usually be treated with  antibiotics  at home. More severe cases may require admission to hospital. \n Read more about the  treatment of pneumonia . \n Who is affected \n Acute bronchitis is one of the most common types of lung infection, and is one of the top five reasons for GP visits. \n Acute bronchitis can affect people of all ages, but is most common in younger children under the age of five. It is more common in winter, and often develops following a  cold ,\u00a0sore throat or  flu . \n It is estimated that there are around 2 million people in the UK affected by chronic bronchitis. Most of these are adults over the age of 50.", "symptoms": "The main symptom of bronchitis is a hacking cough. It is likely that your cough will bring up thick yellow-grey mucus (phlegm), although this does not always happen. \n Other symptoms of bronchitis are similar to those of other infections, such as the  common cold  or  sinusitis , and may include: \n \n sore throat \n headache \n runny or blocked nose \n aches and pains \n tiredness \n \n If you have bronchitis,\u00a0your cough may last for several weeks after other symptoms have gone. You may also find that the continual coughing makes your chest and stomach muscles sore. \n Some people may experience shortness of breath\u00a0or wheezing, due to inflamed airways. However, this is more common with long-term (chronic) bronchitis. \n Long-term (chronic) bronchitis \n Chronic bronchitis is often known as  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . \n The symptoms of COPD can include: \n \n wheezing \n increasing breathlessness when exercising or moving around \n a persistent cough that brings up mucus (phlegm) \n frequent  chest infections  \n \n The symptoms are often worse in the winter, and it is common to have two or more flare-ups a year. A flare-up is when your symptoms are particularly bad. \n When to see your GP \n See your GP as soon as possible if: \n \n your cough is very severe or lasts longer than three weeks \n you have a constant fever (a temperature of 38\u00b0C \u2013 100.4\u00b0F \u2013 or above) for more than three days \u2013 this may be a sign of  flu  or a more serious condition, such as  pneumonia  \n you cough up mucus streaked with blood \n you develop rapid breathing (more than 30 breaths a minute) or chest pains \n you become drowsy or confused \n you have had repeated bouts of bronchitis \n \n You should also contact your GP if you have an underlying heart or lung condition, such as: \n \n  asthma  \n  heart failure  \u2013 weakness in the heart that leads to fluid in your lungs \n emphysema \u2013 damage to the small airways in your lungs", "causes": "The bronchitis infection can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, although viral bronchitis is much more common. \n In most cases, bronchitis is caused by the same viruses that cause the\u00a0 common cold  or  flu . The virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone coughs or sneezes. \n These droplets typically spread about 1m (3ft). They hang suspended in the air for a while, then land on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to\u00a024 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus further by touching something else. \n Everyday items at home and in public places, such as door handles and keyboards,\u00a0may have traces of the virus on them. People usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects, and then placing their hands near their nose or mouth. It is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets. \n Breathing in\u00a0irritant substances \n Bronchitis can also be triggered by breathing in irritant substances, such as smog, chemicals in household products or tobacco smoke. \n Smoking is the main cause of long-term (chronic) bronchitis, and it can affect people who inhale second-hand smoke, as well as smokers themselves. \n Read information about  treatments to quit smoking . \n Occupational exposure \n You may also be at risk of bronchitis and other forms of\u00a0 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  if you are often exposed to materials that can damage your lungs, such as: \n \n grain dust \n textiles (fabric fibres) \n ammonia \n strong acids \n chlorine \n \n This is sometimes referred to as \"occupational bronchitis\", and usually eases once you are no longer exposed to the irritant substance. \n Read more information about the  causes of COPD . \n You can also read\u00a0the\u00a0 Health and Safety Executive's 2013\u00a0report on COPD in Great Britain\u00a0attributed to occupational exposure (PDF, 58kb) .", "treatment": "Most cases of bronchitis do not require treatment from a GP, and the symptoms can be easily managed at home. \n There is no cure for chronic bronchitis, but healthy living\u00a0will help. In particular,\u00a0you should\u00a0 stop smoking ,\u00a0if you smoke. \n Managing symptoms at home \n If you have bronchitis: \n \n get plenty of rest \n drink lots of fluids \u2013 this helps prevent  dehydration  and thins the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up \n treat headaches, fever, and aches and pains with\u00a0 paracetamol  or\u00a0 ibuprofen  \u2013 although ibuprofen is not recommended if you have  asthma \u00a0 \n \n There is little evidence that cough medicines work \u2013  read\u00a0more about\u00a0treating coughs . The\u00a0Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)\u00a0has recommended that over-the-counter cough medicines should not be given to children under the age of six. \n As an alternative to an\u00a0over-the-counter\u00a0cough medicine, try making your own mixture of honey and lemon, which can help soothe a\u00a0 sore throat  and ease your cough. \n Stop smoking \n If you smoke, you should stop immediately. Smoking aggravates\u00a0bronchitis and increases your risk of developing a long-term (chronic) condition. \n  Stopping smoking  while you have bronchitis can also be the perfect opportunity to quit altogether. \n Antibiotics \n Although treatment from a GP is rarely necessary, there may be times when you should see one \u2013 read more about\u00a0 when to see your GP . \n Your GP will not routinely prescribe\u00a0 antibiotics , as bronchitis is nearly always caused by a virus. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, and prescribing them when they are unnecessary can, over time, make bacteria more resistant to antibiotic treatment.\u00a0 \n Your GP will only prescribe antibiotics if you have an increased risk of developing complications, such as  pneumonia .\u00a0Antibiotics may be recommended for: \n \n premature babies \n elderly people over the age of 80 \n people with a history of heart, lung, kidney or liver disease \n people with a weakened immune system, which could be the result of an underlying condition or a side effect of a treatment such as steroid medication \n people with\u00a0 cystic fibrosis  \n \n If you are prescribed antibiotics for bronchitis, it is likely to be a five-day course of amoxicillin, oxytetracycline or doxycycline. \n Possible side effects of these medicines include nausea, vomiting and\u00a0diarrhoea, but they are uncommon. \n Chronic bronchitis \n Chronic bronchitis is treated in the same way as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n For example: \n \n a type of medication called mucolytics can be used to make mucus easier to cough up \n an exercise programme known as pulmonary rehabilitation can help you cope better with your symptoms \n \n Stopping smoking is also very important if you have been diagnosed with chronic bronchitis or COPD. \n Read more about the  treatment of COPD .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Breast cancer (male)", "introduction": "Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it. \n It's\u00a0much less common in men than women, with only around\u00a01 new case of breast cancer diagnosed for every 100,000 men (about 350 to 400 cases) in the UK each year. \n The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples. The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts. \n However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by\u00a0a condition called  gynaecomastia . This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. \n Breast cancer in men can also cause nipple problems, such as the nipple turning in on itself (retraction) or nipple discharge. \n Read more about the  symptoms of male breast cancer  \n When to see your GP \n You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge. \n While these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further.\u00a0 \n Why it happens \n The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include: \n \n age \u2013 most cases affect men over the age of\u00a060 \n having a family history of breast cancer (male or female) \n  obesity \u00a0\u2013 a  body mass index (BMI)  of 30 or more \n \n Read more about\u00a0 causes of breast cancer in men  \n Treating breast cancer in men \n In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually\u00a0a drug\u00a0called tamoxifen. \n Tamoxifen helps block the effects of hormones\u00a0known to stimulate the growth of cancerous cells in breast tissue. It should help prevent the cancer returning. \n In some cases,  radiotherapy  or  chemotherapy  may be used for the same purpose. \n Read more about  treating breast cancer in men  \n Outlook \n The outlook for breast cancer is not as good in men as in women. This is because there's reduced awareness of the condition and it may take longer to diagnose. \n The survival rates for breast cancer in men largely depend on how far the cancer has spread before it's diagnosed. \n Breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage can often be treated successfully, but effective treatment is more difficult if the cancer has spread beyond the breast tissue. \n Unfortunately, many cases are diagnosed after the cancer has already started to spread. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing breast cancer\u00a0in men . \n Reducing your risk \n The most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to: \n \n  drink alcohol in moderation  \u2013 men are advised to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week; a unit is approximately half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits \n  maintain a healthy weight  \u2013 through a combination of eating a\u00a0 healthy diet  and exercising regularly \n \n Read more about  preventing cancer", "symptoms": "The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless. \n The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple). \n However, the vast majority of breast lumps are\u00a0caused by\u00a0a condition called  gynaecomastia . This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged. \n Less common symptoms of male breast cancer\u00a0include: \n \n the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction) \n the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration) \n fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge) \n \n Advanced symptoms \n Additional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. This is known as metastatic breast cancer. \n Symptoms of metastatic breast cancer include: \n \n bone pain \n swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit \n shortness of breath \n feeling unusually tired all the time \n feeling sick (nausea) \n itchy skin\u00a0with\u00a0yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n \n When to seek medical advice \n You should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have\u00a0problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge.\u00a0 \n These problems\u00a0are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they\u00a0should be\u00a0investigated further.", "causes": "It's not clear exactly what causes breast cancer in men, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition. \n Age \n Like many cancers, men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer as they get older. Most cases are diagnosed in men aged 60 to 70. It's rare for young men to\u00a0develop the condition. \n Genetics and family history \n A genetic mutation is\u00a0a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene.\u00a0The result is that\u00a0one or more of the body's processes may not work in the way they should. \n There are a number of genetic mutations known to increase your risk of developing breast cancer. The most significant mutation identified is known as the BRCA2 mutation. Faulty genes are believed to be the cause of male breast cancer in around\u00a01 or 2 in every 10 cases. \n There's also evidence that breast cancer can run in families, especially in men who have a first-degree relative who has developed breast cancer,\u00a0such as a mother or sister. \n Routine testing for the faulty genes that cause breast cancer in men isn't usually carried out on the NHS, unless specifically requested by a specialist. However,\u00a0some private clinics may offer gene testing. Tests can be expensive, with prices ranging from around \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000. \n Oestrogen \n There's evidence that high levels of the hormone oestrogen, or prolonged exposure to it, can increase the risk of breast cancer in men. \n Compared\u00a0with women, men tend to have low levels of oestrogen, but there are circumstances that can increase the levels of oestrogen in men. These include: \n \n hormone treatments \u2013 man-made (synthetic) versions of oestrogen are often used to treat prostate cancer, and are also given to transgender patients\u00a0undergoing a male to female sex change \n obesity \u2013 obese men have higher levels of oestrogen than normal \n  cirrhosis  \u2013 this is scarring of the liver, often caused by long-term  alcohol misuse  \n \n There is also a rare genetic condition affecting males called  Klinefelter syndrome . This is a congenital condition boys are born with that means\u00a0those who are\u00a0affected\u00a0produce less of the hormone testosterone than usual. \n As testosterone usually helps to limit the effect of oestrogen, men with Klinefelter syndrome are more likely to develop breast cancer than the general male population. \n Occupational risks \n There's some evidence men who work in hot environments are twice as likely to develop breast cancer compared with men who work in cooler environments. \n Environments linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in men include: \n \n blast furnaces \n steel works \n rolling mills \u2013 a factory where metal (usually steel) is shaped using rollers \n car manufacturing plants \n \n One hypothesis to help explain the link between working environment and the increased risk of developing breast cancer is that excessive heat may damage the testicles, which could lead to an increase in oestrogen levels. \n Another hypothesis is that working in hot environments usually involves exposure to certain chemicals that may increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men. \n Rates of breast cancer are also unusually high in men who manufacture perfumes and soaps. They are seven times more likely to develop breast cancer than the male population at large. \n The reason for this increased risk is still unclear. Exposure to certain chemicals seems to be an obvious possibility, but this hasn't yet been proven. \n Radiation \n Exposure to radiation has been linked to an increased risk of developing breast cancer in men. \n Research has found men who received a course of  radiotherapy \u00a0\u2013 where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells\u00a0\u2013\u00a0directed at the upper chest were seven times more likely to develop male breast cancer compared\u00a0with the population at large. \n However, even a seven-fold increase means the chance of developing breast cancer is still very low.", "treatment": "Treatment for breast cancer in men largely depends on how far the cancer has spread. \n Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat men with breast cancer. These are teams of specialists\u00a0who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. \n Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the ideal treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. \n Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you'd like to ask the specialist. For example, you could ask about\u00a0the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments. \n Your treatment plan \n Your recommended treatment plan depends on how far the cancer has spread. If the cancer hasn't spread significantly beyond your breast, a complete cure may be possible. \n In these cases, surgery to remove the affected breast is usually recommended. This is often followed by  radiotherapy , hormone therapy, or  chemotherapy  to help prevent the cancer returning. \n If the cancer has spread beyond your breast into other parts of your body, such as your lungs, a complete cure won't be possible. However, hormone therapy and chemotherapy can be used to relieve symptoms and slow down the spread of the cancer. \n More information about these treatments can be found below. \n Surgery \n An operation called a  mastectomy  is usually recommended as the first treatment for breast cancer. \n A mastectomy involves removing the entire breast,\u00a0sometimes with the nipple and lymph nodes (glands) in the armpit. A procedure known as a\u00a0sentinel lymph node biopsy may also be performed. \n In some cases, part of the muscle under the breast may also be removed if there's a risk the cancer has spread to this area. \n Once surgery has been completed, there will be a straight scar across your chest where your nipple used to be and possibly an indentation around the area where the breast tissue used to be. \n After surgery \n Most men are well enough to leave hospital one to three days after surgery. \n After the operation, it's likely you'll feel very tired and it may take a few weeks before you're well enough to start carrying out relatively strenuous activities, such as lifting objects or driving. Your specialist nurse will be able to offer more specific advice about this. \n The wound takes about two to three weeks to heal. It's important to keep the wound clean during this time. \n You should look for any signs that the wound may have become infected, such as redness and swelling around the wound or a discharge of pus. Inform your MDT as soon as possible if you suspect an infection. \n It's difficult to predict when you'll feel able to return to work. Some people choose to remain off work until other treatments, such as radiotherapy, have been completed. \n Others prefer to return to work in between treatments. Your MDT will be able to advise you, but the final decision will be yours. \n It can take several weeks to fully recover from the effects of a mastectomy. A structured exercise programme, where the intensity and amount of time spent exercising is gradually increased, will probably be recommended. \n Your\u00a0treatment team\u00a0will be able to provide you with more advice or refer you to a physiotherapist (a specialist with training in rehabilitation using exercise). \n Complications of surgery \n After\u00a0surgery, you may experience numbness or tingling at the site of the scar and in your upper arm. This is common, and is\u00a0caused by nerve damage during surgery. \n The numbness and tingling should pass within a few weeks or months, although it can occasionally be permanent. \n Another\u00a0possible complication is painful swelling in the arms. This is called  lymphoedema , which is caused by the disruption of the lymphatic system (a series of channels and lymph nodes normally responsible for removing excess fluid from tissue). \n If many lymph nodes are surgically removed, it can disrupt the lymphatic system's ability to drain fluid, which can lead to swelling. \n There's no cure for lymphoedema, but it's possible to control the symptoms using a combination of different techniques, such as massage and compression garments. \n See  treating lymphoedema \u00a0for more information \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy  is a type of treatment involving a machine that releases high-energy waves to destroy cancerous cells. It can be given a few weeks after surgery to prevent the cancerous cells returning. \n A typical course of radiotherapy involves two to five sessions a week over the course of three to six weeks. The sessions are short and usually only last for 10 to 15 minutes. \n Radiotherapy isn't usually painful, although you'll probably experience some side effects. This is because the energy released during radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells. \n Common side effects of radiotherapy can include: \n \n extreme tiredness (fatigue) \n feeling sick (nausea) \n sore, red and irritated skin on the breast similar in appearance to  sunburn  \n \n The side effects of radiotherapy should pass after your course of treatment has finished, although some men experience prolonged fatigue for several months. \n Radiotherapy can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer and relieve the symptoms of pain. This is known as palliative radiotherapy. \n Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in just one or two doses and doesn't usually cause any side effects. \n Hormone therapy \n Up to\u00a090% of cases of breast cancers in men are oestrogen receptor positive, or ER+. \"E\" is used because the American spelling of oestrogen is \"estrogen\". \n This means the cancerous cells require oestrogen to grow. Oestrogen is a type of hormone found in low levels in men and much higher levels in women. \n The aim of hormone therapy is to block the effects of oestrogen on the breast tissue to prevent the cancer recurring after surgery. It can also be used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow down the spread of the cancer. \n Tamoxifen \n Tamoxifen is\u00a0one of the hormone-blocking\u00a0medications widely used for breast cancer. It's available in tablet or liquid form, and prevents oestrogen entering the breast tissue cells. \n The ideal length of treatment with tamoxifen is unclear. Studies in women with breast cancer suggest a five-year course of treatment is the most effective for preventing the return of cancer and extending survival rates. However, it's unclear if this also applies to men. \n Tamoxifen can also cause unpleasant side effects, which will be taken into consideration when your\u00a0treatment team\u00a0is deciding which treatments to recommend. You can discuss the pros and cons of long-term treatment with tamoxifen with your doctors. \n Side effects of tamoxifen can\u00a0include: \n \n reduced interest in sex  (loss of\u00a0libido)  \n inability to obtain or maintain an erection  (erectile dysfunction)  \n  headache  \n feeling sick\u00a0\u2013\u00a0taking your medication with food may help reduce this side effect \n changes in mood, such as feeling irritable or  depressed  \n \n You should inform your\u00a0team if you experience side effects that become particularly troublesome, as alternative medications are available. \n Aromatase inhibitors \n Aromatase inhibitors are an alternative\u00a0type of hormone medication. They may be used if tamoxifen proves unsuccessful or the side effects of tamoxifen are particularly troublesome. Aromatase inhibitors can also be used to slow the spread of advanced breast cancer. \n In men, oestrogen is created when a protein called aromatase converts another hormone called androgens. Aromatase inhibitors block the effects of aromatase, which in turn lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body. \n Aromatase inhibitors are usually given in tablet form and taken daily for two to five years. As with tamoxifen, there's little available evidence about the most effective length of dosage in men, compared with female breast cancer. \n Side effects of aromatase inhibitors can include: \n \n joint pain \n lack of energy \n hot flushes \n skin rashes \n feeling sick \n being sick \n thinning of the hair \n \n However, it's unlikely you'll experience any or all of these side effects. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy  is used to treat cases of breast cancer where hormone therapy would be largely ineffective because the cancerous cells are not oestrogen receptor positive (ER+). \n It's usually given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning, or it's used to treat the symptoms of incurable cancer. \n Chemotherapy for breast cancer involves taking a combination of cancer-killing medications. Treatment is usually given every two to three weeks over the course of six months. \n You may be given chemotherapy tablets (oral chemotherapy), chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy), or a combination of both. \n The side effects of chemotherapy can include: \n \n feeling sick \n being sick \n  diarrhoea   \n loss of appetite \n  mouth ulcers  \n tiredness \n skin rashes \n  infertility  \n  hair loss  \n \n The side effects should resolve once your treatment has finished.\u00a0Your hair should grow back about three to six months\u00a0after treatment. \n Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It's important to\u00a0tell your MDT about\u00a0any symptoms of a potential infection, such as: \n \n a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above \n flu-like symptoms, such as chills or joint pain \n a general sense of feeling unwell \n \n You should also avoid close contact with people known to have an infection. \n If you're sexually active, you should use a condom for 48 hours after receiving a dose of chemotherapy medication. This is because the medication used in chemotherapy could pass into your semen and cause irritation in the tissue of your partner's genitals. \n You should avoid having children while receiving chemotherapy as many of the medications can damage your sperm and increase your chances of having a baby with a birth defect. Again, using a reliable method of contraception, such as a condom, is recommended \n Depending on the medications used, it may be several months after your course of chemotherapy has ended before you can safely have children. Your MDT will be able to give you a more detailed recommendation. \n Biological therapy \n Biological therapy uses medication to block the effects of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cases where HER2 is contributing to breast cancer. \n Biological therapies are sometimes referred to as targeted therapies because they are designed to target biological processes that cancers rely on to grow and reproduce. \n If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and\u00a0are able to have biological therapy, you'll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab.\u00a0Also known by the brand name Herceptin, it\u00a0is usually used after radiotherapy or chemotherapy to prevent cancerous cells returning. \n Trastuzumab \n  Trastuzumab  is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in the body and are created by the immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells designed to respond to the HER2 protein. \n Trastuzumab is given through a drip, directly into a vein (intravenously). You'll receive the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour, and the number of sessions you need depends on whether your breast cancer is in its early or more advanced stages. \n On average, for early breast cancer you'll need to have a session once every three weeks, and for more advanced cancer you'll need to have weekly sessions. \n Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means it's not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as  angina , uncontrolled  high blood pressure  (hypertension), or heart valve disease. \n If you need to take trastuzumab, you'll need to have regular tests on your heart to ensure it's not causing any problems. \n Other side effects of trastuzumab\u00a0can include: \n \n an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever \n  diarrhoea  \n tiredness \n aches and pains", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have symptoms of breast cancer, such as a hard, painless lump in one of your breasts, your GP will carefully examine you. \n During the examination, they'll also look for other possible signs of male breast cancer, such as swollen lymph nodes (glands). \n It's likely your GP will refer you for further tests if there's a possibility you may have breast cancer. These tests are described below. \n Mammogram \n A mammogram is a type of  X-ray  used to help determine whether there are any changes in breast tissue that could be the result of cancer. \n During the mammogram procedure, a radiographer (a specialist in taking X-rays) will compress one of your breasts between two X-ray plates. This shouldn't be painful, but you should tell the radiographer if you find it uncomfortable. \n Once your breast has been correctly positioned, an X-ray will be taken that produces a clear image of the inside of your breast. The procedure will then be carried out on your other breast. \n Ultrasound \n An  ultrasound scan  uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, in the same way an unborn baby can be seen in the womb. \n An ultrasound probe or sensor will be placed over your breasts to create an image of the inside of your breasts on a screen. The image will highlight any lumps or abnormalities that may be present in your breasts. \n Biopsy \n A  biopsy  may be recommended if a mammogram or ultrasound scan highlight any lumps or abnormalities in your breasts. \n A biopsy is a test that can either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of breast cancer in men. It involves taking a sample of suspected cancerous tissue and examining it in a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells. \n A type of biopsy known as a core biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis of breast cancer in men. This type of biopsy can usually indicate whether the cancer has started to spread from the breast into the surrounding area. \n During a core biopsy, a  local anaesthetic  will be used to numb your breast. A hollow needle will then be used to remove a number of small tissue samples from the breast lump. \n If cancer is found, it's also possible to check whether there are special proteins, known as oestrogen receptors, on the surface of the cancerous cells. \n This is important, because if oestrogen receptors are found\u00a0\u2013 and they are in more than half\u00a0of cases\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it's possible to treat the cancer with hormone therapy. \n See  treating breast cancer in men  for more information \n Staging \n After breast cancer has been diagnosed, your care team should provide information about the stage of the cancer. Staging is a system used to describe how far a cancer has spread at the point of diagnosis. \n A cure may be possible if breast cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. However, treatment can only be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer if it's diagnosed at a later stage. Unfortunately, more than 40% of breast cancers in men are diagnosed at a late stage. \n In some cases, men are diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This means there are cancer cells in the breast, but they're contained within the breast ducts and can't spread. \n If left untreated, DCIS can lead to invasive breast cancer over a period of time. \n Coping with a diagnosis \n Being told you have breast cancer can cause a wide range of emotions, such as shock, fear, confusion and, in some cases, embarrassment. \n Most people assume breast cancer only affects women, so it can be difficult to come to terms with the diagnosis. \n Feelings of isolation and being alone are common in men with breast cancer. This may be because there's little in the way of advice and support for men with breast cancer, particularly when compared\u00a0with the support available for women with the condition. \n Sometimes men who find themselves in this situation can become depressed. You may be  depressed  if you've felt very down and no longer interested in doing activities you used to enjoy\u00a0during the past month. \n If you think you may be depressed, visit your GP. There are a range of effective treatments, such as medication and counselling, that can help relieve feelings of depression. \n You may also find it useful to talk to other men affected by the condition.  Breast Cancer Care  is a breast cancer charity that provides an  online forum for men diagnosed with breast cancer . Cancer Research UK also provides  Cancer Chat , an online forum for anyone affected by cancer. \n Screening for breast cancer in men \n As breast cancer is\u00a0rare in\u00a0men, routine screening for the condition isn't recommended, even for men in high-risk groups, such as those with a family history of breast cancer or those who have had  radiotherapy ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Cervical cancer", "introduction": "Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina). \n Cancer of the cervix often has no symptoms in its early stages. If you do have symptoms,\u00a0the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between\u00a0 periods  or after the  menopause . \n Abnormal bleeding doesn't mean that you definitely have cervical cancer, but it should be investigated by your GP as soon as possible. If your GP thinks you might have cervical cancer, you should be referred to see a specialist within two weeks. \n Read more about the  symptoms of cervical cancer \u00a0and  diagnosing cervical cancer  \n Screening for cervical cancer \n Over the course of many years, the cells lining the surface of the cervix undergo a series of changes. In rare cases, these precancerous cells can become cancerous. However, cell changes in the cervix can be detected at a very early stage and treatment can reduce the risk of cervical cancer developing. \n The\u00a0NHS offers a cervical screening programme\u00a0to all women from the age of\u00a025. During cervical screening (previously known as a \"smear test\"), a small sample of cells is taken from the cervix and checked under a microscope for abnormalities. \n An abnormal cervical screening test doesn't mean you definitely have cancer. Most abnormal results are\u00a0caused by\u00a0an infection or the presence of treatable precancerous cells, rather than cancer itself. \n Women aged 25 to 49 years of age are offered screening every three years, and women aged 50 to 64 are offered screening every five years.\u00a0For women who are 65 or older,\u00a0only those who haven't been screened since they were 50, or those who have had recent abnormal tests, are offered screening. \n You should be sent a letter confirming when your screening appointment is due. Contact your GP if you think you may be overdue for a screening appointment. \n Read more about  cervical screening  \n What causes cervical cancer? \n Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the  human papilloma virus (HPV) . HPV is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman. \n There are more than 100 different types of HPV, many of which are harmless. However, some types of HPV can cause abnormal changes to the cells of the cervix, which can eventually lead to cervical cancer. \n Two strains of the HPV virus (HPV 16 and HPV 18)\u00a0are known to be responsible for 70% of all cases of cervical cancer.\u00a0These types of HPV infection don't have any symptoms, so many women won't realise they have the infection. \n However, it's important to be aware that these infections are relatively common and most women who\u00a0have\u00a0them don't develop cervical cancer. \n Using\u00a0 condoms  during sex offers some protection against HPV, but it can't always prevent infection, because the virus is also spread through skin-to-skin contact of the wider genital area. \n Since 2008, a\u00a0 HPV vaccine \u00a0has been routinely offered to girls aged 12 and 13. \n Read more about the  causes of cervical cancer \u00a0and  preventing cervical cancer  \n Treating cervical cancer \n If cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it's usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases, it's possible to leave the womb in place, but it\u00a0may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is\u00a0called a  hysterectomy . \n  Radiotherapy  is an alternative to surgery for some women with early stage cervical cancer. In some cases, it's used alongside surgery. \n More advanced cases of cervical cancer are usually treated using a combination of  chemotherapy  and radiotherapy. \n Some of the treatments used can have significant and long-lasting side effects, including  early menopause \u00a0and  infertility . \n Read more about  treating cervical cancer  \n Complications \n Many women with cervical cancer will have complications. These can arise as a direct result of the cancer or as a side effect of treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and\u00a0surgery. \n Complications associated with cervical cancer can range from the relatively minor, such as minor bleeding from the vagina or\u00a0having to urinate frequently, to life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or kidney failure. \n Read more about the  complications of cervical cancer  \n Outlook \n The stage at which cervical cancer is diagnosed is an important factor in determining a woman's outlook. The staging, given as a number from one to four, indicates how far the cancer has spread. \n The chances of living for at least five years after being diagnosed with cervical cancer are: \n \n stage 1 \u2013 80-99% \n stage 2 \u2013 60-90% \n stage 3 \u2013 30-50% \n stage 4 \u2013 20% \n \n Read more about the  staging of cervical cancer  \n In the UK, just under 1,000 women die from cervical cancer every year. \n Who's affected by cervical cancer? \n Following the success of the NHS Cervical Screening Programme and the early detection of cell changes, the number of cervical cancer cases in the UK has reduced. Around 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year. \n It's possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of cervical cancer aren't always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it's reached an advanced stage. \n This is why it's very important that you attend all of your  cervical screening  appointments. \n Unusual bleeding \n In most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex. \n Bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly  period , is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the\u00a0 menopause  (when a woman's monthly periods stop). \n Visit your GP for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding. \n Other symptoms \n Other symptoms of cervical cancer may include pain and discomfort during sex and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge. \n Advanced cervical cancer \n If the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including: \n \n  constipation   \n blood in your urine (haematuria) \n loss of bladder control ( urinary incontinence ) \n bone pain \n swelling of one of your legs \n severe pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a\u00a0condition called hydronephrosis \n changes to your bladder and bowel habits \n loss of appetite \n weight loss \n tiredness and a lack of energy \n \n When to seek medical advice \n You should contact your GP if you experience: \n \n bleeding after sex (postcoital bleeding) \n bleeding outside of your normal periods \n new bleeding after the menopause \n \n Vaginal bleeding is very common and can have a wide range of causes, so it doesn't necessarily mean you have cervical cancer. However, unusual vaginal bleeding is a symptom that needs to be investigated by your GP.", "causes": "In almost all cases, cervical cancer is the result of a change in cell DNA caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). \n Cancer begins with a change in the structure of the DNA that's present in all human cells. DNA provides the cells with a basic set of instructions, including when to grow and reproduce. \n A change in the DNA's structure is known as a mutation. It can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means the cells continue growing instead of stopping when they should. If the cells reproduce uncontrollably, they produce a lump of tissue called a tumour. \n Human papilloma virus (HPV) \n More than\u00a099% of cervical cancer\u00a0cases occur in women who have been previously infected with HPV. HPV is a group of viruses, rather than a single virus. There are more than 100 different types. \n HPV is spread during sexual intercourse and other types of sexual activity (such as skin-to-skin contact of the genital areas, or using sex toys) and is thought to be very common.\u00a0It's estimated that 1 in 3 women will develop a HPV infection within two years of starting to have regular sex, and about 4 in 5\u00a0women will develop the infection at some point in their lives. \n Some types of HPV don't cause any noticeable symptoms and the infection will pass without treatment. Other types of HPV can cause  genital warts , although these types aren't linked to an increased risk of causing cervical cancer. \n About 15 types of HPV are considered high-risk for cervical cancer. The two types known to have the highest risk are HPV 16 and HPV 18, which\u00a0cause about 7 out of every 10 cervical cancers. \n High-risk types of HPV are thought to contain genetic material that can be passed into the cells of the cervix. This material begins to disrupt the normal workings of the cells, which can eventually cause them to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to the growth of a cancerous tumour. \n As most types of HPV don't cause any symptoms, you or your partner could have the virus for months or years without knowing it. \n See\u00a0 preventing cervical cancer  for more information about reducing your chances of developing an HPV infection. \n Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) \n Cancer of the cervix usually takes many years to develop. Before it does, the cells in the cervix often show changes known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or, less commonly, cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN). \n CIN and CGIN are pre-cancerous conditions. Pre-cancerous conditions don't pose an immediate threat to a person's health, but they can potentially develop into cancer in the future. \n However, even if you develop CIN or CGIN, the chances of it developing into cervical cancer are very small, and if the changes are discovered during  cervical screening , treatment is\u00a0highly successful. \n The progression from becoming infected with HPV to developing CIN or CGIN\u00a0and then developing cervical cancer is very slow, often\u00a0taking 10 to 20 years. \n Read more about  cervical screening results  \n Increased risk \n The fact that HPV infection is very common but cervical cancer is relatively uncommon\u00a0suggests that only a very small proportion of women are vulnerable to the effects of an HPV infection. There appear to be additional\u00a0risk factors that affect\u00a0a woman's chance of developing cervical cancer. These include: \n \n smoking \u2013 women who smoke are twice as likely to\u00a0develop cervical cancer than women who don't; this may be caused by the harmful effects of chemicals found in tobacco on the cells of the cervix \n having a weakened immune system \u2013\u00a0this can occur as a result of taking certain medications, such as immunosuppressants, which are used to stop the body rejecting donated organs, or as a result of a condition such as  HIV or AIDS  \n taking the\u00a0 oral contraceptive pill  for more than five years \u2013 women who take the pill are thought to have twice the risk of developing cervical cancer than those who don't, although it's not clear why \n having children (the more children you have, the greater your risk) \u2013 women who have two children have twice the risk of getting cervical cancer compared\u00a0with women who don't have any children \n \n The reason for the link between cervical cancer and childbirth is unclear. One theory is that the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may make the cervix more vulnerable to the effects of HPV. \n The spread of cervical cancer \n If cervical cancer is undiagnosed and untreated, it will slowly spread out of the cervix\u00a0and into the surrounding tissue and organs. The cancer can spread down to the vagina and the surrounding muscles that support the bones of the pelvis. Alternatively, it can spread upwards, blocking the tube that runs from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters). \n The cancer\u00a0can then spread into your bladder, rectum (back passage) and eventually into your liver, bones and lungs. Cancerous cells can also spread through your lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a series of nodes (glands) and channels spread throughout your body in a similar way to the blood circulation system. \n The lymph nodes produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). If you have an infection, the nodes in your neck or under your armpits can become swollen. \n In some cases of early cervical cancer, the lymph nodes close to the cervix contain cancerous cells. In some cases of advanced cervical cancer, lymph nodes in the chest and abdomen can be affected.", "treatment": "Treatment for cervical cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. \n As cancer treatments are often complex, hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat cervical cancer and tailor the treatment programme to the individual. \n MDTs are made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. \n Your cancer team will recommend what they think\u00a0the best treatment options are, but the final decision will be yours. In most cases, the recommendations will be: \n \n early cervical cancer \u2013 surgery to remove some or all of the womb,\u00a0 radiotherapy ,\u00a0or a combination of the two \n advanced cervical cancer \u2013 radiotherapy and/or  chemotherapy , although\u00a0surgery is also sometimes used \n \n The prospect of a complete cure is good for cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage, although the chances of a complete cure decrease the further the cancer has spread. \n In cases where cervical cancer isn't curable, it's often possible to slow its progression, prolong lifespan and relieve any associated symptoms, such as pain and vaginal bleeding. This is known as\u00a0 palliative care . \n The different treatment options are discussed in more detail below. \n Removing abnormal cells \n If your screening results show that you don't have cervical cancer, but there are biological changes that could turn cancerous in the future, a number of treatment options are available. These include: \n \n large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) \u2013 the abnormal cells are cut away using a fine wire and an electrical current \n cone biopsy \u2013 the area of abnormal tissue is removed during surgery \n laser therapy \u2013 a laser is used to burn away the abnormal cells \n \n Read more about  treating abnormal cells in the cervix  \n Surgery \n There are three main types of surgery for cervical cancer. They are: \n \n radical trachelectomy \u2013 the cervix, surrounding tissue and the upper part of the vagina are removed, but the womb is left in place \n hysterectomy \u2013 the cervix and womb are removed; depending on the stage of the cancer, it may also be necessary to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes \n pelvic exenteration \u2013 a major operation in which the cervix, vagina, womb, bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectum are removed \n \n Radical trachelectomy \n A radical trachelectomy is usually only suitable if cervical cancer is diagnosed at a\u00a0very early stage. It's usually offered to women who want to preserve their child-bearing potential. \n During the procedure, the surgeon will make a number of small incisions (cuts)\u00a0in your abdomen. Specially designed instruments will be passed through the incisions and used to remove your cervix and the upper section of your vagina. Lymph nodes from your pelvis may also be removed. Your womb will then be reattached to the lower section of your vagina. \n Compared\u00a0with a hysterectomy or pelvic exenteration,\u00a0the advantage of this type of surgery\u00a0is that your womb remains intact, which means that you may\u00a0still be able to have children. However, it's important to be aware that the surgeons carrying out this operation can't guarantee you'll still be able to have children. \n If you do have children after the operation, your child would have to be delivered by\u00a0caesarean section. It's also usually recommended that you wait 6 to 12 months after having surgery before trying for a baby, so that your womb and vagina have time to heal. \n Radical trachelectomy is a highly skilled procedure. It's only available at a number of specialist centres in the UK, so it may not be available in your area and you may have to travel to another city to be treated. \n Hysterectomy \n A\u00a0 hysterectomy  is usually recommended for early cervical cancer. This may be followed by a course of radiotherapy to help prevent the cancer coming back. \n Two types of hysterectomies\u00a0are used to treat cervical cancer. They are: \n \n simple hysterectomy \u2013 where the cervix and womb are removed and, in some cases, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed; this is only appropriate for very early stage cervical cancers \n radical hysterectomy \u2013 where the cervix, womb, surrounding tissue and lymph nodes, ovaries and fallopian tubes are all removed; this is the preferred option in advanced stage one and some early stage two cervical cancers \n \n Short-term complications of a hysterectomy include infection, bleeding, blood clots and accidental injury to your ureter, bladder\u00a0or rectum. \n The risk of long-term complications is\u00a0small, but they can be troublesome. They include: \n \n the risk that your vagina can\u00a0become shortened and drier, which can make sex painful \n  urinary incontinence  \n swelling of your arms and legs, caused by a build-up of fluid ( lymphoedema ) \n your bowel becomes obstructed\u00a0because of\u00a0a build-up of scar tissue\u00a0\u2013 this may require further surgery to correct \n \n As your womb is removed during a hysterectomy, you'll no longer be able to have children. \n If your ovaries are removed, it will also trigger the  menopause \u00a0if you haven't already experienced it. See  complications of cervical cancer  for more information about the menopause. \n Pelvic exenteration \n A pelvic exenteration is a major operation that's usually only recommended when cervical cancer returns after what was thought to be a previously successful course of treatment. It's offered if the cancer returns to the pelvis, but hasn't spread beyond this area. \n A pelvic exenteration involves two phases of treatment: \n \n the cancer is removed, plus your bladder, rectum, vagina and the lower section of your bowel \n two holes called stomas are created in your abdomen\u00a0\u2013 the holes are used to pass urine and faeces out of your body into collection pouches called colostomy bags \n \n Following a pelvic exenteration, your vagina can be reconstructed using skin and tissue taken from other parts of your body. This means you'll be able to have sex after the procedure, although it may be several months until you feel well enough to do so. \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0may be\u00a0used on its own or combined with surgery\u00a0for early stage\u00a0cervical cancer. It may be combined with chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer, where it can be used to control bleeding and pain. \n There are two ways that radiotherapy can be delivered. These are: \n \n externally \u2013 a machine beams high-energy waves into your pelvis to destroy cancerous cells \n internally \u2013 a radioactive implant is placed inside your vagina and cervix \n \n In most cases, a combination of internal and external radiotherapy will be used. A course of radiotherapy usually lasts for around five to eight weeks. \n As well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can sometimes also harm healthy tissue.\u00a0This means it can cause significant side effects many months, and even years, after treatment. \n However,\u00a0the benefits of radiotherapy often tend to outweigh the risks. For some people, radiotherapy offers the only hope of getting rid of the cancer. \n  Side effects of radiotherapy \u00a0are common and can include: \n \n  diarrhoea  \n pain when urinating \n bleeding from your vagina or rectum \n feeling very tired (fatigue) \n feeling sick (nausea) \n sore skin in your pelvis region\u00a0similar to sunburn \n narrowing of your vagina, which can make having sex painful \n  infertility  \n damage to the ovaries, which will usually trigger an early menopause (if you haven't already experienced it) \n bladder and bowel damage, which could lead to incontinence \n \n Most of these side effects will resolve within about eight weeks of finishing treatment, although in some cases they can be permanent. It's also possible to develop side effects several months, or even years, after treatment has finished. \n If infertility is a concern for you, it may be possible to surgically remove eggs from your ovaries before you have radiotherapy, so that they can be implanted in your womb at a later date. However, you may have to pay for this. \n It may also be possible to prevent an early menopause by surgically removing your ovaries and replanting them outside\u00a0the area of your pelvis that will be affected by radiation. This is known as an ovarian transposition. \n Your MDT can provide more information about the possible options for treating infertility and whether you're suitable for an ovarian transposition. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy  can be combined with radiotherapy to try\u00a0to cure cervical cancer, or it can be used as a sole treatment for advanced cancer to slow\u00a0its progression and relieve symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). \n Chemotherapy involves using either a single chemotherapy medication called cisplatin or a combination of different chemotherapy medications to kill the\u00a0cancerous cells.\u00a0 \n Chemotherapy is usually given using an intravenous drip on an outpatient basis, so you'll be able to go home once you've received your dose. \n As with radiotherapy, these medications can also damage healthy tissue. Side effects are therefore\u00a0common and can\u00a0include: \n \n nausea and vomiting \n diarrhoea \n feeling tired all the time \n reduced production of blood cells, which can make you feel tired and breathless (anaemia) and vulnerable to infection because of a lack of white blood cells \n  mouth ulcers \u00a0 \n loss of appetite \n  hair loss \u00a0\u2013 your hair should grow back within three to six months of your course of chemotherapy being completed, although not all chemotherapy medications cause hair loss \n \n Some types of chemotherapy medication can damage your kidneys, so you may need to have regular\u00a0 blood tests  to assess the health of your kidneys. \n Follow-up \n After your treatment has been completed and the cancer has been removed, you'll need to attend regular appointments for testing. This will usually involve a physical examination of your vagina and cervix (if it hasn't been removed). \n As there's a risk of cervical cancer returning, these examinations will be used to look for signs of this. If anything suspicious is found,\u00a0a further biopsy can be carried out. \n If cervical cancer does return, it usually returns around 18 months after a course of treatment has been completed. \n Follow-up appointments are usually recommended every four months after treatment has been completed for the first two years, and then every six to 12 months for a further three years.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If cervical cancer is suspected, you'll be referred to a gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system). \n Referral will be recommended if the results of your  cervical screening test  suggest that there are abnormalities in the cells of your cervix. However, in most cases, the abnormalities don't mean you have cervical cancer. \n You may also be referred to a gynaecologist if you have abnormal vaginal\u00a0bleeding, or if your GP has noticed a growth inside your cervix during an examination. \n The sexually transmitted infection (STI)  chlamydia  is one of the most common reasons why women experience unusual vaginal bleeding. Your GP may recommend that you're tested for it first before being referred.  Testing for chlamydia  involves taking a small tissue sample from your cervix, or carrying out a urine test. \n Colposcopy \n If you've had an abnormal cervical screening test result, or your symptoms suggest that you may have cervical cancer, your gynaecologist will usually carry out a  colposcopy . This is an examination to look for abnormalities in your cervix. \n During a colposcopy, a small microscope with a light source at the end (colposcope) is used. As well as examining your cervix, your gynaecologist may remove a small tissue sample ( biopsy ) so that it can be checked under a microscope for cancerous cells. \n Cone biopsy \n In some cases, a minor operation called a cone biopsy may also be carried out. The operation is carried out in hospital, usually under a  local anaesthetic . \n During a cone biopsy, a small, cone-shaped section of your cervix will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. You may experience vaginal bleeding for up to four weeks after the procedure. You may also have period-like pains. \n Further testing \n If the results of the biopsy suggest you have cervical cancer and there's a risk that the cancer may have spread, you'll probably need to have some further tests to assess how widespread the cancer is. These tests may include: \n \n a pelvic examination carried out under  general anaesthetic  \u2013 your womb, vagina, rectum and bladder will be checked for cancer \n  blood tests \u00a0\u2013\u00a0these can be used to help assess the state of your liver, kidneys and bone marrow \n  computerised tomography (CT) scan \u00a0\u2013 scans are taken of the inside of your body and a computer is used to assemble them into a detailed three-dimensional image; the CT scan can help to identify cancerous tumours and show whether cancerous cells have spread \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0\u2013 this type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the inside of your body; it can also be used to check whether cancer has spread \n chest  X-ray  \u2013 this will indicate whether cancer has spread to your lungs \n  positive emission tomography (PET) scan \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a specialised scan, where a mildly radioactive substance is injected into your veins so the cancerous tissue shows up more clearly; it's often combined with a CT scan\u00a0and is used to see if the cancer has spread, or to check how well a person is responding to treatment \n \n Staging \n After all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell you what stage cancer you have. Staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. The higher the stage, the further the cancer has spread. The staging for cervical cancer is as follows: \n \n stage 0 (pre-cancer) \u2013 there are no cancerous cells in the cervix, but there are biological changes that could trigger cancer in the future; this is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ (CIS) \n stage 1 \u2013 the cancer is still contained inside the cervix \n stage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread outside of the cervix into the surrounding tissue, but hasn't reached the tissues lining the pelvis (pelvic wall) or the lower part of the vagina \n stage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread into the lower section of the vagina and/or into the pelvic wall \n stage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread into the bowel, bladder or other organs, such as\u00a0the lungs"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Catarrh", "introduction": "Catarrh is a build-up of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body. \n It usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face). \n It's often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is known as chronic catarrh. \n Catarrh can be a nuisance and may be difficult to get rid of, but it's not harmful and there are treatments available. \n Symptoms associated with catarrh \n Catarrh can lead to a: \n \n constant need to clear your throat \n feeling\u00a0that your throat is blocked \n blocked\u00a0or stuffy nose that you can't clear \n runny nose \n feeling of mucus running down the back of your throat \n persistent  cough  \n  headache  or facial pain \n reduced sense of\u00a0smell and taste \n crackling sensation in your ear and some temporary hearing loss \n \n These problems can be frustrating to live with and may\u00a0affect your sleep, making you feel tired. \n Treatments for catarrh \n Catarrh will often pass\u00a0in a few days or weeks as the condition that causes it improves. \n There are things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms, such as: \n \n avoiding things that trigger your symptoms, such as allergens or smoky\u00a0places \n taking sips of cold water when you feel the need to clear your throat \u2013 constantly clearing your throat may make things worse \n using a saline nasal rinse several times a day \u2013 these can be bought from a\u00a0pharmacy or made at home with half a teaspoon of salt in a pint of boiled\u00a0water that's been left to cool \n avoiding warm, dry atmospheres, such as\u00a0places with air conditioning and car heating systems \u2013 placing plants or bowls of water in a room\u00a0may help to keep the\u00a0air humid \n staying well hydrated \n talking to a pharmacist about suitable over-the-counter medications \u2013 including  decongestants ,\u00a0antihistamines or\u00a0 steroid  nasal sprays \n \n There are also several remedies, such as herbal medicines, available from health shops and pharmacies that claim to treat catarrh. Some people find these helpful, but there's generally little scientific evidence to suggest they work. \n When to see your GP \n Speak to your GP if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with. \n They may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as\u00a0nasal polyps\u00a0or  allergies . This may mean you\u00a0need to be referred to a specialist for tests. \n If you're diagnosed with a specific underlying\u00a0condition, treating it may help relieve your catarrh. For example, nasal polyps\u00a0may be treated with a steroid nasal spray, or in some cases surgery.\u00a0 \n If a cause for you catarrh cannot be found, the self-help techniques above may be recommended.\u00a0Unfortunately, however,\u00a0chronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last for a long time. \n What causes catarrh? \n Catarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation, which causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus. \n This\u00a0can be triggered by: \n \n a\u00a0 cold  or other infections \n  hay fever  or other types of  allergic rhinitis  \n non-allergic rhinitis \n nasal polyps \n \n It's\u00a0unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it's not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection. \n It may be related to an abnormality in the way mucus\u00a0travels within\u00a0the nose or an increased\u00a0sensitivity to mucus in the back of the\u00a0nose\u00a0and throat.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

A bursa is a fluid-filled sac which forms under the skin, usually over the joints, and acts as a cushion between the tendons and bones. \n The main\u00a0 symptoms of bursitis \u00a0are pain, swelling and tenderness in the affected area. \n Any bursa can become inflamed, but\u00a0bursitis most commonly occurs in the: \n \n shoulder \n elbow\u00a0 \n knee (known as housemaid's knee) \n hip \n \n Other areas affected can include the ankle, foot and Achilles tendon (the large tendon that attaches the heel bone to the calf muscle).\u00a0 \n What causes bursitis? \n A bursa can become inflamed through injury or repetitive movement. \n Your risk of developing bursitis is increased if you regularly take part in physical activities that involve a lot of repetitive movement, for example running (bursitis in the ankle) or playing darts (bursitis in the elbow). \n People who spend a lot of time kneeling, such as carpet fitters and gardeners, also have an increased risk of developing bursitis in their knee. \n Less commonly, bursitis can\u00a0develop as a result of an infection or as a complication of certain conditions, such as\u00a0 gout  or  rheumatoid arthritis . \n Read more about the  causes of\u00a0bursitis . \n Treating bursitis \n Most cases of bursitis can be treated at home.\u00a0Resting the affected area, using an ice pack\u00a0(a frozen bag of vegetables wrapped in a tea towel works well)\u00a0to reduce inflammation, and taking painkillers such as aspirin, paracetamol and  ibuprofen  will\u00a0help relieve your symptoms and speed up your recovery. \n The pain usually improves within a few weeks, but\u00a0the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. \n See\u00a0your GP if your symptoms do not improve after two weeks. \n Read more about  treating bursitis . \n Preventing bursitis \n Taking precautions, such as wearing knee pads when kneeling and  warming up properly before exercise , may help reduce your risk of getting bursitis. \n Read more about\u00a0 preventing\u00a0bursitis .", "symptoms": "Bursitis causes pain, inflammation and tenderness in the affected area of the body. \n The severity of bursitis depends on how\u00a0inflamed the bursa is.\u00a0It can cause swelling and stiffness and the affected area may also be warm and red. \n The pain of bursitis usually feels like a dull\u00a0ache made worse by movement or pressure. Supporting your body\u00a0weight\u00a0may be painful. For example, if you have bursitis in your hip, you\u00a0may find it difficult\u00a0to lie on the affected side. \n Septic bursitis \n Septic bursitis is bursitis caused by infection.\u00a0This can cause\u00a0additional symptoms, such as: \n \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n feeling shivery \n an infection of the deeper layers of the skin ( cellulitis )\u00a0\u00a0 \n broken skin\u00a0over the affected area\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you have symptoms of bursitis and a fever as it's likely\u00a0you have an infection. \n Otherwise,\u00a0see your GP if your symptoms don't improve after two weeks.", "causes": "Bursitis can develop in three main ways. It can be caused by an injury or infection, or as the result of a pre-existing health condition. \n Injury \n If a bursa\u00a0(the small fluid-filled sac which forms around the joints) is injured, the tissue inside it can become irritated, leading to inflammation (swelling). \n In most cases, the injury develops over\u00a0time because joints, muscles and tendons near the bursae are overused. Repetitive movement is a particular risk for this type of injury. \n Ways\u00a0that the bursa can be injured include: \n \n lifting or reaching overhead can damage the shoulder \n repeatedly bending and straightening the elbow, or falling on it \n repeatedly moving the knee\u00a0or kneeling on it\u00a0(bursitis of the knee is known as \"housemaid's knee\") \n excessive walking (particularly if you are not wearing suitable walking shoes) or activities such as ice skating or athletics can damage the ankle\u00a0 \n running can injure the hips \n leaning your elbows or kneeling on hard surfaces\u00a0 \n \n A\u00a0bursa\u00a0can also be injured following a sudden impact, such as banging your elbow or by falling heavily on to your knees. \n Infection \n Bursae near the surface of your skin, such as those near your elbow, can become infected if bacteria find their way into cuts and grazes and then move into a bursa. Bursitis caused by an infection is\u00a0known as\u00a0septic burstitis. \n The immune system (the body's natural defence against injury and illness) usually prevents this type\u00a0of infection, so\u00a0septic bursitis tends to only occur in people with a weakened immune system. This can be\u00a0because of\u00a0a long-term condition, such as\u00a0 HIV or AIDS , or taking\u00a0certain medication, such as  corticosteroids  or  chemotherapy . Alcoholism, diabetes and some kidney conditions can\u00a0also put people at a higher risk. \n Health conditions \n A\u00a0number of health conditions can sometimes cause a bursa to become inflamed. These include: \n \n  gout \u00a0and pseudogout \u2013 a condition caused by a build-up of uric acid in the blood \n  rheumatoid arthritis \u00a0\u2013 where the immune system attacks the linings of the joints \n scleroderma\u00a0\u2013 a condition that causes hardening of the skin \n  ankylosing spondylitis \u00a0\u2013 a type of long-term arthritis that affects parts of the spine \n systemic lupus erythemsystematosus\u00a0\u2013 a poorly understood condition that affects many of the body's tissues and organs \n being overweight can also cause bursitis", "treatment": "Most cases of bursitis can be treated at home with self-care techniques and over-the-counter painkillers. \n The pain usually improves within a few weeks, but the swelling may take longer to completely disappear. \n Exactly how long it takes to recover may depend on where the bursitis is and whether it is caused by an infection (septic busitis). \n Self-care \n There are a number of things you can\u00a0do yourself\u00a0to reduce the swelling in the affected joint. Rest the joint until your symptoms improve and avoid strenuous activities that are likely to cause additional pain, such as running. \n Wearing padding may help protect the joint from further injury. For example, knee pads may help if you have bursitis in your knee joints. \n Ice packs are also a good way of reducing inflammation and pain. Wrap an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables) in a towel and apply it\u00a0to the affected area for 10-20 minutes. Repeat this every few hours. \n While sleeping, avoid lying on the side that has bursitis. If possible, raising the body part above the level of your heart may help reduce the inflammation. For example, you can prop your foot up on a pillow to raise your ankle.\u00a0 \n If your knees, ankles or hips are affected, try to avoid long periods of standing up. Standing on a soft surface can help, as can placing a pillow between your knees when lying on your side. Being overweight can also cause bursitis, so losing weight may help. \n Painkillers such as\u00a0aspirin,  paracetamol \u00a0or  ibuprofen  can help to relieve the pain. Ibuprofen, or other  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  such as naproxen or diclofenac, can also be used to help reduce swelling. \n Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to check that it is\u00a0suitable for you and that you are taking the correct dose. \n Aspiration \n If the swelling caused by bursitis is particularly severe, you\u00a0may want to consider having the fluid drained out. This procedure, known as aspiration,\u00a0can relieve the\u00a0pain and improve the range of movement in your joint. \n During aspiration, a needle is used to draw out the fluid before the area is covered\u00a0with a dressing. You'll need to avoid strenuous activity for about two days afterwards. \n Corticosteroids \n If your\u00a0 bursitis\u00a0symptoms  are severe or they do not respond to treatment,  corticosteroid injections  are another possible treatment option. Corticosteroids contain steroids, a type of hormone, and can be used to reduce inflammation. \n Your GP can inject corticosteroids directly into the affected area. Possible side effects include the surrounding tissue wasting away and discolouration of the skin around the injection site.\u00a0 \n You will not be able to have a corticosteroid injection if you have septic bursitis, and cannot have\u00a0more than three corticosteroid injections a year in the same area. \n Antibiotics \n Your GP will prescribe  antibiotics \u00a0if tests confirm that\u00a0you have septic\u00a0bursitis. These may include: \n \n flucloxacillin\u00a0 \n erythromycin\u00a0 \n clarithromycin\u00a0 \n \n These will usually be taken as tablets or capsules two or four times a day for seven days. After seven days, your GP should check how well you're responding to the antibiotics. If you still have signs of infection, you may need to take antibiotics for another seven days. \n If you're\u00a0prescribed antibiotics, it's important that you finish the entire course, even if your symptoms improve. This will help to prevent the infection returning. \n Referral \n If your symptoms do not\u00a0improve with treatment\u00a0after a couple of months, your GP may refer you to a specialist. This may be: \n \n a rheumatologist \u2013 a specialist in conditions that affect the bones, muscles and joints \n an orthopaedic surgeon \u2013 a specialist in the surgical treatment of conditions that affect the bones, muscles and joints \n \n You may also be referred if you have infected bursitis that does not get better or reoccurs. \n Surgery \n In some cases, surgery may be recommended\u00a0to remove the affected bursa,\u00a0particularly where\u00a0septic bursitis does not respond to antibiotics. \n Surgery either involves removing the bursa completely, or making an incision in your skin and draining the fluid out of the bursa (incision and drainage).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will usually be able to diagnose bursitis by examining the affected body part and asking about your symptoms. \n You may be asked\u00a0whether you have recently fallen on the\u00a0joint, or whether you have a job or hobby that involves repetitively using the affected area of your body. \n Fluid sample \n If you have a fever\u00a0\u2013 a temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above\u00a0\u2013 you may have a small sample of fluid taken\u00a0from the affected bursa. \n The fluid\u00a0is removed using a needle during\u00a0a procedure known as aspiration. The sample\u00a0is then sent to a laboratory to be tested for bacteria, which\u00a0indicates a\u00a0bacterial infection (septic bursitis). The sample may also be checked for crystals, which can develop\u00a0because of\u00a0conditions such as  gout .\u00a0 \n Following aspiration, a dressing\u00a0is placed over the area and you will need to avoid strenuous activity for a couple of days. \n Further testing \n Further tests\u00a0are usually only required if your symptoms do not respond to treatment. If this is the case, it will be necessary to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for your symptoms. \n Further tests may include: \n \n  blood tests \u00a0\u2013 to rule out conditions such as  rheumatoid arthritis  \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \u00a0\u2013 to rule out tissue damage, such as a torn tendon (tendons are the cords that join bones to muscles)"},

Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also\u00a0get breast cancer. \n If it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body. \n The breasts \n The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed. \n The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. \n Read more about the  causes of breast cancer  \n Symptoms of breast cancer \n Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue. \n Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also see your GP if you notice any of the following: \n \n a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts \n discharge from either of your nipples\u00a0(which may be streaked with blood) \n a lump or swelling in either of your armpits \n dimpling on the skin of your breasts \n a rash on or around your nipple \n a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast \n \n Breast pain isn't usually a symptom of breast cancer. \n Learn more about the  symptoms of breast cancer  \n After examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests.\u00a0This might include a mammography (breast screening)\u00a0or a  biopsy . \n Read more about\u00a0 breast screening \u00a0and\u00a0 how breast cancer is diagnosed  \n Types of breast cancer \n There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types. \n Non-invasive breast cancer \n Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast. \n This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). \n Invasive breast cancer \n Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread. \n The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all\u00a0breast cancer cases and is sometimes called \"no special type\". \n Other types of breast cancer \n Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and  Paget's disease of the breast . \n It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it's known as \"secondary\" or \"metastatic\" breast cancer. \n Breast cancer screening \n About\u00a0one in eight\u00a0women are diagnosed with\u00a0breast cancer during their lifetime. There's a good chance of recovery if it's detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP. \n Mammographic screening (where  X-ray  images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery. \n Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition. \n As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50-70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every three years. \n Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit. \n The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73. \n Read more about\u00a0 breast screening  and  find breast cancer screening services near you  \n Treating breast cancer \n If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body. \n Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery,  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy . Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. \n The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you. \n Read a document listing the one-year net survival estimates by CCG for breast cancer \n In a\u00a0small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is\u00a0to achieve remission (symptom relief). \n Read more about  treating breast cancer  \n Preventing breast cancer \n As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether. \n If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk. \n Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a  healthy weight ,  exercise regularly  and who have a low intake of saturated\u00a0 fat  and  alcohol . \n It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer. \n Read more about  preventing breast cancer  \n Living with breast cancer \n Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways,\u00a0depending on what stage\u00a0it's at and what treatment you're having. \n How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person.

Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment. \n Secondary breast cancer \n Most breast cancers are discovered in the condition's early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it's spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis). \n If this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called \"advanced\" or \"metastatic\" cancer, isn't curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full). \n Want to know more? \n \n Breast Cancer Now:\u00a0 Controlling secondary breast cancer  \n Breast Cancer Care:  Secondary breast cancer  \n \n Surgery \n There are two main types of breast cancer surgery. They are: \n \n surgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery \n surgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a  mastectomy  \n \n In many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed. \n Studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer. \n Breast-conserving surgery \n Breast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where\u00a0just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where\u00a0up to a quarter of the breast is removed. \n If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on: \n \n the type of cancer you have\u00a0 \n the size of the tumour and where it is in your breast \n the amount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed \n the size of your breasts \n \n Your surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. If there's no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there's less chance that the cancer will reoccur. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast. \n After having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells. \n Mastectomy \n A mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy (see below). \n If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm). \n Reconstruction \n Breast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast. \n Lymph node surgery \n To find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy\u00a0may be carried out. \n The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They're part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they're identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye. \n The sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread. \n If there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Predict : Decide on the ideal course of treatment following breast cancer surgery \n Cancer Research UK:  Types of breast cancer surgery  \n Breast Cancer Care:  Breast reconstruction: an animated guide  \n \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It's usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. \n If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. You'll probably have radiotherapy sessions three to five days a week, for\u00a0three to six weeks. Each session will only last a few minutes. \n The type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. The types available are:\u00a0 \n \n breast radiotherapy \u2013 after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue \n chest wall radiotherapy \u2013 after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall \n breast boost \u2013 some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis) \n radiotherapy to the lymph nodes \u2013 where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes \n \n The side effects of radiotherapy include: \n \n irritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n lymphoedema\u00a0(excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm) \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Macmillan:  Radiotherapy for breast cancer\u00a0in women  \n \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. It's usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven't been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. \n In some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. \n Several different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it's spread. \n Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means\u00a0you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. The medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein. \n In some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every\u00a0two to three weeks, over a period of four to eight months, to give your body a rest in between treatments. \n The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. Side effects include: \n \n infections \n loss of appetite \n nausea and vomiting \n tiredness \n  hair loss  \n sore mouth \n \n Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe. \n Chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers. \n If you haven't experienced the menopause, your  periods  may\u00a0stop while you're undergoing chemotherapy treatment. After you've finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again. \n However, this doesn't always happen and you may enter an  early menopause . This is more likely in women over 40 years old, because\u00a0they're closer to menopausal age. Your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility. \n  Chemotherapy for secondary breast cancer  \n If your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won't cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life. \n Want to know more? \n \n Macmillan:  Chemotherapy for breast cancer in women  \n \n Hormone treatment \n Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body. \n These types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects. \n The type of hormone therapy you'll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it's sensitive to, your age, whether you've experienced\u00a0the menopause and what other type of treatment you're having. \n You'll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it's sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove. \n Hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. \n In most cases, you'll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after\u00a0having surgery. If your breast cancer isn't sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect. \n Tamoxifen \n Tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It's taken every day as a tablet or liquid. It can cause several side effects, including: \n \n tiredness \n changes to your periods \n nausea and vomiting \n hot flushes \n aching joints \n  headaches \u00a0 \n weight gain \n \n Aromatase inhibitors \n If you've\u00a0experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries. \n Three aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are\u00a0anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day. Side effects include: \n \n hot flushes and sweats \n  lack of interest in sex (loss of libido)  \n nausea and vomiting \n tiredness \n aching joints and bone pain \n headaches \n skin rashes \n \n Ovarian ablation or suppression \n In women who haven't\u00a0experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen. \n Ablation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It\u00a0stops the ovaries working permanently and means you'll experience the menopause early. \n Ovarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa). Your periods will stop while you're taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete. \n If you're\u00a0approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin. \n Goserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including: \n \n hot flushes and sweats \n mood swings \n trouble sleeping \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Breast Cancer Care:  Hormone therapy  \n \n Biological therapy (targeted therapy) \n Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive. Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells. \n If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you'll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin,\u00a0is usually used after chemotherapy. \n Trastuzumab \n Trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive. \n Trastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It's also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection). \n You will have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer. On average, you'll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced. \n Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it's not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as  angina , uncontrolled\u00a0 high blood pressure (hypertension)  or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you'll have\u00a0regular tests on your heart to make sure it's not causing any problems. \n Other side effects of trastuzumab may include: \n \n an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which\u00a0can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever \n diarrhoea \n tiredness \n aches and pains \n \n Clinical trials \n A great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment. \n These advances were discovered in  clinical trials , where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones. \n All cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they're worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those\u00a0in routine care. \n If you're asked to take part in a trial, you'll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you'll be asked to sign a\u00a0 consent  form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care. \n Want to know more? \n \n Breast Cancer Care:  Clinical trials  \n Against Breast Cancer:\u00a0 Our research  \n \n Psychological help \n Dealing with cancer can be a huge challenge, for both patients and their families. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties. Many women have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting. \n It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. \n There are various ways to find help and support. Your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor. If you're feeling depressed, talk to your GP. A course of antidepressant drugs may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist. \n It can help to talk to someone who's been through the same thing as you. Many organisations have helplines and online forums. They can also put you in touch with other people who've had cancer treatment. \n Want to know more? \n \n Breast Cancer Care:  Someone to talk to  \n Macmillan Cancer Support:\u00a0 Online community  \n \n Complementary therapies \n Complementary therapies are holistic therapies that can promote physical and emotional wellbeing. They're given alongside conventional treatments and include  relaxation techniques , massage, aromatherapy and acupuncture. \n Complementary therapy\u00a0can help some women cope with diagnosis and treatment, and provide\u00a0a break\u00a0from the treatment plan. \n Your hospital or breast unit may be able to provide access to complementary therapies or suggest where you can\u00a0get them. It's important to speak to your breast cancer specialist nurse about any complementary therapy you wish to use, to make sure it doesn't\u00a0interfere with your conventional treatment. \n Want to know more? \n \n Breast Cancer Care:  Complementary therapies", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Tests at the breast cancer clinic \n If you have suspected breast cancer, either\u00a0because of\u00a0your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you'll be referred to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. \n Mammogram and breast ultrasound \n If you have symptoms and have been referred by your GP, you'll have a mammogram to produce an\u00a0 X-ray  of your breasts. You may also need an  ultrasound scan . \n If your cancer was detected through the NHS Breast Screening Programme, you may need another mammogram or ultrasound scan. \n If you're under 35 years of age, your doctor may suggest that you only have a breast ultrasound scan. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn't as effective as ultrasound in\u00a0detecting cancer. \n Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid. \n Read more about  breast screening  \n Biopsy \n A\u00a0 biopsy  is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it's cancerous. You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected. \n Biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition.\u00a0Different methods of\u00a0carrying out\u00a0a biopsy are discussed below. \n Needle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue. \n Needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. You'll have a  local anaesthetic , which means you'll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb. \n Your doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy (usually guided by ultrasound or X-ray, but sometimes MRI is used) to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer and to distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). \n Vacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. During the procedure, a needle\u00a0is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to\u00a0obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area. \n  Want to know more?  \n \n Breast Cancer Care:\u00a0 Referral to a breast clinic  \n Breast Cancer Care:  Your pathology report  \n Macmillan:  How breast cancer in women\u00a0is diagnosed  \n \n Further tests for breast cancer \n If a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment. \n Scans and X-rays \n  Computerised tomography (CT) scans , or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast. \n If your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. This will be absorbed into your bone if it's been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera. \n Tests to determine specific types of treatment \n You'll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment. The results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it. The types of test you could be offered are discussed below. \n In some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone. \n If this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as \"hormone therapy\". \n During\u00a0a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they're known as \"hormone receptor positive\". \n While hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called\u00a0human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). \n These types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as \"biological\" or \"targeted\" therapy. \n \u00a0 \n Stage and grade of breast cancer \n Stage of breast cancer \n When your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. \n Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as Stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer (see below). \n \n Stage 1 \u2013 the tumour measures less than 2cm and the lymph nodes in the armpit aren't affected. There are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body. \n Stage 2 \u2013 the tumour measures 2-5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both. There are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body. \n Stage 3 \u2013 the tumour measures\u00a02-5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues. The lymph nodes in the armpit are affected. However, there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body. \n Stage 4 \u2013 the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). \n \n This is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you're not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor. \n TNM staging system \n The TNM staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. \n Grade of breast cancer \n The grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells. \n \n Low grade (G1) \u2013 the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly. \n Medium grade (G2) \u2013 the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells. \n High grade (G3) \u2013 the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quickly. \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  TNM breast cancer staging  \n Cancer Research UK:  Number stages of breast cancer"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bulimia", "introduction": "Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder and mental health condition. \n People who have bulimia try to control their weight by severely restricting the amount of food they eat, then\u00a0 binge eating  and purging the food from their body by making themselves vomit or using  laxatives .\u00a0 \n As with other eating disorders, bulimia\u00a0nervosa can be associated with: \n \n low self-esteem \n  alcohol misuse  \n  depression  \n self-harm \n \n Learn more about the  causes of bulimia nervosa  \n Binge eating and purging \n Eating disorders are often associated with an abnormal attitude towards food or body image. \n Everyone has their own eating habits \u2013 for example, people with a food intolerance need to avoid eating certain foods to stay healthy. However, people suffering from eating disorders tend to use their eating habits and behaviours to cope with emotional distress, and often have an abnormal or unrealistic fear of food, calories and being fat. \n Because of this fear, people with bulimia nervosa tend to restrict their food intake. This results in periods of excessive eating and loss of control (binge eating),\u00a0after which they make themselves\u00a0vomit or use laxatives (purging). They purge themselves because they fear that the binging\u00a0will cause them to gain weight, and usually feel guilty and ashamed of their behaviour. This is why these behaviours are usually done in secret. \n Such binge-purge cycles can be triggered by hunger or stress, or are a way to cope with emotional anxiety. \n Warning signs \n Signs of bulimia nervosa include an obsessive attitude towards food and eating, an overcritical attitude to their weight and shape, and frequent visits to the bathroom after eating, after which the person might appear flushed and have scarred knuckles\u00a0(from forcing fingers down the throat to bring on vomiting). \n Read more about the  symptoms and warning signs of bulimia  \n Bulimia can eventually lead to physical problems associated with poor nutrient intake, excessive vomiting or overuse of laxatives. \n Read more about these  complications of bulimia  \n Who is affected by bulimia nervosa? \n As with all eating disorders, women are\u00a0much more likely to develop bulimia than men. \n However, bulimia nervosa is becoming increasingly common in boys and men. There are an estimated\u00a01.6 million Britons suffering from some form of eating disorder,\u00a0and reports estimate that up to 25% may be male. \n Recent studies suggest that as many as 8% of women have bulimia at some stage in their life. The condition can occur at any age, but mainly affects women aged between 16 and 40 (on average, it starts around the age of 18 or 19). \n Bulimia nervosa can affect children, but this is extremely rare.\u00a0 \n What to do \n If you have an eating disorder such as bulimia, the first step is to recognise that you have a problem. Then, you need to visit your GP for a medical check-up and advice on how to get treatment. \n If you think someone you know has bulimia nervosa, talk to them and try to persuade them to see their GP. \n There are also many support groups and charities you can approach for help, including: \n \n  beat:\u00a0beating eating\u00a0disorders  \n  Mental Health Foundation \u00a0 \n  Anorexia and Bulimia Care  \n  MGEDT: Men Get Eating Disorders Too  \n \n Read about  diagnosing bulimia  \n The first step towards getting better is to recognise the problem and to have a genuine desire to get well. \n There is strong evidence that self-help books can be effective for many people with bulimia nervosa, especially if they ask a friend or family member to work through it with them. \n If this is not suitable or is unsuccessful, your GP can refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service, where you may be offered a structured programme of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Some people may also benefit from antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), as this can reduce the urges to binge and vomit. \n Read more about the  treatment of bulimia", "symptoms": "The main signs of bulimia are binge eating and purging (ridding your body of food by making yourself vomit or taking laxatives). \n There may also be psychological symptoms, such as: \n \n an obsessive attitude towards food and eating \n unrealistic opinions about body weight and shape \n  depression  and anxiety \n isolation \u2013 losing interest in other people \n \n Without treatment, bulimia can lead to a number of physical complications. Read more about  complications of bulimia . \n Binge eating \n Binge eating is repeatedly eating vast quantities of high-calorie food, without necessarily feeling hungry or needing to eat. The urge to eat can begin as an attempt to deal with emotional problems, but can quickly become obsessive and out of control. \n Binge eating is usually a very quick process and you may feel physically uncomfortable afterwards. When binge eating is\u00a0a symptom of bulimia, it\u00a0happens regularly, not just once or twice. \n Binge eating episodes\u00a0are sometimes spontaneous, where you eat anything you can find. They can also\u00a0be planned, where you make a shopping trip to buy foods specifically to binge on. \n Read more information about\u00a0 binge eating . \n Purging \n Purging is a response to binging. After you have eaten lots of food in a short space of time, you may feel physically bloated and unattractive. You may also feel guilty, regretful and full of self-hatred. \n However, the main impulse to purge is a powerful, overriding fear of putting on weight. \n The most common methods of purging involve making yourself\u00a0vomit or using\u00a0 laxatives  to encourage your body to pass the food quickly. \n Less common methods of purging include taking diet pills, over-exercising, extreme dieting, periods of starvation or taking illegal drugs, such as amphetamines. \n Cycle of guilt \n Bulimia is often a vicious circle. If you have the condition, it is likely that you have very low self-esteem. You may also think you are overweight, even though you may be at or near a normal weight for your height and build. \n This may encourage you to set yourself strict rules about dieting, eating or exercising, which are very hard to maintain. If you fail to keep to these strict rules, you binge on the things that you have denied yourself. After feeling guilty about binging, you purge to get rid of the calories.", "causes": "There is no simple answer to the question of what causes bulimia. Although the condition is linked to a fear of getting fat, more complex emotions usually contribute. \n The act of binging and purging is often a way of dealing with these intense emotions. \n Common emotional causes \n Common problems that may lead to bulimia include: \n \n low self-esteem \u2013 if you have an eating disorder, you may have a low opinion of yourself and see losing weight as a way of gaining self-worth \n  depression  \u2013 you may use binging as a way of coping with unhappiness,\u00a0but purging does not relieve this depression and the cycle continues \n stress \u2013 for example, you may develop the condition after dealing with a traumatic experience, such as a death or divorce, or during the course of important life-changing events, such as getting married or leaving home \n \n Bulimia can also occur in people who have experienced physical illness, and in people who have been sexually abused. Some people with bulimia have experienced a difficult childhood, with family problems, arguments and criticism. \n Other mental health problems \n Bulimia is often linked to other psychological problems. Research shows that bulimia is more common in people who have: \n \n  anxiety disorders  \n  obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  \n  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  \n  personality disorders  \n \n Cultural and social pressure \n Some people believe that the media and fashion industries create pressure for people to aspire to low body weights. \n Puberty \n Many young people become affected by eating disorders around the time of puberty, when hormonal changes can make them more aware of their body. \n If teenagers feel they have no say in their lives, bulimia can seem like the only way to take control. \n Genetics \n There may be a genetic factor related to developing bulimia. Research suggests that people who have a close relative who has or has had bulimia are four times more likely to develop it than those who do not have a relative with the condition. \n Men and bulimia \n The causes of bulimia in men can be slightly different. In many cases, bulimia develops because of bodybuilding or specific occupations like athletics, dancing or horse racing. \n However, like many women, younger men are increasingly becoming more vulnerable to disliking their bodies and being bullied or teased as children for being overweight.", "treatment": "You can recover from bulimia, but it may be a long and difficult process. The first step towards getting better is to recognise the problem and have a genuine desire to get well. This may involve a big change in lifestyle and circumstances. \n If you are concerned about a friend or family member, it can be difficult to know what to do. It is common for someone with an eating disorder to be secretive and defensive about their eating and their weight, and they will probably deny being unwell. \n You can talk in confidence to an adviser from eating disorders charity\u00a0 Beat  by calling their helpline on 0845 634 1414. They also have a designated youth helpline, on 0845 634 7650. \n Treatment usually begins with psychological therapy, which aims to help re-establish healthy attitudes towards eating. People with bulimia need to explore and understand the underlying issues and feelings that are contributing to their eating disorder, and change their attitudes to food and weight.\u00a0 \n Your GP may suggest medication, usually in addition to psychological treatment. \n Psychological treatment \n Cognitive behavioural therapy \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0is the most common type of psychological treatment for bulimia. It involves talking to a therapist and looking at your emotions in detail to work out new ways of thinking about situations, feelings and food. It may also involve keeping a food diary, which will help determine what triggers your binge eating. \n Interpersonal therapy \n As with CBT, interpersonal therapy (IPT) involves meeting with a therapist to discuss your condition. However, the focus is more on your personal relationships than your problems with food. \n You are more likely to be referred for this type of psychological treatment if you have recently lost a loved one\u00a0or have experienced a big change in your life. The aim of IPT is to help you establish supportive relationships, which can draw your focus away from eating. \n Medication \n  Antidepressants \u00a0known as  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) may be used to treat bulimia. The SSRI usually recommended to treat bulimia is called\u00a0fluoxetine (brand name Prozac). \n SSRIs are mainly used to treat depression, but are also used to treat: \n \n eating disorders \n  obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)  \n anxiety \n social phobia \n \n As with any antidepressant, an SSRI will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You will usually be started on a low dose, which is then gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medicine. \n When you start taking an SSRI, see your GP after two, four, six and\u00a0twelve weeks to check your progress and to see if you are responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important that your progress is carefully monitored. \n Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It is also best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease. \n Hospital treatment \n Bulimia is not usually treated in hospital. However, if you have serious health complications and your life is at risk, you may be admitted to hospital. Hospital treatment is also considered if you are at risk of  suicide  or self-harm. \n The recovery process \n Once diagnosed, people with bulimia can recover, but it may take a long time. It can be very difficult, both for the person affected and their family and friends. \n To recover, someone with bulimia needs to: \n \n change their eating habits \n change the way they think about food \n gain weight safely, if necessary \n \n The longer someone has had bulimia, the harder it is to re-learn healthy eating habits and gain weight. It is important to start treatment as early as possible, so the person has the best chance of recovery. \n For most people, recovery goes through several stages, with progress seeming to go backwards and forwards.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have an eating disorder such as bulimia, the first step is to recognise that you have a problem and visit your GP. You may think it is not serious, but bulimia can damage your long-term health. \n Accepting that you need help and support is the first step to recovery, but this may be a very difficult step for you to take. Most people who have bulimia hide their situation for months or years before seeking help. It can often take a change of situation, such as the start of a new relationship or living with new people, to make a person with bulimia want to seek help. \n It may help to make a list of questions you want to ask before you see your GP.\u00a0Once you have explained your situation to your GP, they will decide whether to refer you to a specialist mental health team. \n Your local team will include: \n \n specialist counsellors \n psychiatrists \n psychologists \n nurses \n dietitians \n other healthcare professionals \n \n Your treatment depends on how serious your condition is and the best way to manage it. Your GP may recommend a self-help programme to start your recovery before referring you for specialist treatment. \n You can make a full recovery from bulimia. The earlier you start treatment, the quicker the recovery process will be. \n Do I have an eating disorder? \n Doctors sometimes use a questionnaire called the SCOFF questionnaire to help recognise people who may have an eating disorder. This involves answering the following five questions: \n \n Scoff: Do you ever make yourself\u00a0vomit because you feel uncomfortably full? \n Control: Do you worry you have lost control over how much you eat? \n One stone: Have you recently lost more than one stone (six kilograms) in a three-month period? \n Fat: Do you believe yourself to be fat when others say you are too thin? \n Food: Would you say that food dominates your life? \n \n If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to two or more of these questions, you may have an eating disorder."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Brain stem death", "introduction": "Brain stem death is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe. \n When this happens, a\u00a0ventilator keeps the person's heart beating and oxygen circulating through their bloodstream. \n A person is confirmed as being dead when their brain stem function is permanently lost. \n Confirming death \n Confirming death used to be straightforward. Death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. The lack of oxygen, which occurred as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function. \n Confirming death is now more complex, because it's possible to keep the heart beating after the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning. This can be done by keeping a person on a ventilator, which allows the body and\u00a0heart to be artificially oxygenated. However, that person won't ever regain consciousness or start breathing again. \n Once the brain stem has permanently stopped functioning, there's no way of reversing it and the heart will eventually stop beating, even if a ventilator continues to be used. \n To save a person's family and friends from unnecessary suffering, once there's clear evidence that brain death has occurred, the person will be disconnected from the\u00a0ventilator. \n The brain stem \n The brain stem is the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column). \n The brain stem is responsible for regulating most of the body's automatic functions that are essential for life. These include: \n \n breathing \n heartbeat \n blood pressure \n swallowing \n \n The brain stem also relays information to and from the brain to the rest of the body, so it plays an important role in the brain\u2019s core functions, such as consciousness, awareness and movement. \n After\u00a0brain death, it's not possible for someone to remain conscious. \n How brain death occurs \n Brain death can occur when the blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by: \n \n cardiac arrest \u2013 when the heart stops beating and the brain is starved of oxygen \n  heart attack  \u2013 a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked \n  stroke  \u2013 a serious medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is blocked or interrupted \n blood clot \u2013 a blockage in a blood vessel that disturbs or blocks the flow of blood around your body \n \n Brain death can also occur as a result of: \n \n a\u00a0 severe head injury  \n a brain haemorrhage \n infections, such as encephalitis \n a\u00a0 brain tumour \u00a0 \n \n Vegetative state \n There's a difference between brain death and a\u00a0vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage. \n Someone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness \u2013 for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings. \n In rare cases, a person may demonstrate some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings. \n However, the important difference between brain death and a vegetative state is that someone in a vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem, which means that: \n \n some form of consciousness may exist \n breathing unaided is usually possible\u00a0 \n there's a slim chance of recovery, because the brain stem's core functions may be unaffected \n \n A\u00a0person who is brain dead has no chance of recovery, because their body is unable to survive without artificial support. \n Confirming brain death \n Although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead. \n These include drug overdoses (particularly from barbiturates) and severe\u00a0hypothermia (where body temperature drops below 28C). \n Therefore, a number of tests are carried out to check that brain death has actually occurred, such as shining a torch into both eyes to see if they react to the light. \n Organ donation \n After brain death has occurred,\u00a0it may be possible for the person's organs to be used in transplantations, which can often save the lives of others. \n In cases where a deceased person hasn't made their wishes clear, deciding whether to donate their organs can be a difficult decision for partners and relatives. Hospital staff are aware of these difficulties and will try to ensure\u00a0the issue is handled sensitively and thoughtfully. \n Read more about  organ donation", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "There are a number of criteria for diagnosing brain stem death. \n For a diagnosis of brain stem death to be made: \n \n a\u00a0person must be unconscious and fail to respond to outside stimulation \n a\u00a0person's heartbeat and breathing can only be maintained using a ventilator \n there must be clear evidence that serious brain damage has occurred and it can't be cured \n \n Ruling out other conditions \n Before testing for brain stem death can begin, doctors must carry out a series of checks to ensure that the symptoms aren't being caused by other factors, such as: \n \n an overdose of illegal drugs, tranquillisers, poisons or other chemical agents \n an abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia) \n severe under-activity of the thyroid gland \n \n Once these factors have been ruled out, tests are carried out to confirm brain death. The diagnosis of brain death has to be made by two senior doctors. Neither of them can be involved with the hospital's transplant team. \n The doctors will explain the tests to you and they'll keep you informed about your loved one's condition at all times. \n Tests \n The doctors will run a series of tests. Both doctors have to agree on the results for a diagnosis of brain death to be confirmed. The tests are carried out twice to minimise any chance of error. \n The tests used to determine whether brain stem death has occurred are outlined below: \n \n A torch is shone into both eyes to see if they react to the light. \n The cornea (transparent outer layer of the eye), which is usually very sensitive, is stroked with a tissue or piece of cotton wool to see if the eye\u00a0reacts. \n Pressure is applied to the forehead and the nose is pinched to see if there's any movement in response. \n Ice-cold water is inserted into each ear, which would usually cause the eyes to move. \n A thin, plastic tube is placed down the trachea (windpipe) to see if it\u00a0provokes gagging or coughing. \n The person is disconnected from the ventilator for a short period of time to see if they make any attempt to breathe on their own. \n \n Brain death will be\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0if a person fails to respond to all of these tests. \n Occasionally, a person\u2019s limbs or torso (the upper part of the body) may move, even after brain stem death has been diagnosed. \n These spinal reflex movements are generated by the spinal cord and don't involve the brain at all. Therefore, they won't affect the diagnosis of brain death."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bowel polyps", "introduction": "Bowel polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon (large bowel) or rectum. They are common, affecting 15-20% of the UK population, and don't usually cause symptoms. \n Polyps are usually less than 1cm in size, although they can grow up to several centimetres. There are various forms: \n \n some are a tiny raised area or bulge, known as\u00a0a sessile polyp \n some\u00a0look like a grape on a stalk, known as a pedunculated polyp \n some take the form of many tiny bumps clustered together \n \n Bowel polyps\u00a0are not usually cancerous, although\u00a0if they're discovered they'll need to be removed, as some will eventually turn into cancer if left untreated. \n Some people just develop one polyp, while others may have a few.\u00a0They tend to occur in people over the age of 60. \n How are they caused? \n Bowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly. \n There may be a family tendency towards developing bowel polyps or bowel cancer. \n What are the symptoms? \n Most people with polyps won't be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident. \n However, some larger polyps can cause: \n \n a small amount of rectal bleeding\u00a0(blood in your stool) \n mucus to be produced when you open your bowels \n  diarrhoea \u00a0or  constipation  \n  abdominal pain  \n \n How are they discovered? \n Bowel polyps\u00a0are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during  screening for bowel cancer . \n If polyps are found, a colonoscopy or CT colonography\u00a0is needed to view the whole of the large bowel and remove any polyps. \n How are they treated? \n There are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp\u00a0during a colonoscopy. Snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless. \n Both of the above methods involve passing a flexible instrument called a colonoscope through your bottom and\u00a0up into your bowel. The colonoscope has a wire with an electric current to either cauterise (burn off) or snare the polyp. \n In rare cases, polyps may need to be treated by surgically removing part of the bowel. This is usually only done when the polyp has some cell changes or is particularly large. \n After the polyp or polyps have been removed, they are sent to specialists in a laboratory, who will inform your consultant if: \n \n the polyp has been completely removed \n there is any risk of it regrowing \n there is any cancerous change in the polyp \n \n If there is a cancerous change in the polyp, you may need further treatment (depending on the degree and extent of change). Your specialist will be able to advise you on this. \n Outlook \n Some people will need further colonoscopies because polyps can recur. Polyps can sometimes run in families. This is uncommon, but\u00a0means you'll need colonoscopy checks at regular intervals. \n You might be asked to have repeat examinations at intervals of around 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0years to catch any further polyps that may develop and potentially turn into bowel cancer.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Brain tumours: Children", "introduction": "Brain tumours are the most common tumours that develop in children. Children of any age may be affected. About 400 children in the UK develop brain tumours each year. Boys are affected slightly more often than girls. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation.\u00a0 \n Brain tumours \n A tumour in the brain can come from the brain itself (primary), or from another part of the body (secondary). This information is about primary brain tumours. \n Signs and symptoms \n These will depend on the size of the tumour, where it is and how it affects that part of the brain. Most commonly, children present with symptoms described below. These are caused by the pressure inside the head being higher than it should be: a growing tumour may push normal brain out of the way, or block the flow of fluid in the brain. Doctors call this raised intracranial pressure, and it can cause symptoms such as: \n \n  headaches  (often worse in the morning) \n vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick \n fits (seizures) \n feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things \n eye problems, such as abnormal eye movements, blurring or double vision feeling very tired much more quickly than usual \n feeling extremely sleepy (drowsy) for no reason \n \n Brain tumours can also cause problems with balance and walking, weakness down one side of the body, or changes in behaviour. Some of these symptoms are common even without a brain tumour, and this can cause confusion in the early stages. \n The brain \n The brain is contained within the skull, which protects it. Between the brain and the skull, there are three layers of membrane called the meninges. These completely cover the brain and spinal cord and help to protect it. Between two of these layers is a space that contains a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates around the brain and spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u00a0The main parts of the brain are: \n \n the cerebrum - this is at the top of the head and is the largest part of the brain. It is made up of two halves or hemispheres. It controls thinking, learning, memory, problem solving, emotions and touch. It also helps us be aware of our body position \n the cerebellum - this is the back part of the brain, and it controls movement, balance and coordination \n the brain stem - this connects the brain to the spinal cord and is in the lower part of the brain just above the back of the neck. It controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, eye movements and swallowing \n \n What happens when a brain tumour is suspected \n Knowing what a test involves can make things a bit easier. The specialist doctor and nurse will explain things but don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions. \n Your doctor will want to hear about the problems your child has had recently, and will examine him or her properly. This will include looking into the back of your child\u2019s eyes with an ophthalmoscope to check for swelling, which can be a sign of raised pressure in the brain. They\u2019ll usually check other things like balance, coordination, sensation and reflexes. \n  CT or MRI scan  \n Most children will have a  CT  or an  MRI scan , which looks in detail at the inside of the brain. \n A CT scan uses  X-rays . It is quick and often is the best first-line investigation, but it does not give as detailed pictures as an MRI. It uses quite a lot of X-rays, and so it is important to make sure we do not use it on too many people if it can be avoided. \n An MRI scan uses no X-rays, and gives more detailed pictures, but takes much longer. Machines are noisy, and often children cannot lie still long enough to get proper images. It is sometimes necessary to have an anaesthetic for this scan. \n Ordinary X-rays are not usually helpful for brain tumours. \n  Blood tests  \n These are usually done to make sure it is safe to do an operation, and can also be used to help diagnose certain types of tumour. \n  Biopsy  \n It is often necessary for doctors to remove a small part of the tumour (biopsy) to find out exactly what type of tumour it is. It means your child will need to go into hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic. The piece of tumour removed is then examined under a microscope by an specialist doctor called a pathologist. \n A biopsy isn\u2019t always done; it is sometimes better to remove the whole tumour in one operation. In this case, it will be a few days before the exact type of tumour is known. \n Sometimes, it may be safer to do the operation in two stages. Part of the tumour might be removed in the first operation and the rest a few days later. \n Types of brain tumours \n There are different types of brain tumours and they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. The main types are astrocytoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, but there are many other, less common types. \n Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). \n  Benign brain tumours  \n These remain in the part of the brain that they started in and do not usually spread into other areas. Sometimes it may be difficult to remove a benign tumour, because of where it is and, in this situation, other treatments may be needed. \n The most common tumour of this type is a low grade astrocytoma (also called low grade glioma). \n  Malignant primary brain tumours  \n These are most likely to cause problems by causing pressure and damage to the areas around them and possibly by spreading to the normal brain tissue close by. \n The main types that affect children are: \n  High grade astrocytoma and ependymoma  \n These tumours develop from the supporting cells of the brain known as glial cells, and are sometimes also called gliomas. \n  Medulloblastomas  \n These usually develop in the lower part of the brain, the cerebellum. They may spread to other parts of the brain or into the spinal cord, and treatment must include the whole of this. \n Treatment \n Because there are different types of brain tumours, treatment will not be the same for everyone. The doctors will look at the type of brain tumour, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment. \n These are the main treatments used to treat brain tumours. Your child may have one treatment or a combination of treatments: \n  Surgery  \n Usually, a neurosurgeon will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Operations can be very long \u2013 it is not uncommon for these to be more than six or eight hours \u2013 so you should not become unduly worried by this. \n Sometimes, the fluid in and around the brain does not flow freely, as a result of the tumour or brain swelling. In this case, it may be necessary to place a fine tube (shunt) to drain excess fluid from the brain and into the lining of the tummy area (abdomen). You cannot see the shunt outside the body. Another way of treating this is to create another drainage route for the fluid around the obstruction (called a ventriculostomy). \n Frontal lobe (thinking, memory, behaviour and movement) Temporal lobe (hearing, learning and feelings) Brain stem (breathing, heart rate and temperature) Cerebellum (balance and coordination) Occipital lobe (sight) Parietal lobe (language and touch) Areas of the brain Illustration reproduced with permission from Macmillan Cancer Support \n After the operation, your child may spend some time in an intensive care ward or high dependency unit, so the nurses and doctors can keep a very close eye on them. \n Once a diagnosis is known, a plan to treat any tumour left behind can be made. For benign tumours, there may be no further treatment, but for some, radiotherapy or chemotherapy will be required. \n  Radiotherapy  \n Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy radiation beams. These are exactly the same as visible light, but instead of reflecting from the surface, the energy passes inside the body, where it causes damage to tumour cells. \n Radiotherapy is delivered extremely carefully, using machines linked to the MRI scans of your child\u2019s brain. The process usually takes a few minutes each time, but often needs to continue for five or six weeks. \n Sometimes more specialised types of radiotherapy may be used. Your child\u2019s oncologist will explain more about this. \n  Chemotherapy  \n Chemotherapy uses drugs to get rid of cancer cells. Chemotherapy is given into the veins, and sometimes as a liquid or tablets by mouth. Treatment is often quite prolonged, with periods of time in hospital and gaps when you will be able to return home. This part of the treatment is planned by an oncologist. \n The specialist doctor and nurse will explain your child\u2019s treatment and answer your questions so that you understand what is involved. \n Other medicines your child may need to take \n Your child may need to take medicines for a while to reduce or control the symptoms of the brain tumour: \n  Steroids  \n These are medicines that reduce swelling and inflammation in the brain and can help with symptoms. \n  Anticonvulsants  \n These are medicines that help prevent fits, which can be a problem before or after operations on the brain. They may only be necessary for a short period, but sometimes are needed for longer. \n Side effects of treatment \n Your child\u2019s doctor and specialist nurse will explain more about what to expect. Always let them know about any side effects your child is having. Many side effects can be well controlled or made easier. \n Some possible common side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy include: \n  Hair loss  \n Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause  hair loss . Your child\u2019s hair will usually grow back again after chemotherapy, although it may not after radiotherapy. \n  Tiredness  \n Tiredness is very common with both treatments and may continue for weeks after chemotherapy or radiotherapy finishes. \n  Feeling sick  \n Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may make your child feel sick. This can usually be controlled well with anti-sickness drugs, which the oncologist will prescribe for your child. \n  Increased risk of an infection  \n Chemotherapy can increase the risk of infection, so it is important to contact the oncologist or specialist nurse straightaway if your child has a temperature, any signs of infection or suddenly feels unwell. \n  Skin changes in the treated area if your child is having radiotherapy  \n Radiotherapy can cause a mild form of sunburn. Skin may become red, flaky or sore if your child has fair skin and may become darker and flaky if your child has dark skin. You\u2019ll be given advice on looking after the skin in the treated area. \n Clinical trials \n Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It is important to realise that a clinical trial is not an \u2018experiment\u2019, and your doctor will always offer you what is believed to be the best available treatment. Clinical trials are usually offered to explore ways of making new improvements to treatment, beyond what is already known. \n Specialist doctors carry out many trials for brain tumours. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it is right for your child. You can also join a trial, and then withdraw if you change your mind at a later date. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group  (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n After treatment is over, your child will be seen regularly by specialists. This is to check their progress and how well they\u2019re recovering from treatment. It is also to check that they don\u2019t have any long-term problems from treatment. \n You can contact your child\u2019s specialist doctor or nurse at any time if you have any worries about their health. \n Long-term side effects \n Sometimes treatments may cause possible long-term side effects that may develop later. Your child\u2019s oncologist or specialist nurse will explain the possible risk of any long-term effects in your child\u2019s situation. Children are monitored for any long-term problems following treatment so that they can be picked up and managed early on. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Brain tumours", "introduction": "A brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way. It can either be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). \n Brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4 according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to\u00a0grow back after treatment.\u00a0 \n \n  Benign brain tumours  are\u00a0low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly\u00a0and are less likely to return after treatment. \n  Malignant brain tumours  are\u00a0high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they're more likely to grow back after treatment. \n \n This page gives general information relevant to both types of brain tumour. The links above will take you to more information about the specific types. \n Symptoms of a brain tumour \n The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that's affected. Common symptoms include: \n \n severe, persistent\u00a0 headaches  \n seizures (fits) \n persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness \n mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality \n progressive weakness or\u00a0paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems \n \n Sometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with or they may only develop very slowly over time. \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you\u00a0have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. \n If your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan. \n Who is affected \n Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. \n More than 9,000 people are diagnosed with primary\u00a0brain tumours in the UK each year, of\u00a0which about half\u00a0are benign and half are malignant. Many others\u00a0are diagnosed\u00a0with secondary brain tumours. \n The exact reason why some people develop primary brain tumours is unknown,\u00a0but it's thought that certain genetic conditions \u2013 such as  neurofibromatosis type 1  and  tuberous sclerosis \u00a0\u2013 and previous  radiotherapy \u00a0to the head increase\u00a0your risk. \n Treatment and outlook \n The main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible. \n It's not always possible to remove the entire tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy and/or  chemotherapy  may be necessary to kill any abnormal cells left behind. \n For most benign tumours, treatment is often\u00a0successful and a full recovery is possible, although there's sometimes a small chance the tumour could come back.\u00a0Regular follow-up appointments will normally be recommended to monitor this. \n The outlook for malignant tumours is generally less good, although this varies depending on things such as\u00a0where the tumour is in the brain, your age, and your general health. Unfortunately,\u00a0a cure is often not possible and most tumours will return after treatment. \n If a tumour does come back, treatment\u00a0will aim to relieve your symptoms and prolong life by controlling the growth of the tumour.\u00a0 \n Support and further information \n As well as reading the separate pages on\u00a0benign brain tumours\u00a0and malignant brain tumours, you may find the following websites useful sources of information and support: \n \n  The Brain Tumour Charity  \n  Brain Tumour Research  \n  Cancer Research UK: brain tumours \u00a0 \n  Macmillan: brain tumours", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Womb (uterus) cancer", "introduction": "Cancer of the womb (uterus) is a common cancer that affects the female reproductive system. It's also called uterine cancer and endometrial cancer. \n Abnormal vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom of womb cancer. \n If you have been through the  menopause , any vaginal bleeding is considered abnormal. If you have not yet been through the menopause, unusual bleeding may include bleeding between your periods. \n You should see your GP as soon as possible if you experience any unusual vaginal bleeding. While it's unlikely\u00a0to be\u00a0caused by womb cancer, it's best to be sure. \n Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. They will refer you to a specialist for further tests if they suspect you may have a serious problem, or if they are unsure about a diagnosis. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of womb cancer  and  diagnosing womb cancer  \n Types of womb cancer \n The vast majority of womb cancers\u00a0begin in the cells that make up the lining of the\u00a0womb (called the endometrium), which is why cancer of the womb\u00a0is often called endometrial cancer. \n In rare cases, womb cancer can start in the muscles surrounding the womb. This type of cancer is called uterine sarcoma and may be treated in a different way from endometrial cancer. \n This article uses the term womb cancer, and\u00a0mostly includes information about endometrial cancer. Read more  information about soft tissue sarcomas . \n Womb cancer is separate\u00a0from other cancers of the female reproductive system, such as\u00a0 ovarian cancer  and  cervical cancer . \n Why does womb cancer happen? \n It's not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition. \n A hormone imbalance is one of the most important risks for womb cancer. Specifically, your risk is increased if you have high levels of a hormone called oestrogen in your body. \n A number of\u00a0things can cause this hormone imbalance, including obesity, diabetes, and\u00a0 hormone replacement therapy (HRT) .\u00a0There is also a small increase in the risk of womb cancer with long-term use of the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. \n It's not always possible to prevent womb cancer, but some things are thought to reduce your risk. This includes maintaining a healthy weight and the long-term use of some types of  contraception . \n Read more about the  causes of womb cancer  \n How is womb cancer treated? \n The most common treatment for womb cancer is the surgical removal of the womb (hysterectomy). \n A hysterectomy can cure womb cancer in its early stages, but\u00a0you\u00a0will no longer be able to get pregnant.\u00a0Surgery for womb cancer is also likely to include the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. \n  Radiotherapy  or\u00a0 chemotherapy \u00a0are also sometimes used, often in conjunction with surgery. \n A type of hormone therapy may be used if you are yet to go through the menopause and would still like to have children. \n Even if your cancer is advanced and the chances of a cure are small, treatment can still help to relieve symptoms and prolong your life. \n Read more about  treating womb cancer  \n Living with womb cancer \n Living with cancer is challenging and womb cancer can affect your life in specific ways. \n For example, your sex life may be affected if you have a hysterectomy. You may find it physically more difficult to have sex and have a reduced sex drive. \n You may find it beneficial to talk to other people about your condition, including family members, your partner, or other people with womb cancer. \n Read more about  living with womb cancer  \n Who is affected? \n Womb cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer of the female reproductive system. It's the fourth most common cancer diagnosed\u00a0in women after  breast cancer ,  lung cancer , and  cancer of the colon and rectum . \n In the UK, about 8,475 new cases of womb cancer are diagnosed each year. Womb cancer is more common in women who have been through the menopause, and most cases are diagnosed in women aged 40 to 74. \n Womb cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers diagnosed in women.", "symptoms": "The most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don't have cancer. \n Bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the  menopause , so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual. \n In women who haven't been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of: \n \n periods that are heavier than usual \n vaginal bleeding in between normal periods \n \n Less common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex. \n If womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. These include: \n \n pain in the back, legs, or pelvis \n loss of appetite \n tiredness \n nausea \n \n When to seek medical advice \n If you have\u00a0postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your GP. \n Only\u00a01 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by\u00a0womb cancer, so it's unlikely your symptoms\u00a0will be caused by this condition. \n However, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it's important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated.\u00a0The bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as: \n \n  endometriosis \u00a0\u2013 where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb \n  fibroids \u00a0\u2013 non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus \n polyps in the womb lining \n \n Other types of gynaecological cancer can also\u00a0cause unusual\u00a0vaginal bleeding, particularly  cervical cancer . \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  womb cancer symptoms  \n Macmillan:  symptoms of womb cancer", "causes": "It's not known exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase your risk of developing it. \n Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. \n If left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system. \n Increased risk \n A number of things have been identified that\u00a0increase the risk of developing\u00a0womb cancer. Some of these are discussed below. \n Age \n The risk of developing\u00a0womb cancer increases with age. The majority of cases\u00a0occur in women aged 40 to 74, with only 1% of\u00a0cases being diagnosed in women under 40. \n Oestrogen \n The risk of developing womb cancer is linked to the body's\u00a0exposure to oestrogen. Oestrogen is one of the hormones that regulates the reproductive system in women. \n \n oestrogen stimulates the release of eggs from your ovaries and causes the cells of the\u00a0womb lining to divide \n progesterone gets the lining of your uterus ready to receive the egg from the ovaries \n \n The levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body are usually balanced with each other. If oestrogen isn't kept in balance by progesterone, the level in the body can increase. This is called unopposed oestrogen. \n After the  menopause , the body stops producing progesterone. However, there are still small amounts of oestrogen being produced. This unopposed oestrogen causes the cells of the endometrium to divide, which\u00a0can increase the risk of\u00a0womb cancer. \n Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \n Because of the link between increased levels of unopposed oestrogen and\u00a0womb cancer, oestrogen-only\u00a0 hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  should only be given to women who have had their womb surgically removed (hysterectomy). \n In all other cases, both oestrogen and progesterone (combination HRT) must be used in HRT to reduce the risk of womb cancer. \n Being overweight or obese \n As oestrogen can be produced in fatty tissue, being overweight or obese\u00a0increases the level of oestrogen in your body. This significantly increases your chances of developing womb cancer. \n Women who are overweight are 3\u00a0times more likely to develop womb cancer compared with women who are a healthy weight. Very obese women\u00a0are 6\u00a0times more likely to develop endometrial cancer compared with women who are a healthy weight. \n One way to assess whether your weight is healthy is to understand\u00a0 your healthy body mass index (BMI) . In the UK, people with a BMI of between 25\u00a0and 30 are overweight, and those with an index above 30 are obese. \n Reproductive history \n Women who have not had children are at a higher risk of\u00a0womb cancer. This may be because the increased levels of progesterone and decreased levels of oestrogen that occur during  pregnancy  have a protective effect on the lining of the womb. \n Tamoxifen \n Women who are treated with tamoxifen (a hormone treatment for  breast cancer ) can be at an increased risk of developing womb cancer. However, this risk is outweighed by the benefits that tamoxifen provides in preventing breast cancer. \n It's important to visit your GP if you're taking tamoxifen and experience any abnormal vaginal bleeding. \n Diabetes \n Women\u00a0with\u00a0 diabetes  are twice as likely to develop womb cancer as women without the condition. \n Diabetes causes an increase in the amount of insulin in your body, which in turn can raise your oestrogen levels. \n Many women with type 2 diabetes are also overweight, which further increases the risk. \n Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) \n Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are at a higher risk of developing womb cancer, as they have high levels of oestrogen in their bodies. \n Women with PCOS have multiple cysts in the ovary, which can cause symptoms such as irregular or light periods, or no periods at all, as well as\u00a0problems getting pregnant, weight gain, acne, and excessive hair growth (hirsutism). \n Endometrial hyperplasia \n Endometrial hyperplasia is when the lining of the womb becomes thicker. Women with the condition may be at an increased risk of developing\u00a0womb cancer. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  womb cancer risks and causes  \n Macmillan:  causes of womb cancer", "treatment": "Stages of womb cancer \n Health professionals use a staging system to describe how far womb cancer has advanced. These stages are: \n \n stage 1 \u2013\u00a0the cancer is still contained inside the womb (uterus) \n stage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread to the neck of the womb (the cervix) \n stage 3 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread outside the womb into nearby tissues in the pelvis or the lymph nodes \n stage 4 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread to the soft tissues of the abdomen, or into other organs, such as the bladder, bowel, liver, or lungs \n \n Your chances of surviving womb cancer depend on the stage at which it's diagnosed. \n If womb cancer is diagnosed at stage 1, the outlook is good and around 95% of women live for at least 5\u00a0more years.\u00a0Many women with stage 1 womb cancer are cured. \n If womb cancer is diagnosed at stage 2, you have around a 77% chance of living at least 5\u00a0more years. \n If the condition is diagnosed at stage 3, you have a 40% chance of living at least another 5\u00a0years. \n Around 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0womb cancers are diagnosed at stage 4. By this point, you only have a 15% chance of living at least 5\u00a0more years. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  stages of womb cancer  \n Cancer Research UK:  statistics and outlook for womb cancer  \n Macmillan:  staging and grading womb cancer \u00a0 \n \n Treatment overview \n The main treatment for womb cancer is to remove the womb (hysterectomy), together with the ovaries and fallopian tubes. This is sometimes followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy\u00a0to try to kill any possible remaining cancer cells, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer. \n Treatment for women who haven't been through the menopause \n Having a hysterectomy means you will\u00a0no longer be\u00a0able to get pregnant. Younger women who haven't already reached the  menopause  may not want to have their womb and ovaries removed if they wish to have children. \n In this case, under very specific circumstances it may be possible to treat the cancer using hormone therapy. \n Treating advanced cancer \n Advanced womb cancer\u00a0requires a different course of treatment, usually depending more on chemotherapy. \n Advanced cancer may not be curable, but the treatment aims to achieve a remission, where the cancer shrinks, making you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full. \n Even if there's no chance of a cure, surgery may be carried out to remove as much of the cancer as possible. \n Radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy can reduce symptoms such as pain by shrinking the cancer or slowing its growth. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  controlling symptoms of advanced womb cancer  \n Cancer Research UK:  which treatment for womb cancer?  \n \n Surgery \n Surgery for stage\u00a01\u00a0womb cancer \n If you have stage\u00a01 cancer, you'll probably have a hysterectomy. This involves removing both ovaries and the fallopian tubes in a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), as well as\u00a0the uterus (hysterectomy). \n The surgeon may also take samples from the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen and other nearby tissue. These will be sent to the laboratory to see whether the cancer has spread. \n The most common hysterectomy technique involves using one large cut across your tummy to access the womb and remove it. \n It's sometimes possible to use a technique called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, also known as a\u00a0keyhole hysterectomy. This involves using several small cuts so a special type of telescope (laparoscope) and other surgical instruments\u00a0can be used. \n This\u00a0means the surgeon\u00a0can see inside your body and remove your womb through your vagina with little scarring. \n You'll probably be ready to go home 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0days after your operation, or less if you had keyhole surgery. But it can take many weeks to recover fully. \n After your operation, you'll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. This is very important, and even if you have to stay in bed you'll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots. You'll be shown exercises by the nurses or physiotherapist to help prevent complications. \n When you go home, you'll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Discuss with your doctor or physiotherapist which types of exercise would be suitable for you. \n Surgery for stage\u00a02 or 3\u00a0womb cancer \n If you have stage\u00a02 or\u00a03 womb cancer and the cancer has spread to the cervix or nearby lymph nodes in the pelvis, you may have a radical or total hysterectomy. \n This involves the additional removal of the cervix and the top of your vagina, as well as the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes. You may also need radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment after surgery to reduce the risk\u00a0of the cancer returning. \n Surgery for advanced cancer (stage 4) \n If you have advanced womb cancer, you may have surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. This is called debulking surgery. \n This won't cure the cancer, but it may ease some of the symptoms. Your doctor will discuss whether debulking surgery is suitable for you. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  having your operation for womb cancer  \n National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE):  laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer  \n \n Radiotherapy \n A course of\u00a0 radiotherapy  will be recommended if your treatment team thinks there's a significant risk the cancer could return in the pelvis. Radiotherapy may also be used to slow the spread of cancer when a surgical cure is not possible. \n There are 2\u00a0types of radiotherapy used to treat\u00a0womb cancer: \n \n internal radiotherapy (also known as brachytherapy)\u00a0\u2013 where\u00a0a plastic tube is inserted inside the uterus and radiation treatment is passed down the tube into the womb \n external radiotherapy \u2013\u00a0where\u00a0a machine is used to deliver pulses of radiation to your pelvis \n \n A course of external radiotherapy is usually given to you as an outpatient for 5\u00a0days a week with a break at the weekend. The treatment takes a few minutes. The whole course of radiotherapy may last approximately 4\u00a0weeks depending on the stage and position of the womb cancer. \n Some women have internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) as well as external radiotherapy. During brachytherapy, the device that delivers radiation is placed in your vagina. \n There are different types of brachytherapy, involving either low, medium, or high dose rates. With low dose rate methods the radiation is delivered more slowly, so the device has to stay inside you for longer. You'll have to stay in hospital while you have the treatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you. \n Radiotherapy has some side effects. Skin in the treated area can become red and sore, and hair loss may occur. Radiotherapy to the pelvic area can affect the bowel and cause sickness and  diarrhoea . \n As your course of treatment progresses, you're likely to get very tired. Most of these side effects will go away when your treatment finishes, although around 5% of women continue with long-term treatment effects, such as diarrhoea and rectal bleeding. \n Chemotherapy \n If you have stage\u00a03 or\u00a04\u00a0womb cancer, you may be given a course of  chemotherapy . Chemotherapy can be used after surgery to try to prevent the return of the cancer. In cases of advanced cancer, it may be used to slow the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms. \n Chemotherapy is usually given as an injection into the vein (intravenously). You'll usually be able to go home the same day you have chemotherapy, but sometimes you may need a short stay in hospital. \n Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment being followed by a period of rest to allow the body to recover. \n Side effects of chemotherapy can include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n  hair loss \u00a0 \n fatigue \n \n There is also an increased risk of an infection developing in your bloodstream  (sepsis) , as your body's ability to fight infection is reduced by chemotherapy. \n The side effects should stop once treatment has finished. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  chemotherapy for womb cancer  \n Macmillan:  chemotherapy for womb cancer  \n \n Hormone therapy \n Some\u00a0womb cancers are affected by the female hormone oestrogen. These cancers may respond to treatment with hormone therapy. Your doctor will discuss\u00a0whether this is a possible treatment for your\u00a0womb cancer. \n Hormone therapy\u00a0usually\u00a0replaces\u00a0a hormone called progesterone, which naturally occurs in your body. Artificial progesterone is used and is\u00a0usually given as tablets. \n It's mainly used to treat advanced-stage\u00a0womb cancers, or cancer that has come back, and can help shrink the tumour and control any symptoms. \n The treatment may have some side effects, including mild nausea, mild muscle cramps, and weight gain. Your doctor will discuss these with you. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  hormone therapy for womb cancer  \n Macmillan:  hormonal treatment for womb cancer  \n \n Clinical trials \n A lot of progress has been made in the treatment of womb cancer, and more women are living longer with fewer side effects. Some of these advances were discovered through clinical trials,\u00a0where new treatments and combinations of treatments are compared with standard treatment. \n All cancer clinical trials in the UK are carefully monitored to make sure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials often do better overall than those in routine care. \n If you're invited to take part in a trial, you'll be given an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you'll be  asked to sign your consent . You're always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  trials and research  \n Cancer Research UK:  womb cancer research", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "You should visit your GP if you have abnormal vaginal bleeding. While it's unlikely to be caused by womb cancer, it's best to be sure. \n Your GP will probably carry out a physical examination of your pelvic area, including your vagina, womb, ovaries, and bladder. They will ask about your symptoms, when they happen, and how often. \n You may be referred to a specialist in conditions of the female reproductive organs (a gynaecologist) for further tests. Some of these tests are outlined below. \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of gynaecological cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected endometrial cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) \n Another test you may have is called a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU). TVU is a type of\u00a0 ultrasound scan  that uses a small scanner in the form of a probe. \n This is placed directly into the vagina to obtain a detailed picture of the inside of the uterus. The probe can feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful. \n The TVU checks whether there are any changes to the thickness of the lining of your uterus that could be caused by the presence of cancerous cells. \n Biopsy \n If the results of the TVU detect changes in the thickness of the lining of the uterus, you will usually have a\u00a0 biopsy  to confirm the diagnosis. \n In\u00a0a biopsy, a small sample of cells is taken from the lining of the womb (the endometrium). The sample is then checked at a laboratory for the presence of cancerous cells. \n The biopsy can be carried out in\u00a0several ways, including: \n \n aspiration biopsy \u2013 a small flexible tube is inserted into your vagina and up into your womb, and then sucks up a small sample of cells \n hysteroscopy \u2013 this allows the doctor to look at the inside of the womb using a thin type of telescope called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through your vagina and into your womb, allowing the doctor to look at the lining of the womb and take a sample from it \n \n In some cases, a  hysteroscopy \u00a0may be used before dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C). D&amp;C is a minor surgical procedure\u00a0carried out under  general anaesthetic ,\u00a0where some tissue from the womb lining is removed. The tissue\u00a0is then sent off to a laboratory for further testing. \n Blood test \n A  blood test  can sometimes help diagnose womb cancer. This is because some cancerous tumours release certain chemicals into your blood, known as tumour markers, which can be detected during a blood test. \n However, this type of test isn't very reliable. The presence of these chemicals doesn't mean you definitely have womb cancer. Some people with womb cancer don't have these chemicals in their blood. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  womb cancer tests  \n Macmillan:  how womb cancer is diagnosed  \n \n Tests if you have\u00a0womb cancer \n If you're diagnosed with womb cancer, you may have further tests\u00a0to help determine the stage of the cancer.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Whooping cough", "introduction": "Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. \n It causes repeated\u00a0coughing bouts that can last for two\u00a0to three months or more, and can make babies and young children in particular very ill. \n Whooping cough is spread in\u00a0the droplets\u00a0of the coughs or sneezes of someone with the infection. \n This page covers: \n  Symptoms  \n  Who's at risk  \n  When to get medical advice  \n  Treatment  \n  Stopping the infection spreading  \n  Vaccinations  \n  Complications  \n Symptoms of whooping cough \n The first symptoms\u00a0of whooping cough are\u00a0similar to those of a\u00a0 cold , such as\u00a0a runny nose,\u00a0red and watery eyes,\u00a0a sore throat, and\u00a0a slightly raised temperature. \n Intense\u00a0coughing bouts start about a week later. \n \n The bouts\u00a0usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night. \n Coughing usually brings up thick\u00a0mucus and may be followed by vomiting. \n Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0may cause a \"whoop\" sound,\u00a0although not everyone has this. \n The strain of coughing can\u00a0cause the\u00a0face\u00a0to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in\u00a0the eyes. \n Young children can sometimes briefly\u00a0turn blue (cyanosis)\u00a0if they have trouble breathing\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this often looks worse than it is and their breathing should\u00a0start again\u00a0quickly. \n In very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing. \n \n The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time,\u00a0but it may be a\u00a0few\u00a0months before they stop completely. \n Who's at risk of whooping cough \n Whooping cough can affect people of any age, including: \n \n babies and young children \u2013\u00a0young babies under six months of age are at a particularly increased risk of\u00a0 complications of whooping cough  \n older children and adults \u2013 it tends to be less serious in these cases, but can still be unpleasant and\u00a0frustrating \n people who've had whooping cough before \u2013 you're not immune to whooping cough\u00a0if you've had it before, although it tends to be less severe the second time around \n people vaccinated against whooping cough as a child \u2013 protection from the\u00a0 whooping cough vaccine  tends to wear off after a few years \n \n You can get whooping cough if you come into close contact with someone with the infection. \n A person with whooping cough is infectious from about six days after they were infected\u00a0\u2013 when they just have cold-like symptoms\u00a0\u2013 until three weeks after the coughing bouts start. \n Antibiotic treatment can reduce the length of time someone is infectious. \n When to get medical advice \n See your GP or\u00a0call the NHS 24\u00a0'111'\u00a0if you or your child: \n \n have symptoms of\u00a0whooping cough \n have\u00a0had a cough for more than three weeks \n have a cough that is particularly severe or is getting worse \n \n Call 999 or go\u00a0to\u00a0your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department\u00a0if\u00a0you or your child: \n \n have significant breathing difficulties, such as long periods of breathlessness or choking, shallow breathing, periods where breathing stops, or dusky, blue skin\u00a0 \n develop signs of serious  complications of whooping cough , such as fits (seizures) or\u00a0 pneumonia  \n \n Treatment for whooping cough \n Treatment for whooping cough depends on your age\u00a0and how long you've had the infection. \n \n Children under six months who are very ill and people with severe symptoms will usually be admitted to hospital for treatment. \n People\u00a0diagnosed during the first three weeks of infection may be prescribed\u00a0 antibiotics \u00a0to take at home\u00a0\u2013 these will help stop the infection spreading to others, but may not reduce\u00a0the symptoms. \n People who've had whooping cough for more than three weeks won't normally need any specific treatment, as they're no longer contagious and antibiotics are unlikely\u00a0to\u00a0help. \n \n While you're recovering at home, it can help to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, clean away mucus and sick from\u00a0your or your child's mouth, and take painkillers such as\u00a0 paracetamol  or\u00a0 ibuprofen  for a fever. \n Avoid using cough medicines, as they're not suitable for young children and are unlikely to be of much help. \n Stopping the infection spreading \n If you or your child are taking antibiotics for whooping cough, you need to be careful not to spread the infection to others. \n \n Stay away from nursery, school\u00a0or work until\u00a0five days from the start of antibiotic treatment or three weeks after the coughing bouts started (whichever is sooner). \n Cover your or your child's mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing. \n Dispose of used tissues immediately. \n Wash your and your child's hands regularly\u00a0with soap and water. \n \n Other members of your household may also be given antibiotics and a\u00a0dose of the whooping cough vaccine to stop them becoming infected. \n Vaccinations for whooping cough \n There are three routine vaccinations that can protect babies and children from whooping cough: \n \n the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy\u00a0\u2013 this can protect your baby during the first few weeks of life;\u00a0the best time to have it is soon after the 16th week of your pregnancy \n the 5-in-1 vaccine\u00a0\u2013\u00a0offered to babies at 8,\u00a012 and 16 weeks of age \n the 4-in-1 pre-school booster\u00a0\u2013 offered to children\u00a0by\u00a03 years and 4 months \n \n These vaccines don't offer lifelong protection from whooping cough, but they can help stop\u00a0children getting it when they're young and more vulnerable to the effects of the infection. \n Older children and adults aren't routinely vaccinated, except during pregnancy or a whooping cough outbreak. \n Complications of whooping cough \n Babies and young children under six months are usually most severely affected by whooping cough. \n They're at an\u00a0increased risk of: \n \n  dehydration  \n breathing difficulties \n weight loss \n  pneumonia \u00a0\u2013 an infection of the lungs \n fits (seizures) \n kidney problems \n brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen reaching\u00a0the brain \n death\u00a0\u2013 although this is very rare \n \n Older children and adults tend to be less severely affected, although they may experience problems caused by repeated coughing, such as  nosebleeds , bruised ribs or a\u00a0hernia.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "",

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Wilms\u2019 tumour", "introduction": "Wilms\u2019 tumour is a type of kidney cancer in children. About 70 children in the UK develop a Wilms\u2019 tumour each year. It most often affects children under the age of five. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it\u2019s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Wilms\u2019 tumour \n Wilms\u2019 tumour is a type of kidney cancer that was named after Dr Max Wilms, who first described it. It is thought to come from very specialised cells in the embryo known as metanephric blastema. These cells are involved in the development of the child\u2019s kidneys while they are in the womb. The cells usually disappear at birth, but in many children with Wilms\u2019 tumour, clusters of primitive kidneys cells, called nephrogenic rests can still be found. \n The kidneys \n The kidneys are a pair of organs found at the back of the abdomen. They clean the blood by removing excess fluids and waste products, which are then converted into urine. \n Causes \n In most children, the causes of Wilms\u2019 tumour are unknown. Very rarely, people who develop Wilms\u2019 tumour have other specific conditions which are present at birth (congenital malformations). These include the lack of an iris in the eye (aniridia), abnormalities of the genitals, and a condition where one side of the body is slightly larger than the other (hemihypertrophy). \n In 1 in 100 people with Wilms\u2019 tumour, another family member will also have Wilms\u2019 tumour. \n Signs and symptoms \n The most common symptom is a swollen abdomen, which is usually painless. Sometimes a parent or carer may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. There may be blood in your child\u2019s urine, or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite. \n How Wilms\u2019 tumour is diagnosed \n A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a Wilms\u2019 tumour. \n An abdominal ultrasound scan is usually the first thing that is done. This will be followed by an  MRI  and/or  CT scan  of the abdomen and chest. These scans help doctors to identify exactly where the tumour is and whether it has spread beyond the kidney. This is known as staging. Urine and blood samples will also be taken to check your child\u2019s kidney function and general health. Most children will go on to have a  biopsy , where a sample of tissue is taken from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. \n Staging \n The stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and the stage of the cancer helps doctors decide on the most appropriate treatment. \n In the case of a Wilms\u2019 tumour, the stage is finalised after surgery to remove the tumour. As most Wilms\u2019 tumour patients receive chemotherapy before surgery, you may not know the exact stage of your child\u2019s tumour straight away. An exception is that babies under six months old usually have surgery straight away. \n A commonly-used staging system for Wilms\u2019 tumour is described below: \n  Stage 1  \n The tumour is only affecting the kidney and has not begun to spread. It can be completely removed with surgery. \n  Stage 2  \n The tumour has begun to spread beyond the kidney to nearby structures, but it\u2019s still possible to remove it completely with surgery. \n  Stage 3  \n The tumour has spread beyond the kidney; either because the tumour has burst before (or during) the operation, has spread to lymph glands (nodes), or has not been completely removed by surgery. \n  Stage 4  \n The tumour has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or liver. Tumours in other parts of the body are known as metastases. \n  Stage 5  \n There are tumours in both kidneys (bilateral Wilms\u2019 tumour). \n If the tumour comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent cancer or relapse. \n Treatment \n Treatment is planned by specialists in children\u2019s tumours and cancers. This is usually based in a children\u2019s oncology unit within a main hospital, but some treatment may be given closer to home. \n Treatment will depend on a number of factors including how the cells appear under the microscope (histology) and the stage of the tumour. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery. \n  Surgery  \n All children with Wilms\u2019 tumour will have surgery. Initially, this may only involve taking a small sample of cells from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. This is called a biopsy and is usually done under a general anaesthetic using a needle inserted through the skin. \n Apart from very young children (under six months), most patients will receive chemotherapy before having a bigger operation to remove the entire tumour. The operation usually involves removing the whole of the affected kidney (nephrectomy). \n After examining the whole tumour under the microscope, Wilms\u2019 tumours can be divided into a number of risk groups based on knowledge about how these different types of tumours are likely to behave. The treatment following surgery will depend on these risk groups. The risk groups are known as LOW, STANDARD (or INTERMEDIATE), and HIGH. \n The majority of tumours are in the \u2018standard risk\u2019 group. So called \u2018low risk\u2019 tumours require less treatment than standard risk tumours. \n Two types of Wilms\u2019 tumour - anaplastic and blastemal - are considered to be \u2018higher risk\u2019 than other Wilms\u2019 tumours and require more intensive (stronger) chemotherapy: \n  Anaplastic Wilms\u2019 tumour  \n About 5-10% of Wilms\u2019 tumours have an appearance called anaplasia, which means the cells look very disorganised under a microscope. \n  Blastemal Wilms\u2019 tumour  \n This group of high-risk tumours cannot be identified by looking at the biopsy because they occur when a particular type of early kidney cell survives the pre-surgery chemotherapy. These cells are known as blastemal cells. Tumours where most of these cells survive chemotherapy are called blastemal tumours. \n  Other kidney tumours  \n Other, less common types of kidney tumours may occur in children. These are usually only recognised after surgery to obtain a tumour sample. \u2018Clear cell sarcoma\u2019 and \u2018malignant rhabdoid tumour\u2019 of the kidney are two types of cancerous tumour, with their own treatment recommendations. \n Congenital mesoblastic nephroma is a non-cancerous (benign) tumour that occurs in very young children; this type of tumour usually only needs surgery and no other treatment. \n  Chemotherapy  \n  Chemotherapy  is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It\u2019s usually given as an injection or drip into a vein (intravenously). Chemotherapy given before surgery is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. \n What doctors find out about the tumour after surgery - for example, how the cells look under the microscope and how far the cancer has spread - helps them to decide whether additional chemotherapy should be given (adjuvant chemotherapy). This is to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). This chemotherapy may be given as inpatient or outpatient depending on tumour staging and risk group (see above). \n  Radiotherapy  \n  Radiotherapy  treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. \n Not all children with Wilms\u2019 tumour need radiotherapy. For those that do, the area to be treated depends on the stage of the tumour at diagnosis. Some children receive radiotherapy to the area around the affected kidney or, less commonly, to the whole abdomen. If the tumour has spread to the lungs, then lung radiotherapy may be needed but this depends on how well the cancer responds to initial chemotherapy; it\u2019s not always needed. \n Radiotherapy may occasionally be used to shrink tumours that are too large to remove surgically. This will, ideally, allow an operation to be done. Radiotherapy can also be used when tumours have spread elsewhere in the body. \n  Treatment for bilateral Wilms\u2019 tumour  \n In about 1 in 20 cases, Wilms\u2019 tumour affects both kidneys. Treatment usually involves surgery to both. The aim of the treatment is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, while leaving as much healthy kidney as possible. Chemotherapy is always given. Sometimes radiotherapy is needed as well. \n Side effects of treatment \n Treatment for Wilms\u2019 tumour often causes side effects. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Many side effects are expected and managed effectively. Side effects can include feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting), hair loss, bruising and bleeding, tiredness, diarrhoea, and an increased risk of infection. Less common effects may include impact on the heart, kidneys, and liver. \n Late side effects \n A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart and lungs work, and a slight increase in their risk of developing another cancer in later life. Infertility is a possible late side effect, although this is rare. \n Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. These will depend on the exact treatments given. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness. The trial may include comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. It may just involve collecting patient and tumour details including response to treatment to increase specialists\u2019 knowledge. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you will be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Most children with Wilms\u2019 tumour are cured. If the cancer comes back, it\u2019s usually within the first two years. When one kidney is removed, the other will be able to work normally and can take over the work of the other kidney. \n Very few children have long-term kidney problems. Your child will have regular check-ups to look for any recurrence or problems following treatment. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Vomiting in adults", "introduction": "Nausea and vomiting in adults isn't usually a sign of anything serious and tends to only last 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0days.  \n Vomiting\u00a0is the body\u2019s way of ridding itself of harmful substances from the stomach, or it may be\u00a0a reaction to something that has irritated the gut. \n One of the most common causes of vomiting in adults is  gastroenteritis . This is\u00a0an infection of the gut usually caused by bacteria or a virus, which\u00a0will normally improve within a few days. \n However, vomiting can occasionally be a sign of something more serious, such as  appendicitis , so if you are feeling very unwell or are worried about your vomiting, trust your instincts and call your GP. \n There is a separate topic on vomiting in children and babies. \n When to contact your GP \n Contact\u00a0your GP if: \n \n you've been vomiting\u00a0repeatedly for more than a day or two \n you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly \n your vomit is green (this could mean you are bringing up a fluid called bile, which suggests you may have a blockage in your bowel \u2013 see below) \n you have  signs of severe dehydration , such as\u00a0confusion,\u00a0a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes\u00a0and passing little or no urine \n you've lost a lot of weight since you became ill \n you experience episodes of vomiting frequently \n \n Your GP may want to investigate the cause of your vomiting or prescribe treatment. \n You should also see your GP if you have\u00a0 diabetes  and have been vomiting persistently, particularly if you need to take insulin. This is because prolonged vomiting can affect your blood sugar level. \n When to seek emergency medical help \n Occasionally, vomiting can be a sign of a more serious problem. \n You should call 999 for an ambulance, or go to\u00a0your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department if you also have: \n \n sudden, severe abdominal (tummy) pain \n severe\u00a0chest pain \n blood in your vomit\u00a0or what looks like coffee granules \n a\u00a0stiff neck and high temperature (fever) \n a sudden, severe  headache \u00a0that's unlike any headache you've had before \n \n You should also\u00a0seek emergency medical help\u00a0if you think you have swallowed something poisonous. \n Common causes of vomiting in adults \n Gastroenteritis \n If you have\u00a0 diarrhoea \u00a0as well as vomiting, it's likely you have gastroenteritis. This\u00a0is one of the most common causes of vomiting in adults. \n It's often the result of\u00a0a virus\u00a0picked up from someone who's ill, such as\u00a0the  norovirus , or\u00a0 food poisoning \u00a0caused by bacteria found in contaminated food. \n Your immune system will usually fight off the infection after a few days and the self-care measures described above can help in the meantime. Read more about  treating gastroenteritis . \n Pregnancy \n Pregnant women typically experience repeated episodes of nausea and vomiting, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. This is often called \"morning sickness\", although it can occur throughout the day. \n In most cases, morning sickness will develop at some point during the first 3\u00a0months of pregnancy and will pass by about weeks 16-20. Read more about morning sickness, including things you can do to help reduce your symptoms. \n Migraines \n If you\u00a0have recurrent episodes of vomiting along with intense, throbbing headaches that last for a few hours to days at a time, you may be experiencing\u00a0 migraines . \n Conventional painkillers, such as\u00a0 paracetamol  and  ibuprofen ,\u00a0can sometimes help control the pain and\u00a0your GP can prescribe\u00a0anti-sickness medicine to help prevent vomiting. Read more about  treating migraines . \n Labyrinthitis \n If your vomiting is accompanied\u00a0by\u00a0dizziness and a feeling of spinning ( vertigo ), it may be caused by\u00a0an inner ear infection called\u00a0 labyrinthitis . \n Labyrinthitis will usually improve over a few days, and your GP can\u00a0prescribe medication to reduce your symptoms if necessary. \n Motion sickness \n Nausea and vomiting associated with travelling could be a sign of motion sickness. \n These\u00a0symptoms can sometimes be improved using techniques such as fixing your eyes on the horizon or distracting yourself by listening to music, although medication to prevent and treat motion sickness is also available.\u00a0 \n Appendicitis \n As well as vomiting,\u00a0 appendicitis \u00a0can cause severe pain in your abdomen (tummy). You should call 999 for an ambulance if you experience pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs that your appendix may have burst. \n If you have appendicitis, you will often need surgery to remove your appendix. Read more about  treating appendicitis . \n Other\u00a0causes of vomiting in adults \n Vomiting in adults can also be caused by a number of other things, including: \n \n certain medicines, such as  antibiotics  and opioid painkillers \n drinking too much alcohol \n  kidney infections \u00a0and  kidney stones  \n a blockage in your bowel, which may be caused by a hernia or  gallstones  \n  chemotherapy \u00a0and\u00a0 radiotherapy  \n acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) \n \n Clink on the links above for more information about these conditions and treatments. \n Looking after yourself at home \n In most cases, you won't need any specific treatment and can take care of yourself at home until you feel better. \n The most important thing you can do is to keep taking small sips of water frequently so you don't become  dehydrated . \n A sweet drink such as fruit juice can be useful for replacing lost sugar, although you should avoid sweet drinks if they make you feel sick. Salty snacks, such as crisps, can help replace lost salt. \n You may also find ginger helps to relieve your nausea and vomiting. This is available as supplements, or can be found in ginger biscuits and ginger tea. Check with your pharmacist or GP before using ginger supplements.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Vulval cancer", "introduction": "Cancer of the vulva is a rare type of cancer that affects women. Around 1,200 new cases are diagnosed each year in the UK. \n The vulva is a woman's external genitals. It includes\u00a0the lips surrounding the vagina (labia minora and labia majora), the clitoris (sexual organ\u00a0that helps women reach sexual climax), and the Bartholin's glands (2\u00a0small glands each side of the vagina). \n Most of those affected by vulval cancer are older women over the age of 65. The condition is rare in women under 50 who have not yet gone through the  menopause . \n Symptoms of vulval cancer \n Symptoms of vulval cancer can include: \n \n a persistent itch in the vulva \n pain, soreness or tenderness\u00a0in\u00a0the vulva \n raised and thickened patches of skin that can\u00a0be red, white or dark \n a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva \n bleeding from the vulva or\u00a0blood-stained\u00a0vaginal discharge between periods \n an open sore in the vulva \n a burning pain\u00a0when passing urine \n a\u00a0mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour \n \n See your GP if you notice any changes in the usual appearance of your vulva. While it's highly unlikely to be the result of\u00a0cancer, these changes should be investigated. \n Read more about  diagnosing vulval cancer . \n What causes vulval cancer? \n The exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition\u00a0is increased by the following factors: \n \n increasing age \n vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) \u2013 where the cells\u00a0in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous \n persistent infection with certain versions\u00a0of the\u00a0human papilloma virus (HPV) \n skin conditions affecting the vulva,\u00a0such as\u00a0lichen sclerosus \n smoking \n \n You may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an HPV infection. \n Read more about the  causes of vulval cancer . \n How vulval cancer is treated \n The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells. \n Some people may also have  radiotherapy  (where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells) or  chemotherapy \u00a0(where medication is used to kill cancer cells), or both. \n Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you're not well enough to have an operation, or if\u00a0the cancer has spread and it isn't possible to remove it all. \n Read more about  treating vulval cancer . \n Outlook \n The outlook for vulval cancer depends on things such as how far the cancer has spread, your age, and your general health. Generally, the earlier the cancer is detected and the younger you are, the better the chances of treatment being successful. \n Overall, around\u00a06 in every 10 women diagnosed with vulval cancer will survive at least 5\u00a0years. However, even after successful\u00a0treatment, the cancer comes back in up to 1\u00a0in every 3\u00a0cases. You'll need regular follow-up appointments so your doctor can check if this is happening. \n Can\u00a0vulval cancer be prevented? \n It's not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by: \n \n practising\u00a0safer sex\u00a0\u2013 using a condom during sex can offer some protection against HPV \n attending\u00a0 cervical screening \u00a0appointments\u00a0\u2013\u00a0cervical screening can detect HPV and pre-cancerous conditions such as VIN \n  stopping smoking  \n \n The\u00a0 HPV vaccination \u00a0may also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer. This is now offered to all girls\u00a0who are 12 to 13 years old as part of their routine childhood immunisation programme.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. \n The exact reason why this happens in cases of vulval cancer is unknown, but certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition. \n These include: \n \n increasing age \n vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) \n human papilloma virus (HPV) infection \n skin conditions that can affect the vulva, such as\u00a0lichen sclerosus \n smoking \n \n These factors are described in more detail below. \n Increasing age \n The risk of developing vulval cancer increases as you get older. Most cases develop in women aged 65 or over, although very occasionally women under 50 can be affected. \n Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) \n Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition. This means\u00a0there are changes to certain cells in the vulva that aren't cancerous, but\u00a0could potentially turn into cancer at a later date. This is a gradual process that\u00a0usually takes well over 10 years. \n In some cases, the abnormal cells may go away by themselves. However, because of the risk of cancer, treatment to remove the affected cells is often recommended. \n Symptoms of\u00a0VIN\u00a0are similar to those of vulval cancer, and include persistent itchiness\u00a0of the vulva and raised discoloured patches. See your GP if you have these symptoms. \n There are 2\u00a0types of\u00a0VIN: \n \n usual or undifferentiated VIN \u2013 this\u00a0usually affects\u00a0women under 50 and is thought to be caused by an HPV infection \n differentiated VIN (dVIN) \u2013 this is a rarer type, usually affecting women\u00a0over 60, associated with skin conditions that affect the vulva \n \n You can read more about HPV and the skin conditions associated with vulval cancer\u00a0below. \n Human papilloma virus (HPV) \n Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name given to a group of viruses that affect the skin and the moist membranes that line the body, such as those in the cervix, anus, mouth and throat.\u00a0It's spread during sex, including anal and oral sex. \n There are many different types of HPV, and most\u00a0people are infected with the virus at some time during their lives. In most cases, the virus goes away without causing any harm and doesn't lead to further problems. \n However, HPV is present in at least 40% of women with vulval cancer, which suggests it may increase your risk of developing the condition. HPV is known to cause changes in the cells of the cervix, which can lead to  cervical cancer . It's thought the virus could have a similar effect on the cells of the vulva, which is\u00a0known as VIN. \n Skin conditions \n Several skin conditions can affect the vulva. In a small number of cases these are associated with an increased\u00a0risk of vulval cancer. \n Two of the main conditions associated with vulval cancer are lichen sclerosus and\u00a0 lichen planus . Both of these conditions cause the vulva to become itchy, sore and discoloured. \n It's estimated that less than 5% of women who develop one of these conditions will go on to develop vulval cancer. It's not clear whether treating these conditions reduces this risk. \n Smoking \n Smoking increases your risk of developing VIN and vulval cancer. This may be because\u00a0smoking makes the immune system less effective, and less able to clear the HPV virus from your body and more vulnerable to the effects of the virus.", "treatment": "Treatment for vulval cancer depends on factors such as how far the cancer has spread, your general health, and personal wishes. \n The main\u00a0options are surgery,\u00a0 radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy . Many women with vulval cancer have a combination of these treatments. \n If your cancer is at an early stage, it's often possible to get rid of it completely.\u00a0However, this may not be possible if the cancer has spread. \n Even after successful treatment, there is up to a 1\u00a0in 3\u00a0chance of the cancer returning at some point later on, so you'll need regular follow-up appointments to check for this. \n Your treatment plan \n Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat vulval cancer. MDTs are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. \n Members of your MDT will probably include a specialist surgeon, a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer (clinical oncologist) and a specialist cancer nurse. \n Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. \n Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments. \n Surgery to remove vulval cancer \n In most cases, your treatment plan will involve some form of surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the stage of the cancer. \n There are 3\u00a0surgical options to treat vulval cancer: \n \n radical wide local excision \u2013\u00a0the cancerous tissue from your vulva is removed, as a well as a margin of healthy tissue, usually at least\u00a01cm wide, as a precaution \n radical partial vulvectomy \u2013 a larger section\u00a0of\u00a0your vulva is removed, such as\u00a0one or both of the labia and the clitoris \n radical vulvectomy \u2013 the\u00a0whole vulva is removed, including the inner and outer labia, and possibly the clitoris \n \n The time it will take you to recover from surgery will depend on the type of surgery and how extensive it was. For extensive operations, such as a pelvic exenteration, it may be many weeks or months\u00a0before you start to\u00a0feel better. \n Your surgeon will talk to you about the possible risks associated with the type of procedure you're having. Possible risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, altered sensation in your vulva, and problems having sex. \n Assessing and removing groin lymph nodes \n An additional operation may also be required to assess whether the cancerous cells have spread into one or more lymph nodes in your groin, and remove these if they're found to contain cancer. This may involve one or more of the procedures outlined below. \n Sentinel node biopsy \n If the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, it's sometimes possible to only remove certain lymph nodes, known as\u00a0sentinel nodes. \n Sentinel\u00a0nodes are identified by injecting a dye at the site of the tumour and studying\u00a0its flow\u00a0to locate the nodes closest to the tumour. These are then removed and checked for cancerous cells. \n Groin lymphadenectomy \n In some cases, some or all of the nodes in your groin\u00a0may need to be surgically removed. This is called a groin or\u00a0inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. Further treatment with radiotherapy may also be\u00a0recommended. \n Removing cancerous lymph nodes\u00a0reduces the risk of the cancer returning, but it can make you more vulnerable to infection and cause swelling in your legs from a build-up of lymphatic fluid  (lymphoedema) . \n Pelvic exenteration \n In cases of advanced vulval cancer or where the cancer returns after previous treatment, an operation called a pelvic exenteration may be recommended. This involves removing your entire vulva as well as your bladder, womb and part of your bowel. This is a major operation and isn't carried out very often these days. \n If a section of your bowel is removed, it will be necessary for your surgeon to divert your bowel through\u00a0an opening made in your tummy (a stoma). Stools then pass along this piece of bowel and into a bag you wear over the stoma. This is known as\u00a0a  colostomy . \n If your bladder is removed, urine can be passed out of your body into a pouch via a stoma. This is\u00a0known as a urostomy. Alternatively,\u00a0it may be possible to create a new bladder by removing a section of your bowel and using it to create a pouch to store urine in. \n Reconstructive surgery \n If only a small amount of tissue has been removed during surgery, the skin of the vulva\u00a0can often be neatly stitched together. \n Otherwise, it may be necessary to reconstruct the vulva using a\u00a0skin graft,\u00a0where a piece of skin is taken from your thigh or\u00a0tummy and moved to\u00a0the wound in your\u00a0vulva. Another option is to have a\u00a0skin flap, where\u00a0an\u00a0area of skin near the vulva is used to create a flap and\u00a0cover the wound. \n These reconstructive procedures are usually carried out at the same time as the operation to remove the cancer. \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy  involves using high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. There are several ways it\u00a0can be used to treat vulval cancer: \n \n before surgery to\u00a0try\u00a0to\u00a0shrink a large cancer\u00a0\u2013 this is to\u00a0help make the operation possible without removing nearby organs \n after surgery\u00a0to destroy any cancerous cells that may be left\u00a0\u2013 for example, for cases where cancer cells\u00a0have spread to the lymph nodes in the groin \n as an alternative to surgery, if you're not well enough to have an operation \n to relieve symptoms in cases where a complete cure is not possible \u2013 this is known as palliative radiotherapy \n \n In most cases, you'll have external radiotherapy, where a machine directs beams of radiation\u00a0on to the section of the body that contains the cancer. \n This\u00a0is normally given in daily sessions, 5\u00a0days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes.\u00a0The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks. \n Side effects \n While radiation is effective in killing cancerous cells, it can also damage healthy tissues. This can\u00a0lead to a number of side effects, such as: \n \n sore skin around the vulva area \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n feeling tired all the time \n loss of pubic hair, which may be permanent \n swelling of the vulva \n narrowing of your vagina, which can make sex difficult \n inflammation of your bladder  (cystitis)  \n \n In younger women, external radiotherapy can sometimes trigger an early  menopause .\u00a0This means they\u00a0will no longer be able to have any children. \n Read more about the  side effects of radiotherapy . \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy  is where medication is used to kill cancer cells. It's usually given by injection. \n It's usually used if vulval cancer comes back or to control symptoms when a cure is not possible. Sometimes it may be combined with radiotherapy. \n Side effects \n The medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue, as well as the cancerous tissue. Side effects are common and include: \n \n tiredness \n feeling and being\u00a0sick \n hair thinning or\u00a0 hair\u00a0loss  \n sore mouth and  mouth ulcers \u00a0 \n an increased risk of infections \u2013 tell your care team if you develop any symptoms of an infection, and try to avoid close contact with people known to have an infection \n \n These side effects should pass once treatment has finished. \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy .\u00a0 \n Emotional support \n The emotional impact of living with vulval cancer can be significant. Many people report experiencing a kind of rollercoaster effect. You may feel down at receiving a diagnosis, feel up when the cancer has been removed from your body, and then feel down again as you try to come to terms with the after-effects of surgery. \n Some people experience feelings of\u00a0 depression . If you think you may be depressed, contact your GP or care team for advice. There are a range of treatments that can help. \n You may also find it useful to contact one of the main cancer charities, such as: \n \n  Macmillan Cancer Support \u00a0\u2013 the helpline\u00a0is available\u00a0on 0808 808 00 00, Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm \n  Cancer Research UK \u00a0\u2013 a cancer nurse helpline is available\u00a0on 0808 800 4040, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you notice any changes in the normal appearance of your vulva. \n Your GP will ask you about your symptoms, look at your medical history, and\u00a0examine your vulva to look for any lumps or unusual areas of skin. \n If you would prefer to be examined by a\u00a0female doctor or you would like a nurse present during the examination, it may help to let your GP surgery\u00a0know in advance of your appointment. \n Referral to a gynaecologist \n If your GP feels some further tests are necessary, they will refer you to a hospital specialist called a gynaecologist. A gynaecologist is a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) recommends that GPs consider referring a woman who has an unexplained vulval lump or\u00a0ulcer, or unexplained bleeding. \n The gynaecologist\u00a0will\u00a0ask\u00a0about your symptoms and examine your vulva again, and they may recommend\u00a0a\u00a0test called a biopsy to determine whether you do have cancer.\u00a0 \n Biopsy \n A\u00a0 biopsy \u00a0is where\u00a0a small sample of\u00a0tissue is removed so it can be examined under a microscope to see if the cells are cancerous. \n This is often done\u00a0after a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  has been given to numb the area, which\u00a0means the procedure shouldn't be painful and you can go home the same day. Occasionally, it may be done under\u00a0 general anaesthetic  (where you're asleep), which may require an overnight stay in hospital. \n Your doctor may put a few stitches in the area where the biopsy was taken from.\u00a0You may have slight bleeding and soreness for a few days afterwards. \n Your doctor will usually see you 7\u00a0to 10 days later to discuss the results with you. \n Further tests \n If the results of the biopsy show cancer, you may need further tests to assess how widespread it is. \n These may include: \n \n a colposcopy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a procedure where a microscope is used to check for abnormal cells in the vagina \n a cystoscopy\u00a0\u2013 an examination of the inside of the bladder using a thin, hollow\u00a0tube\u00a0inserted into the bladder \n a proctoscopy \u2013 an examination of the inside of the rectum \n biopsies of the lymph nodes near your vulva\u00a0to\u00a0check whether cancer has spread through your lymphatic system \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan \u00a0or  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0\u2013 scans to check for signs of cancer in your lymph nodes or other organs \n an  X-ray  to check that cancer has not spread to your lungs \n \n The results of these tests will allow your doctor to \"stage\" your cancer. This means using a number system to indicate how far the cancer has spread. \n Staging \n Vulval cancers are staged using a number from 1 to 4. The lower the stage, the less the cancer has spread and the greater the chance of treatment being successful. \n The staging system for vulval cancer is: \n \n Stage 1 \u2013 the cancer is confined to the vulva \n Stage 2 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread to other nearby parts of the body, such as the lower vagina, anus or lower urethra (the tube urine passes through\u00a0out of the body), but the lymph nodes are unaffected \n Stage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes \n Stage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread\u00a0to other parts of the body, including more distant lymph nodes \n \n Stage 1 and 2 vulval cancers are generally regarded as early-stage cancers with a relatively good chance of being treated successfully. Stage 3 and 4 cancers are usually regarded as advanced-stage cancers and a complete cure for these types of cancers may not always be possible."},

It's the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning. \n This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that\u00a0you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks. \n Attacks of vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds, or they may last much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making normal life very difficult. \n Other symptoms associated with vertigo may include: \n \n loss of balance \u2013 which can make it difficult to stand or walk \n feeling sick or being sick \n dizziness\u00a0 \n \n Seeking medical help \n You should see you GP if you have persistent signs of vertigo or it keeps coming back. \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms and can carry out a simple examination to help determine\u00a0some types of\u00a0vertigo. They may also refer you for further tests. \n Read more about  diagnosing vertigo  \n What causes vertigo? \n Vertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, although it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain. \n Causes of vertigo may\u00a0include: \n \n benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) \u2013 where certain head movements trigger vertigo \n  migraines  \u2013 severe headaches \n  labyrinthitis  \u2013 an inner ear infection \n vestibular neuronitis \u2013 inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which runs into the inner ear and sends messages to the brain that help to control balance \n \n Depending on the\u00a0condition causing vertigo, you may experience additional symptoms, such as\u00a0a high temperature, ringing in your ears\u00a0( tinnitus ) and  hearing loss . \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of vertigo  \n How is vertigo treated? \n Some cases of vertigo improve over time, without treatment. However, some people have repeated episodes for many months, or even years, such as those with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. \n There are specific treatments for some causes of vertigo. A series of simple head movements (known as the\u00a0Epley manoeuvre) is used to treat BPPV. \n Medicines, such as prochlorperazine and some antihistamines,\u00a0can help in the early stages or most cases of vertigo. \n Many people with vertigo also benefit from vestibular rehabilitation training (VRT), which\u00a0is a\u00a0series of exercises for people with dizziness and balance problems.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Read more about\u00a0 treating vertigo  \n Self care \n Depending on what's causing your vertigo, there may be things you can do yourself to help relieve your symptoms. Your GP or the specialist treating you may advise you\u00a0to: \n \n do simple exercises to correct your symptoms \n sleep with your head slightly raised on two or more pillows \n get up slowly when getting out of bed and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or so before standing \n avoid bending down to pick up items \n avoid extending your neck \u2013 for example, while reaching up to a high shelf \n move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities \n do exercises that trigger your vertigo, so your brain gets used to it and reduces the symptoms (do these only after making sure you won't fall, and have support if needed) \n \n Fear of heights \n The term vertigo is often incorrectly used to describe a fear of heights. The medical term for a fear of heights and the dizzy feeling associated with looking down from a high place is \"acrophobia\". \n Read more about  phobias  for advice and\u00a0information.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Vertigo is a symptom of several different conditions. There are two types of vertigo, known as peripheral and central, depending on the cause. \n Peripheral vertigo \n Peripheral vertigo is the most common type,\u00a0often caused by a problem with the balance mechanisms of the inner ear. The most common causes include: \n \n benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) \n head injury \n labyrinthitis \n vestibular neuronitis \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n taking\u00a0certain types of medication \n \n These\u00a0causes\u00a0are explained in more detail below. \n Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) \n This is one of the most common causes of vertigo.\u00a0It can\u00a0occur during specific head movements, while standing up or bending over, crossing the road, or turning in bed. \n BPPV involves short, intense, recurrent attacks of vertigo (usually lasting a few seconds to a few minutes). It is often accompanied by nausea, although vomiting is rare.\u00a0You may\u00a0also\u00a0experience your eyes briefly moving\u00a0uncontrollably (nystagmus).\u00a0 \n Lightheadedness and a loss of balance can last for several minutes or hours after the attack. \n BPPV is thought to be caused by small fragments of debris (calcium carbonate crystals), which break off from the lining of the channels in your inner ear. The fragments don't usually cause a problem, unless they get into one of the ear's fluid-filled canals. \n When your head is still, the fragments sit at the bottom of the canal. However, certain head movements cause them to be swept along the fluid-filled canal, which sends confusing messages to your brain, causing vertigo. \n BPPV usually affects older people, with most cases occurring in people older than 50 years of age. \n BPPV may occur for no apparent reason, or it may develop after: \n \n an ear infection \n ear surgery \n a head injury \n prolonged bed rest \u2013 for example, while recovering from an illness \n \n Head injury \n Vertigo can sometimes develop after a head injury. If you have symptoms of\u00a0dizziness or vertigo following a head injury, seek medical attention. \n Read more about  severe head injuries  and  minor head injuries  \n Labyrinthitis \n  Labyrinthitis \u00a0is an inner ear infection that causes a structure deep inside your ear (the labyrinth) to become inflamed. The labyrinth is a maze of fluid-filled channels that control hearing and balance. \n When the labyrinth becomes inflamed, the information it sends to your brain is different from the information sent from your unaffected ear and your eyes. These conflicting signals cause vertigo and dizziness. \n Labyrinthitis is usually caused by a viral infection, such as the\u00a0 common cold  or  flu , which spreads to the labyrinth. Less commonly, it's caused by a bacterial infection. \n Vertigo\u00a0caused by labyrinthitis may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting,\u00a0 hearing loss , tinnitus and sometimes\u00a0a high temperature and ear pain. \n Vestibular neuronitis \n Vestibular neuronitis, also known as vestibular neuritis, is an inner ear condition that causes inflammation of the nerve connecting the labyrinth to the brain. In some cases, the labyrinth itself can also be inflamed. \n The condition\u00a0is usually caused by a viral infection. It usually comes on suddenly and can cause other symptoms, such as unsteadiness, nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being sick). You won't normally have any hearing problems. \n It usually lasts a few hours or days, but it may take\u00a0three to\u00a0six weeks to settle completely. \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n Severe vertigo is sometimes caused by a rare condition that affects the inner ear, called  M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease .\u00a0This\u00a0can cause vertigo, as well as hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness (a feeling of pressure in your ear). \n If you have M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you may experience sudden attacks of vertigo that last\u00a0for hours or days. The attacks often cause nausea and vomiting. \n The cause is unknown, but\u00a0symptoms can be controlled by diet and medication. Rarely, you may need further treatment in the form of surgery.\u00a0 \n Medication \n Vertigo may occur as a side effect of some types of medication. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if vertigo is listed as a possible side effect. \n Don't stop taking prescribed medication without your doctor's advice, but speak to your GP if you're worried about the side effects. They may be able to prescribe an alternative medication. \n Central vertigo \n Central vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord). Causes of central vertigo include: \n \n  migraines  \u2013 a severe headache that's usually felt as a throbbing pain at the front or on one side of your head, which is especially common in younger people \n  multiple sclerosis  \u2013 a condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) \n acoustic neuroma \u2013 a rare, non-cancerous (benign) brain tumour that grows on the acoustic nerve, which is the nerve that helps to control hearing and balance \n a  brain tumour  in the cerebellum, located at the bottom of the brain \n a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or a  stroke  \u2013 where part of the blood supply to the brain is cut off \n taking certain types of medication", "treatment": "Treatment for vertigo depends on the cause and severity of your symptoms. \n During a vertigo attack, lying still in a quiet, darkened room may help to ease any symptoms of nausea and reduce the sensation of spinning. You may be advised to take medication. \n You should also try to avoid stressful situations, as anxiety can make the symptoms of vertigo worse. \n Read more about\u00a0what to do if you're  struggling with stress  \n Labyrinthitis \n  Labyrinthitis  is an inner ear infection that causes the labyrinth (a delicate structure deep inside your ear) to become inflamed. It's usually caused by a viral infection and clears up on its own without treatment. In rare cases, where labyrinthitis is caused by a bacterial infection,\u00a0 antibiotics  may be prescribed. \n If you've experienced any hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiovestibular physician. This is a doctor who specialises in hearing and balance disorders. You may need emergency treatment to restore your hearing. \n Labyrinthitis may also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation\u00a0\u2013 also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT (see below). \n See  treating labyrinthitis  for more information \n Vestibular neuronitis \n Vestibular neuronitis, also known as vestibular neuritis, is inflammation of the vestibular nerve (one of the nerves in your ear that's used for balance). It's usually caused by a viral infection. \n The symptoms of vestibular neuronitis\u00a0often get better without treatment\u00a0over several weeks. However, you may need to rest in bed if your symptoms are severe. See your GP if your symptoms get worse or don't start to improve after a week. \n You may find your balance is particularly affected if you: \n \n drink alcohol \n are tired \n have another illness \n \n Avoiding these can help to improve your condition. \n Vestibular neuronitis can also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation and medication. \n Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) \n Like vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) often clears up without treatment after several weeks or months. It's thought that the small fragments of debris in the ear canal that cause vertigo either dissolve or become lodged in a place where they\u00a0no longer\u00a0cause symptoms.\u00a0BPPV can sometimes return. \n Until the symptoms disappear or the condition is treated, you should: \n \n get out of bed slowly \n avoid activities that involve looking upwards, such as painting and decorating or looking for something on a high shelf \n \n BPPV can be treated using a procedure called the Epley manoeuvre. \n The Epley manoeuvre \n The Epley manoeuvre involves performing four separate head movements to move the fragments that cause vertigo\u00a0to a place where they no longer\u00a0cause symptoms. Each head position is held for at least 30 seconds. You may experience some vertigo during the movements. \n Your symptoms should improve shortly after the Epley manoeuvre is performed, although it may take up to two weeks for a complete recovery. Return to your GP if your symptoms haven't improved after four weeks. The Epley manoeuvre isn't usually a long-term cure and may need to\u00a0be repeated. \n Brandt-Daroff exercises \n If the Epley manoeuvre doesn't work, or if it's not suitable \u2013 for example, because you have neck or back problems\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you can also\u00a0try Brandt-Daroff exercises. These are a series of movements\u00a0you can do unsupervised at home. \n Your GP will need to teach you how to do the exercises. You repeat them three or four times a day for two days in a row. Your symptoms may improve for up to two weeks. \n Referral to a specialist \n Your GP may refer you to a specialist, such as an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if: \n \n the Epley manoeuvre doesn't work or can't be performed \n you still have symptoms after four weeks \n you have unusual signs or symptoms \n \n In rare cases, where the symptoms of vertigo last for months or years, surgery may be recommended. This may involve blocking one of the fluid-filled canals in your ear. Your ENT specialist\u00a0can give more advice on this. \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n If your vertigo is caused by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, there are a number of treatment options\u00a0for both the vertigo and other symptoms caused by the condition. \n Possible treatments for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease include: \n \n dietary advice\u00a0\u2013 particularly a low-salt diet \n medication to treat attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n medication to prevent attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n treatment for\u00a0 tinnitus  (ringing in your ears)\u00a0\u2013 such as sound therapy,\u00a0which works by reducing the difference between tinnitus sounds and background sounds, to make the tinnitus sounds less intrusive \n treatment for  hearing loss \u00a0\u2013 such as using hearing aids \n physiotherapy to deal with balance problems \n treatment for the secondary symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\u00a0\u2013 such as stress, anxiety and depression \n \n See  treating M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease  for more information \n Central vertigo \n Central vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (which is located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord). \n Causes of central vertigo include\u00a0 migraines  and, less commonly,\u00a0 brain tumours . \n If your GP suspects\u00a0you have central vertigo, they may organise a\u00a0scan or refer you to a hospital specialist,\u00a0such as a neurologist or an ENT (ear, nose and throat specialist) or audiovestibular physician. \n Treating your migraine should relieve your vertigo if it's caused by a migraine. \n Vertigo with an unknown cause \n If the cause of your vertigo is unknown, you may be admitted to hospital if: \n \n you have severe nausea and vomiting, and can't keep fluids down \n your vertigo comes on suddenly and wasn't caused by you changing position \n you possibly have central vertigo \n you have sudden hearing loss, but it's not thought to be M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n \n Alternatively, you may be referred to a specialist, such as: \n \n a neurologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system \n an ENT specialist \u2013 a specialist in conditions that affect the ear, nose or throat \n an audiovestibular physician \u2013 a specialist in hearing and balance disorders \n \n While waiting to see a specialist, you may be treated with medication.\u00a0 \n Vestibular rehabilitation \n Vestibular rehabilitation, also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT, is a form of \"brain retraining\". It involves carrying out a special programme of exercises that encourage your brain to adapt to the abnormal messages sent from your ears. \n During VRT, you keep moving despite feelings of dizziness and vertigo. Your brain should eventually learn to rely on the signals coming from the rest of your body, such as your eyes and legs, rather than the confusing signals coming from your inner ear. By relying on other signals, your brain minimises any dizziness and helps you to maintain your balance. \n An audiologist (hearing specialist) or a physiotherapist\u00a0may provide VRT. Your GP may be able to refer you for VRT, although it depends on availability in your\u00a0area. \n In some cases,\u00a0it\u00a0may be possible to\u00a0use VRT without specialist help. Research has shown that\u00a0people with some types of vertigo can improve their symptoms using a self-help\u00a0VRT booklet. However, you should discuss this with your doctor first. \n Medicines \n Medication can be used to treat\u00a0episodes of vertigo caused by vestibular neuronitis\u00a0or\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. It may also be used for central vertigo or vertigo with an unknown cause. \n The medicines are usually prescribed for\u00a03\u00a0to 14 days, depending on which condition they're for. The two medicines that are usually prescribed are: \n \n prochlorperazine \n antihistamines \n \n If these medicines are successful in treating your symptoms, you may be given a supply to keep at home, so you can take them the next time you have an episode of vertigo. \n In some cases you may be advised to take long-term medication, such as betahistine, for conditions like M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. \n Prochlorperazine \n Prochlorperazine can help relieve\u00a0severe nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo. It works by blocking the effect of a chemical in the brain called dopamine. \n Prochlorperazine can cause side effects, including tremors (shaking) and abnormal or involuntary body and facial movements. \n It can also make some people feel sleepy. For the full list of possible side effects, check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines can be used to help relieve less severe nausea, vomiting and vertigo symptoms. They work by blocking the effects of a\u00a0chemical called histamine. \n Possible antihistamines that may be prescribed include: \n \n cinnarizine \n cyclizine \n promethazine teoclate \n \n Like prochlorperazine, antihistamines can also make you feel sleepy. Headaches and an upset stomach are also possible side effects. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects. \n A medication called betahistine works in a similar way to antihistamines. It has been used to treat M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and may also be used for other balance problems. It may have to be taken for a long period of time. The beneficial effects vary from person to person. \n Safety \n If you have vertigo, there are some safety issues\u00a0to consider. For example: \n \n you should inform your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders \n you may be at increased risk of falls \u2013 see  preventing falls  for advice\u00a0on making your home safer and reducing your risk \n \n Vertigo could also affect your ability to drive. You should avoid driving if you've recently had episodes of vertigo and there's a chance you may have another episode while you're driving. \n It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could affect your driving ability. Visit the GOV.UK website for more information on  driving with a disability .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will ask about your symptoms and carry out some simple tests to help them make an accurate diagnosis. \n In some cases, you may be referred for some further tests. \n Important questions \n Your GP will first want to know: \n \n details of the first episode of your symptoms and what they were\u00a0\u2013 for example, whether you felt lightheaded or if your surroundings were spinning \n if you also experience other symptoms\u00a0\u2013 such as hearing loss, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting or fullness in the ear \n how often your symptoms occur and how long they last for \n if your symptoms are affecting your daily activities \u2013 for example, whether you're unable to walk during an episode of vertigo \n whether anything triggers your symptoms or makes them worse, such as moving your head in a particular direction \n what makes your symptoms better\u00a0 \n \n Physical examination \n Your GP may also carry out a physical examination to check for signs of conditions that may be causing your vertigo. This could include looking inside your ears and checking your eyes for signs of uncontrollable movement (nystagmus). \n Your GP may check your balance or try to recreate your symptoms by asking you to move quickly from a sitting to a lying position. \n Further tests \n Depending on your symptoms, your GP\u00a0may refer you\u00a0to a hospital or specialist for further tests. \n Hearing tests \n If you have\u00a0 tinnitus  (ringing in your ears) or hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, who can carry out\u00a0some hearing tests. \n These\u00a0may include: \n \n an audiometry test \u2013 a machine called an audiometer produces sounds of different volume and pitch. You listen to the sounds through headphones and signal when you hear a sound, either by raising your hand or pressing a button. \n tuning fork test \u2013 a tuning fork produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it's gently tapped. The tester will tap the tuning fork before holding it at each side of your head. \n \n Read more\u00a0about how hearing tests are carried out. \n Videonystagmography\u00a0 \n Videonystagmography (VNG)\u00a0is sometimes\u00a0used to check for signs of nystagmus in more detail. Nystagmus can\u00a0indicate\u00a0a problem with\u00a0the organs that help you to balance. \n During this test, special goggles are placed over your eyes and you'll be asked to look at various still and moving targets. The goggles are fitted with a video camera to record the movements of your eyes. \n Electronystagmography may also be used, where electrodes are placed around the eye instead of goggles. \n Caloric testing \n A\u00a0caloric test\u00a0involves running warm or cool water or air into your ear for about 30 seconds.\u00a0The change in temperature stimulates the balance organ in the ear,\u00a0allowing the specialist to check how well it's working. \n This test isn't painful, although it's normal to\u00a0feel dizzy during the test. This can sometimes continue for a\u00a0few\u00a0minutes afterwards. \n Posturography \n A machine to test your balance may be used to give valuable information about how you are using your vision, proprioception (sensations from your feet and joints) and\u00a0the input from your ear to maintain balance. This may help to plan your rehabilitation and\u00a0monitor your treatment. \n Scans \n In some cases, a scan of your head may be used to look for the cause of your vertigo, such as an acoustic neuroma (a non-cancerous brain tumour). \n Usually, either\u00a0a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  or\u00a0a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  is used. An MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your head, whereas\u00a0a CT scan uses a series of\u00a0detailed  X-rays  to create an image."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Varicose eczema", "introduction": "Varicose eczema is a long-term skin condition that affects the lower legs and is common in people with  varicose veins . \n It\u00a0is\u00a0also known as venous eczema, gravitational eczema and\u00a0stasis eczema. \n Signs and symptoms \n Like all types of eczema,\u00a0the affected skin becomes: \n \n itchy \n red and\u00a0swollen \n dry and\u00a0flaky\u00a0 \n scaly or crusty \n \n There may be periods\u00a0when these symptoms\u00a0improve and periods when they become more severe. \n Your legs may become swollen, especially towards the end of the day or after long periods of standing. Varicose veins (swollen and enlarged veins) are often visible on the legs. \n Some people also have other symptoms, such as: \n \n brown discolouration of the skin \n red, tender and tight skin that can eventually become hardened (lipodermatosclerosis) \n small, white scars (atrophie blanche) \n pain \n eczema affecting other parts of the body \n \n Left untreated,\u00a0 leg ulcers \u00a0can develop.

They will\u00a0often be able to make a diagnosis simply by looking at the skin. \n Read more about  diagnosing varicose eczema . \n What causes varicose eczema?\u00a0 \n Varicose eczema is caused by increased pressure in the leg veins. \n When the small valves in the veins stop working properly, it's difficult for blood to be pushed against gravity and it\u00a0can leak\u00a0backwards. \n This increases the\u00a0pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid. \n Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins aren\u2019t working properly. \n Read more about the  causes of varicose eczema . \n How varicose eczema is treated \n Varicose eczema tends to be a long-term\u00a0problem. However, treatments are available to help keep\u00a0it under control. \n For most people, treatment involves a combination of: \n \n self-help measures \u2013 including ways to improve your circulation, such as keeping active and frequently raising your legs \n emollients \u2013 moisturisers applied to the skin to stop it becoming dry) \n  topical corticosteroids  \u2013 ointments and creams applied to the skin to help treat the eczema and relieve symptoms \n compression stockings \u2013 specially designed stockings, usually worn every day, that steadily squeeze your legs and help to improve your circulation \n \n If these treatments don\u2019t help, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) in case there is another cause for your symptoms or if they are concerned you may also have a type of eczema called contact dermatitis. \n If you also have varicose veins, you may be referred to a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) who can talk to you about the  treatment options for varicose veins . \n Read\u00a0more about\u00a0 treating varicose eczema .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Varicose eczema is usually caused by increased pressure in your leg veins. \n Inside your veins there are\u00a0valves that let the blood through in one direction and prevent it flowing backwards. \n Sometimes, the walls of the veins can become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to become weakened. If the valves do not function properly,\u00a0blood may leak backwards. \n This\u00a0increases the pressure in your veins, which may cause fluid to leak into surrounding tissues. It is thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of your immune system reacting to these fluids in the tissues under your skin. \n This increase in pressure can also cause blood to collect in your veins, which become swollen and enlarged ( varicose veins ). \n Who's\u00a0most at risk? \n It is not fully understood why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves weaken.\u00a0Some\u00a0people develop the condition\u00a0for no obvious reason, although there are certain\u00a0factors that increase the chances of this happening, including: \n \n gender \u2013 varicose eczema is more common in women \n  obesity  \u2013 this can increase the pressure in your leg veins \n pregnancy\u00a0\u2013 this can also\u00a0increase the pressure in your\u00a0leg veins \n not being able to move for a long period of time \u2013 this can affect the circulation in\u00a0your leg veins \n having previously had  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  \u2013\u00a0blood clots that develop in\u00a0leg veins, which can damage the\u00a0valves in your veins \n increasing age \u2013 people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation", "treatment": "Treatment for varicose eczema aims to improve the condition of your skin, treat your symptoms and help improve your circulation (blood flow). \n For many people, this will involve long-term treatment with a combination of: \n \n emollients (moisturisers)\u00a0 \n  topical corticosteroids  \n compression stockings \n \n There are also some self-help techniques that you can try. These treatment options are described in more detail below. \n Lipodermatosclerosis (hardened,\u00a0tight skin) is treated in a similar way to varicose eczema. If you have a  venous leg ulcer , you can also\u00a0read about  treating venous leg ulcers . \n Self-help \n There are some steps you can take to reduce the symptoms of varicose eczema and help prevent further problems, such as: \n \n try to avoid injuring your skin \u2013\u00a0injuries to your skin could lead to an ulcer\u00a0developing \n raise your legs when you are resting \u2013\u00a0for example, by propping up your feet on some pillows\u00a0(ideally so that they are above the level of your heart), as this can help reduce swelling\u00a0 \n keep physically active\u00a0\u2013 this will improve your circulation and\u00a0help you maintain a healthy weight \n \n Fluid\u00a0can build up\u00a0in the lower legs if you sit or stand for too long, so it is important to keep moving. Walking will get your muscles working and help to push the blood through the veins to your heart. \n The\u00a0 National Eczema Society  also recommends regularly flexing your feet and rising up onto your toes or bending down at the knees. \n Emollients \n Emollients are\u00a0moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film.\u00a0They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema. \n Choice of emollient \n A\u00a0number of different emollients are available. Some can be bought over the counter without a prescription, but if you have varicose eczema it may be helpful to ask your GP\u00a0to recommend a suitable product. \n You may need to try several different emollients to find one that works for you. You may also be prescribed a mixture of emollients, for example: \n \n an ointment for very dry skin\u00a0 \n a cream or lotion for less dry skin \n an emollient to use instead of soap\u00a0 \n an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower \n \n The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil that\u00a0they contain. Ointments contain the most oil, so they can be quite greasy, but\u00a0are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of\u00a0oil, so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. \n How to use emollients \n If you have varicose eczema, you should use\u00a0an emollient at least twice a day, even if you do not have any symptoms. \n To apply the emollient: \n \n use a large amount\u00a0\u2013 you should aim to cover all of the skin on your lower leg, not just the obviously affected areas \n don't rub it in\u00a0\u2013\u00a0instead, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows \n apply\u00a0every 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0hours for very dry skin\u00a0 \n after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin, then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist\u00a0 \n do not share emollients with other people \n \n It is very important to keep using emollients during a flare-up of varicose eczema, because this is when the skin needs the most moisture.\u00a0Apply emollients frequently and in generous amounts during a flare-up. \n Side effects \n It\u2019s unusual for emollients to cause side effects, but they can occasionally cause a rash, and greasy emollients may sometimes cause folliculitis (inflammation of the hair follicles). If you experience any side effects from your emollient, speak to your GP, who can prescribe an alternative product. \n Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Topical corticosteroids \n If your skin is inflamed from a flare-up of varicose eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin in the form of a cream or ointment) to quickly reduce the inflammation. They are also commonly known as topical steroids. \n Different strength topical corticosteroids can be prescribed, depending on the severity of your varicose eczema. If you have flare-ups of lipodermatosclerosis, you may need a very strong topical corticosteroid. \n How to use topical corticosteroids \n When using corticosteroids, only apply the treatment to the affected areas. Your doctor can advise you\u00a0on how much to apply and how often. You can also check the advice in the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. \n Most people only have to apply a topical corticosteroid once a day. When applying the medication, you should: \n \n apply your emollient first and wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid (until the emollient has soaked into your skin) \n apply it only to the affected area \n use the topical corticosteroid for\u00a07 to 14 days and continue to apply the treatment for 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared \n \n If your varicose eczema is moderate to severe, you may need to apply topical corticosteroids both between flare-ups and during them. \n If you need to use topical corticosteroids on a long-term basis, you should apply them less frequently. Your GP will advise you\u00a0on how often you should be applying them. \n You should also speak to your GP if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved. \n Side effects \n Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them, particularly if using a cream. \n Generally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for prolonged periods will increase your risk of getting more serious side effects, such as thinning of the skin. Your doctor will advise you as to the strength of the medication you require and when you should use it. \n Compression stockings \n Medical compression stockings are specially designed to steadily squeeze your legs to help improve your circulation. They are tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. This encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart. \n Medical compression stockings are used to treat varicose eczema and lipodermatosclerosis by improving the flow of blood through your leg veins and reducing the pressure in the veins. \n Choice of compression stockings \n Compression stockings are available in a variety of different sizes and pressures. They are also available in: \n \n different colours \n different lengths \u2013 some come up to the knee and others also cover the thigh (you should only need knee-high stockings for varicose eczema) \n different foot styles \u2013 some cover the whole foot and some stop before the toes \n \n Support stockings or tights that lightly compress the legs can be bought from pharmacies. Compression stockings that compress the legs more are available on prescription and will require you to be measured by a nurse first. \n In some cases, if you find it difficult to put on your stockings, you may be advised to use a tubular bandage instead. \n Wearing compression stockings \n You will usually need to put your compression stockings on as soon as you get up in the morning and take them off when you go to bed. Wearing compression stockings can be uncomfortable, particularly during hot weather, but it is important to wear them correctly to get the most benefit from them. \n Pull them all the way up so that the correct level of compression is applied to each part of your leg. Do not let the stocking roll down, or it may dig into your skin in a tight band around your leg. Speak to your GP if the stockings are uncomfortable, they do not seem to fit, or you have difficulty putting them on. It may be possible to get custom-made stockings that will fit you exactly. \n Take care when\u00a0putting compression stockings on and taking them off,\u00a0as this\u00a0can damage fragile skin. If you have a leg ulcer, it ideally needs to heal before you start wearing compression stockings.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Caring for compression stockings \n Compression stockings usually have to be replaced every 3\u00a0to 6\u00a0months. Speak to your GP if your stockings become damaged, as they may no longer be effective.\u00a0   \u00a0  You should be prescribed 2\u00a0stockings (or 2\u00a0sets of stockings if you are wearing 1\u00a0on each leg) so that 1\u00a0stocking can be worn while the other is being washed and dried. Compression stockings should be hand-washed in warm water and dried away from direct heat. \n Treating varicose veins \n If you have  varicose veins ,\u00a0as well as\u00a0varicose eczema, treating these may sometimes be helpful. \n If your GP thinks treatment may be beneficial, they can refer you to a vascular surgeon, who can arrange for an  ultrasound scan  of your leg to find the faulty blood vessels. Treatment of your varicose veins can then be planned. \n There are a number of treatments available that can improve the symptoms and appearance of varicose veins, including: \n \n endothermal ablation \u2013\u00a0where energy from either high-frequency radio waves or lasers is used\u00a0to seal the affected veins \n sclerotherapy \u2013 where a\u00a0special foam is injected\u00a0into your veins to seal them \n ligation and stripping \u2013 where affected veins are tied off and surgically removed \n \n These procedures are usually performed in the day surgery department of a hospital. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating varicose veins .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you have symptoms of varicose eczema. They can usually make a diagnosis by simply looking at the affected areas. \n Your GP will also ask you questions to determine whether you have a problem with the flow of blood in your leg veins, as this is the main cause of varicose eczema. \n To help make a diagnosis, your GP may want to know if you have a history of: \n \n  varicose veins \u00a0\u2013 swollen and enlarged veins \n  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  \u2013\u00a0a blood clot in one of the deep veins of your legs \n  leg ulcers \u00a0\u2013\u00a0areas of damaged skin that take several weeks to heal \n  cellulitis \u00a0\u2013 an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue \n surgery or injury to your legs \n \n Your GP may also check the pulse in your feet and they may carry out an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) test to see if compression stockings are suitable for you. See the section on\u00a0 treating varicose eczema  for more information about these. \n The ABPI test involves comparing blood pressure readings taken from your ankles and upper arms. A significant difference in the readings suggests a problem with the flow of blood in your arteries\u00a0\u2013 in which case, compression stockings may not be safe to use. \n Referral to a specialist \n You may be referred to a specialist in a local hospital for further tests. This might be\u00a0a vascular specialist (a doctor or surgeon\u00a0specialising in conditions affecting the blood vessels) or a dermatologist (a specialist in skin conditions) if: \n \n you have varicose veins and changes to your skin, such as varicose eczema, lipodermatosclerosis (hard, tightened skin) or a history of\u00a0leg ulcers \n you have very poor blood flow in the blood vessels in your legs\u00a0 \n your symptoms don't get better, despite treatment\u00a0 \n it is possible that you may have\u00a0contact dermatitis"},

Then, depending on whether your B12 deficiency is related to your diet, you'll either require B12 tablets between meals\u00a0or regular injections. These treatments may be needed for the rest of your life. \n Folic acid tablets are used to restore folate levels. These usually need to be taken for four months. \n In some cases, improving your diet can help treat the condition and prevent it recurring. Vitamin B12 is found in meat, fish, eggs,\u00a0dairy products, yeast extract (such as Marmite) and specially fortified foods.

The longer the condition goes untreated, the higher the chance of permanent damage.", "causes": "Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia occurs when a lack of either of these vitamins affects the body's ability to produce fully functioning red blood cells. \n Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. Most people with\u00a0vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia have underdeveloped red blood cells that are\u00a0larger than normal. The medical term for this is \"megaloblastic anaemia\". \n A vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can be the result of a variety of problems, some of which are described below. \n Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency \n Pernicious anaemia \n Pernicious anaemia is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK. \n Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition that affects your stomach. An autoimmune condition means\u00a0your\u00a0immune system (the body's natural defence system that protects against illness and infection) attacks your body's healthy cells. \n In your stomach, vitamin B12\u00a0is combined with\u00a0a\u00a0protein called intrinsic factor. This mix of vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor is then absorbed into the body in part of the gut called the distal ileum. \n Pernicious anaemia causes your immune system to attack the cells in your stomach that produce the intrinsic factor, which means\u00a0your body is unable to absorb vitamin B12. \n The exact cause\u00a0of pernicious anaemia is unknown, but the condition is more common in\u00a0women around 60 years of age, people with a family history of the condition and those with another autoimmune condition, such as\u00a0 Addison's disease  or\u00a0vitiligo. \n Diet \n Some people can develop a vitamin B12 deficiency as a result of not getting enough vitamin B12 from their diet. \n A diet that includes meat, fish and dairy products usually provides enough vitamin B12, but people who don't regularly eat these foods \u2013 such as those following a\u00a0vegan diet or who have\u00a0a generally\u00a0very poor diet \u2013 can become deficient. \n Stores of vitamin B12 in the body can\u00a0last\u00a0around two to four years without being replenished, so it can take a long time for\u00a0any problems to develop after a dietary change. \n Conditions affecting the stomach \n Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can prevent the absorption of\u00a0enough vitamin B12. \n For example, a\u00a0gastrectomy (a surgical procedure where part of your stomach is removed) increases your risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency. \n Conditions affecting the intestines \n Some conditions that affect your intestines\u00a0can also\u00a0stop you from absorbing the necessary amount of vitamin B12. \n For example,  Crohn's disease \u00a0(a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes mean your body doesn't\u00a0get enough vitamin B12. \n Medication \n Some types of medicine can lead to a reduction in\u00a0the amount of vitamin B12 in your body. \n For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \u2013 a medication sometimes used to\u00a0treat indigestion \u2013 can make a vitamin B12 deficiency worse. PPIs inhibit the production of stomach acid, which is needed to release vitamin B12 from the food you eat. \n Your GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your vitamin B12 levels and will monitor you if necessary. \n Functional vitamin B12 deficiency \n Some people can experience problems related to a vitamin B12 deficiency, despite appearing to have normal levels of vitamin B12 in their blood. \n This can occur due to a problem known as functional vitamin B12 deficiency \u2013 where there's a problem with the proteins that help transport vitamin B12 between cells. This results in\u00a0neurological complications involving the spinal cord. \n Causes of folate deficiency \n Folate dissolves in water, which means your body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Your body's store of folate is usually enough to last four months. This means you need folate in your daily diet to ensure your body has sufficient stores of the vitamin. \n Like vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia can develop for a number of reasons. Some are described below. \n Diet \n Good\u00a0sources of folate include\u00a0broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas and brown rice. If you don't regularly eat these types of foods, you may develop a folate deficiency. \n Folate deficiency caused by a lack of dietary folate is more common in people who have a generally unbalanced and unhealthy diet, people who regularly misuse alcohol and people following a fad diet that doesn't involve eating good sources of folate. \n Malabsorption \n Sometimes your body may be unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually due to an underlying condition affecting your digestive system, such as\u00a0 coeliac disease . \n Excessive urination \n You may lose folate from your body if you urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of your organs, such as: \n \n congestive  heart failure  \u2013 where the heart is unable to pump enough blood around the body \n acute liver damage \u2013 often caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol \n long-term\u00a0 dialysis  \u2013 where a machine that replicates the kidney function is used to filter waste products from the blood \n \n Medication \n Some types of medicine reduce the amount of folate in your body, or make the folate harder to absorb. \n These include some\u00a0anticonvulsants (medication used to treat epilepsy), colestyramine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate. \n Your GP will be aware of medicines that can affect your folate levels and will monitor you if necessary. \n Other causes \n Your body sometimes requires more folate than normal. This can cause folate deficiency\u00a0if you can't meet your body's demands for the vitamin. \n Your body may need more folate than usual if you: \n \n are pregnant (see below) \n have cancer \n have a blood disorder \u2013 such as\u00a0 sickle cell anaemia  (an inherited blood disorder which causes red blood cells to develop abnormally) \n are fighting an infection or health condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) \n \n Premature babies (born before the 37th week\u00a0of pregnancy) are also more\u00a0likely to develop a folate deficiency, because their developing bodies require higher amounts of folate than normal. \n Pregnancy \n If you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, it's recommended that you take a 400 microgram folic acid tablet every day until you're 12 weeks pregnant. This will ensure that both you and your baby have enough folate and help your baby grow and develop. \n Folic acid tablets are available with a prescription from your GP, or you can buy them over the counter from pharmacies, large supermarkets and health food stores. \n If you're pregnant and have another condition that may increase your body's need for folate, such as those mentioned above, your GP will monitor you closely to prevent you from becoming anaemic. \n In some cases, you may need a higher dose of folic acid. For example, if you have diabetes, you should take a 5 milligrams (5mg) supplement of folic acid instead of the standard 400 micrograms. \n Read more about  vitamins and nutrition in pregnancy", "treatment": "The treatment for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia depends on what's causing the condition. Most people can be easily treated with injections or tablets to replace the missing vitamins. \n Treating vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia \n Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is usually treated with injections of vitamin B12, in a form called hydroxocobalamin. \n At first, you'll have these injections every other day for two weeks, or until your symptoms have stopped improving. Your GP or nurse will give the injections. \n After this initial\u00a0period, your\u00a0treatment will depend on whether the cause of your vitamin B12 deficiency is related to your diet. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK is pernicious anaemia, which isn't related to your diet. \n Read more about the  causes of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency  \n Diet-related \n If your vitamin B12 deficiency is caused by a lack of the vitamin in your diet, you may be prescribed vitamin B12 tablets to take every day between meals. Alternatively, you may need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin twice a year. \n People who find it difficult to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets, such as\u00a0those following a vegan diet, may need vitamin B12 tablets for life. \n Although it's less common, people\u00a0with vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a prolonged poor diet may be advised\u00a0to stop taking the tablets once their vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal and\u00a0their diet has improved. \n Good sources of vitamin B12 include: \n \n meat \n salmon and cod \n milk and other dairy products \n eggs \n \n If you're a vegetarian and vegan, or\u00a0are looking for alternatives to meat and dairy products, there are other foods that contain vitamin B12, such as yeast extract (including Marmite), as well as some fortified breakfast cereals and soy products. \n Check the nutrition labels while food shopping to see how much vitamin B12\u00a0different foods contain. \n Not diet-related \n If your vitamin B12 deficiency isn't caused by a lack of vitamin B12 in your diet, you'll usually need to have an injection of hydroxocobalamin every three months for the rest of your life. \n If you've had neurological symptoms (symptoms that affect your nervous system, such as numbness\u00a0or tingling in your hands and feet) caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency, you'll be referred to a haematologist, and you may need to have injections every two months. Your haematologist will advise\u00a0on\u00a0how long you need to keep taking the injections. \n For\u00a0injections of vitamin B12 given in the UK, hydroxocobalamin is preferred to an alternative called cyanocobalamin. This is because hydroxocobalamin stays in the body for longer. \n If you need regular injections of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin\u00a0would need to be given once a month, whereas hydroxocobalamin can be given every three months. \n Cyanocobalamin injections aren't routinely available on the NHS. However, if you need replacement tablets of vitamin B12, these will be cyanocobalamin. \n Treating folate deficiency anaemia \n To treat folate deficiency anaemia, your GP will usually prescribe daily folic acid\u00a0tablets to build up your folate levels. They may also give you\u00a0dietary advice so you can increase your folate intake. \n Good sources of folate include: \n \n broccoli \n Brussels sprouts \n asparagus \n peas \n chickpeas \n brown rice \n \n Most people need to take folic acid tablets for about four months. However, if the underlying cause of your folate deficiency anaemia continues, you may have to take folic acid tablets for longer \u2013 possibly for life. \n Before you start taking folic acid, your GP will check your vitamin B12 levels to make sure they're normal. This is because folic acid treatment can sometimes improve your symptoms so much that it masks an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency. \n If a vitamin B12 deficiency isn't detected and treated, it could affect your nervous system. \n Monitoring your condition \n To ensure your treatment is working, you may need to have further\u00a0 blood tests . \n A\u00a0blood test is often carried out around 10-14 days after starting treatment to assess whether treatment is working. This\u00a0is to check your haemoglobin level and the number of the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) in your blood. \n Another blood test may also be carried out after approximately eight weeks to confirm your treatment has been successful. \n If you've been taking folic acid tablets, you may be tested again once the treatment has finished (usually after four months). \n Most people who have had a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency won't need further monitoring unless their symptoms return, or their treatment is ineffective. If your GP feels\u00a0it's necessary, you may have to return for an annual blood test to see whether your condition has returned.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "A diagnosis of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia can often be made by your GP based on your symptoms and the results of blood tests. \n Blood tests \n Different types of\u00a0 blood tests  can be carried out to\u00a0help identify people with a possible\u00a0vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These tests check: \n \n whether you have a lower level of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen)\u00a0than normal \n whether your red blood cells are larger than normal \n the level of vitamin B12 in your blood \n the level\u00a0of\u00a0folate in your blood \n \n However, some people can have problems with their normal levels of these vitamins\u00a0or may\u00a0have low levels despite having no symptoms.\u00a0This is why it's important for your symptoms to be taken into account when a diagnosis is made. \n A particular drawback of testing vitamin B12 levels is that the current widely-used blood test only measures the total amount of vitamin B12 in your blood. \n This means\u00a0it measures\u00a0forms of vitamin B12 that are \"active\" and can be used by your body, as well as the \"inactive\" forms, which can't. If a significant amount of the vitamin B12 in your blood is \"inactive\", a blood test may show that you have normal B12 levels,\u00a0even though your body can't use much of it. \n There are some types of blood test that\u00a0may help determine if the vitamin B12 in your blood can be used by your body, but these aren't yet widely available. \n Identifying the cause \n If your symptoms and blood test results suggest a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, your GP may arrange further tests. If the cause can be identified,\u00a0it will\u00a0help\u00a0to determine the most appropriate treatment. \n For example,\u00a0you may have additional blood tests to check for a condition called pernicious anaemia. This is an autoimmune condition (where your immune system produces antibodies to attack healthy cells), which means you're unable to absorb vitamin B12 from the food you eat. \n Tests for pernicious anaemia aren't always conclusive, but they can often\u00a0give your GP a good idea of whether you have the condition. \n Referral to a specialist \n You may be referred to a specialist for further tests or treatment. This may include: \n \n a\u00a0haematologist (specialist in treating blood conditions) \u2013\u00a0if you have vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia and your GP is uncertain of the cause, you're pregnant or symptoms suggest your nervous system has been affected \n a\u00a0gastroenterologist (specialist in conditions that affect the digestive system) \u2013\u00a0if your GP suspects you don't have enough vitamin B12 or folate because your digestive system isn't absorbing it properly \n a\u00a0dietitian (specialist in nutrition) \u2013 if your GP suspects you\u00a0have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency caused by a poor diet \n \n A\u00a0dietitian can devise a personalised eating plan for you to increase the amount of vitamin B12 or folate in your diet."},

The blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves\u00a0that open and close to let blood through. \n If the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose). \n Certain things can increase your chances of developing varicose veins, such as: \n \n pregnancy \n being overweight \n old age \n \n Read more about the  causes of varicose veins . \n Who is affected? \n Varicose veins are a\u00a0common condition, affecting up to\u00a03 in 10 adults. Women are more likely to develop them than men. \n Any vein in the body can become varicose, but they most commonly develop in the legs and feet, particularly in the calves. This is because standing and walking puts extra pressure on the veins in the lower body. \n Treating varicose veins \n For most people, varicose veins don't present a serious health problem. They may have an unpleasant appearance, but\u00a0should not affect\u00a0circulation or cause\u00a0long-term health problems. Most varicose veins don't require any treatment. \n If treatment is necessary, your doctor may first\u00a0recommend up to six months of using compression stockings, taking regular exercise and elevating the affected area when resting. \n If\u00a0your varicose veins are still causing you pain or discomfort\u00a0\u2013 or they cause complications\u00a0\u2013 they can be treated in several ways, the most common being: \n \n endothermal ablation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0treatment where heat is used to seal affected veins \n sclerotherapy\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0uses special foam to close the veins \n ligation and stripping\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0involves surgery to remove the affected veins \n \n It's unlikely you'll receive treatment on the NHS for cosmetic reasons\u00a0\u2013 you'll have to pay for this privately. \n If you do feel you\u00a0require treatment, it might help if you\u00a0print out\u00a0treatment options for varicose veins to discuss with your GP. \n Read more about  treating varicose veins \u00a0and  complications of varicose veins . \n Preventing varicose veins \n There is little evidence to suggest\u00a0you can stop varicose veins getting worse, or completely prevent new ones developing. \n However,\u00a0there are ways\u00a0to ease\u00a0symptoms of existing varicose veins, such as: \n \n avoiding standing or sitting still for long periods and\u00a0trying to move around every 30 minutes \n taking regular breaks throughout the day, raising the legs on pillows while resting\u00a0to ease discomfort \n  exercising \u00a0regularly\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0can improve circulation and help maintain a healthy weight", "symptoms": "Varicose veins are dark purple or blue in colour and usually twisted and bulging in appearance. Some people with varicose veins may experience pain or discomfort. \n As well as their distinctive appearance,\u00a0symptoms of varicose veins can include: \n \n aching, heavy and uncomfortable legs \n swollen feet and ankles \n burning or throbbing in your legs \n  muscle cramp \u00a0in your legs, particularly at night \n dry, itchy and thin skin over the affected vein \n \n These symptoms are usually worse during warm weather or if you've been standing up for long periods of time. They may improve when you walk around or if you rest and raise your legs. Pillows are a good way to raise your legs comfortably. \n Varicose veins usually develop on the legs,\u00a0either on the back of your calf or on the inside of your leg. However, they can also sometimes occur in other parts of your body, such as your: \n \n gullet (oesophagus) \n womb (uterus) \n vagina \n pelvis \n rectum (back passage) \n \n If you are worried about the appearance of your veins, see your GP.", "causes": "Varicose veins are usually caused by weak vein walls and valves. \n Weakened valves \n Inside your veins are tiny one-way valves that open to let the blood through and then close to prevent it flowing backwards. \n Sometimes the walls of the veins become stretched and lose their elasticity, causing the valves to weaken. \n If the valves don't function properly,\u00a0this can cause the blood to leak and flow backwards. If this happens, the blood will collect in your veins, which will become swollen and enlarged. \n The reasons why the walls of the veins stretch and the valves in your veins weaken are not fully understood. Some people develop the condition for no obvious or apparent reason. \n Increased risk \n A\u00a0number of\u00a0things can increase your likelihood of developing varicose veins, including: \n \n gender \n genetics \n age \n being overweight \n occupation \n being pregnant \n other conditions \n \n Gender \n Women are more likely to be affected by varicose veins than men. Research suggests this may be because female hormones tend to relax the walls of veins, making the valves more prone to leaking. \n Hormones are chemicals produced by the body, and changes may be caused by pregnancy,\u00a0premenstrual syndrome\u00a0or the  menopause . \n Genetics \n Your risk of developing varicose veins is increased if a close family member has the condition. This suggests varicose veins may be partly caused by your genes (the units of genetic material\u00a0you inherit from your parents). \n Age \n As you get older, your veins start to lose their elasticity and the valves inside them stop working as well. \n Being overweight \n Being overweight puts extra pressure on your veins, which means they have to work harder to send the blood back to your heart. This can put increased pressure on the valves, making them more prone to leaking. \n The impact of body weight on the development of varicose veins appears to be more significant in women. \n Use a\u00a0 healthy weight calculator  to check whether you are overweight. \n Occupation \n Some research suggests jobs that require long periods of standing may increase your risk of getting varicose veins. This is because your blood does not flow as easily when you are standing for long periods of time. \n Pregnancy \n During pregnancy, the amount of blood increases to help support the developing baby. This puts extra strain on your veins. \n Increased hormone levels during pregnancy also cause the muscular walls of the blood vessels to relax, which also increases your risk. \n Varicose veins may also develop as the womb (uterus) begins to grow. As the womb expands it puts pressure on veins in your pelvic area, which can sometimes cause them to become varicose. \n Although being pregnant can increase your risk of developing varicose veins, most women find\u00a0their veins significantly improve after the baby is born. \n Other conditions \n In rare cases, varicose veins are caused by other conditions. These include: \n \n a previous blood clot \n a swelling or tumour in the pelvis \n abnormal blood vessels", "treatment": "Varicose veins don't always need treatment. If your varicose veins are not causing you discomfort, you may not need to have treatment. \n Treatment of varicose veins is usually necessary: \n \n to ease symptoms \u2013 if your varicose veins are causing you pain or discomfort \n to treat complications \u2013 such as  leg ulcers , swelling or skin discolouration \n for cosmetic reasons \u2013 but this kind of treatment is rarely available on the NHS, so you'll usually have to pay for it to be done privately \n \n If treatment is necessary, your doctor may first recommend up to six months of\u00a0self care at home, including:\u00a0 \n \n using compression stockings \n taking regular exercise \n avoiding standing up for long periods \n elevating the affected area when resting \n \n The various treatments for varicose veins are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Compression stockings \n Compression stockings are specially designed to steadily squeeze your legs to improve circulation. They are often tightest at the ankle and get gradually looser as they go further up your leg. This encourages blood to flow upwards towards your heart. \n Compression stockings may help relieve the pain, discomfort and swelling in your legs caused by your varicose veins. However, it's not known whether the stockings help prevent your varicose veins getting worse, or if they\u00a0prevent new varicose veins appearing. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) only recommends using compression stockings as a long-term treatment for varicose veins if all\u00a0other treatments are not suitable for you. \n If you are pregnant and you have varicose veins, NICE says you may be offered compression stockings for the duration of your pregnancy. \n Compression stockings are available in a variety of different sizes and pressures. Most people with varicose veins will be prescribed a class 1 (light compression) or class 2 (medium compression) stocking. They are also available in: \n \n different colours \n different lengths\u00a0\u2013\u00a0some come up to your knee, while others also cover your thigh \n different foot styles\u00a0\u2013 some cover your whole foot and some stop before your toes \n \n Compression tights are also available, but not on the NHS. They can be bought from pharmacies or directly from the manufacturers. \n You may need to wear compression stockings for the rest of your life if you have deep venous incompetence. Deep venous incompetence is where you have problems with the valves, or blockages, in the deep veins in your legs. \n In these circumstances, you will need to wear compression stockings even if you have had surgery to treat some varicose veins. \n Wearing compression stockings \n You usually need to put your compression stockings on as soon as you get up in the morning and take them off when you go to bed. \n They can be uncomfortable, particularly during hot weather, but it's important to wear your stockings correctly to get the most benefit from them. \n Pull them all the way up so the correct level of compression is applied to each part of your leg. Don't let the stocking roll down, or it may dig into your skin in a tight band around your leg. \n Speak to your GP if the stockings are uncomfortable or don't seem to fit. It may be possible to get custom-made stockings that will fit you exactly. \n If custom-made compression stockings are recommended, your legs will need to be measured in several places to ensure they are the correct size. If your legs are often swollen, they should be measured in the morning, when any swelling is likely to be minimal. \n If compression stockings are causing the skin on your legs to become dry, try applying a moisturising cream (emollient)\u00a0before you go to bed to keep your skin moist. \n You should also keep an eye out for sore marks on your legs, as well as blisters and discolouration. \n Caring for compression stockings \n Compression stockings usually have to be replaced every three to six months. If your stockings become damaged, speak to your GP because they may no longer be effective. \n You should be prescribed two stockings (or two sets of stockings if you are wearing one on each leg) so that one stocking can be worn while the other is being washed and dried. Compression stockings should be hand washed in warm water and dried away from direct heat. \n Further treatment \n If your varicose veins need further treatment, or if they are causing\u00a0complications,\u00a0the type of treatment will depend on your general health and the size, position and severity of your veins. \n A vascular specialist (a doctor who specialises in veins) will be able to advise you about the most suitable form of treatment for you. \n Endothermal ablation \n One of the first treatments offered will usually be endothermal ablation. This\u00a0involves using energy either from high-frequency radio waves (radiofrequency ablation) or lasers (endovenous laser treatment) to seal the affected veins. \n These treatments are described in more detail below. \n Radiofrequency ablation \n Radiofrequency ablation involves heating the wall of your varicose vein using radiofrequency energy. The vein is accessed through a small cut made just above or below the knee. \n A narrow tube called a catheter is guided into the vein using an ultrasound scan. A probe is inserted into the catheter that\u00a0sends out radiofrequency energy. \n This heats the vein until its walls collapse, closing it and sealing it shut. Once the vein has been sealed shut, your blood will naturally be redirected to one of your healthy veins. \n Radiofrequency ablation is carried out under  local anaesthetic  (you are awake). The procedure may cause some short-term side effects, such as pins and needles (paraesthesia). \n You may need to wear compression stockings for up to\u00a0a week after having radiofrequency ablation. \n Endovenous laser treatment \n As with radiofrequency ablation, endovenous laser treatment involves having a catheter inserted into your vein and using an ultrasound scan to guide it into the correct position. A tiny laser is passed through the catheter and positioned at the top of your varicose vein. \n The laser delivers short bursts of energy that heat up the vein and seal it closed. The laser is slowly pulled along the vein using the ultrasound scan to guide it, allowing the entire length of the vein to be closed. \n Endovenous laser treatment is carried out under local anaesthetic. After the procedure you may feel some tightness in your legs, and the affected areas may be bruised and painful. Nerve injury is also possible, but it's usually only temporary. \n Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy \n If endothermal ablation treatment is unsuitable for you, you'll usually be offered a treatment called sclerotherapy instead. \n This treatment involves injecting special foam into your veins. The foam scars the veins, which seals them closed. This type of treatment may not be suitable if you have previously had deep vein thrombosis. \n The injection is guided to the vein using an ultrasound scan. It's possible to treat more than one vein in the same session.\u00a0Both standard sclerotherapy and foam sclerotherapy are usually carried out under local anaesthetic, where a painkilling medication will be used to numb the area being treated. \n After sclerotherapy, your varicose veins should begin to fade after a few weeks as stronger veins take over the role of the damaged vein, which is no longer filled with blood. You may require treatment more than once before the vein fades, and there is a chance the vein may reappear. \n Although sclerotherapy has proven to be effective, it's not yet known how effective foam sclerotherapy is in the long term.\u00a0NICE found, on average, the treatment was effective in 84 out of 100 cases. However, in one study, the varicose veins returned in\u00a0more than\u00a0half of those treated. \n Sclerotherapy can also cause side effects, including: \n \n blood clots in other leg veins \n headaches \n lower back pain \n changes to skin colour\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, brown patches over where the treated veins were \n fainting \n temporary vision problems \n \n You should be able to walk and return to work immediately after having sclerotherapy. You will need to wear compression stockings or bandages for up to\u00a0a week.\u00a0 \n In rare cases, sclerotherapy has been known to have serious potential\u00a0complications, such as  strokes  or  transient ischaemic attacks . \n Surgery \n If endothermal ablation treatments and sclerotherapy are unsuitable for you, you'll usually be offered a surgical procedure called ligation and stripping\u00a0to remove the affected veins. \n Varicose vein surgery is usually carried out under\u00a0 general anaesthetic , which means you will be unconscious during the procedure. \n You\u00a0can usually\u00a0go home the same day, but an overnight stay in hospital\u00a0is sometimes necessary, particularly if you are having surgery on both legs. \n Ligation and stripping \n Most surgeons use a technique called ligation and stripping, which involves tying off the vein in the affected leg and then removing it. \n Two small incisions are made, approximately 5cm (2in) in diameter. The first cut is made near your groin at the top of the varicose vein. The second cut is made further down your leg, usually around your knee or ankle. The top of the vein (near your groin) is tied up and sealed. \n A thin, flexible wire is passed through the bottom of the vein\u00a0and then carefully pulled out and removed through the lower cut in your leg.\u00a0 \n The blood flow in your legs will not be affected by the surgery. This is because the veins situated deep within your legs will take over the role of the damaged veins. \n Ligation and stripping can cause pain, bruising and bleeding. More serious complications are rare, but could include nerve damage or  deep vein thrombosis , which is where a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins of the body. \n After\u00a0the procedure, you may need\u00a0up to\u00a0three weeks to recover before returning to work, although this depends on your general health and the type of work you do. You may need to wear compression stockings for up to a week after surgery. \n Transilluminated powered phlebectomy \n Transilluminated powered phlebectomy is a relatively new treatment, and there is some uncertainty about its effectiveness and safety. \n NICE does not recommend it as part of the normal treatment plan for varicose veins. However, NICE says the treatment may be offered if your doctor thinks it will help and the benefits and risks are explained. \n During transilluminated powered phlebectomy, one or two small incisions are made in your leg. Your surgeon will place a special light called an endoscopic transilluminator underneath your skin so they are able to see which veins need to be removed. The affected veins are cut before being removed through the incisions using a suction device. \n Transilluminated powered phlebectomy can either be carried out under general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic.\u00a0You may experience some bruising or bleeding afterwards.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have varicose veins and they don't cause you any discomfort, you may not need to visit your GP. Varicose veins are rarely a serious condition and they don't usually require treatment. \n However, speak to your GP if: \n \n your varicose veins are causing you pain or discomfort \n the skin over your veins is sore and irritated \n the aching in your legs is causing irritation at night and disturbing your sleep \n \n Varicose veins are diagnosed by their appearance. Your GP will examine your legs while you're standing to check for\u00a0signs of swelling.\u00a0 \n You may also be asked to describe any pain\u00a0you have and whether there are situations that make your varicose veins worse. For example, some women find\u00a0their menstrual cycle (periods) affects their varicose veins. \n Your GP will also want to know if you're at an increased risk of developing varicose veins, such as: \n \n having a family history of varicose veins \n being pregnant \n whether you have\u00a0a healthy\u00a0 body mass index (BMI)  \n having\u00a0 deep vein thrombosis  (a blood clot in one of the deep veins of the body) \n a history of leg injury\u00a0(for example,\u00a0having previously broken\u00a0a bone in your leg) \n \n Further investigation \n Your GP may refer you to\u00a0a vascular specialist (a doctor who specialises in veins) if you have any of the following: \n \n varicose veins that are causing pain, aching, discomfort, swelling, heaviness or itching (whether or not you have had varicose veins before) \n changes in the colour of the skin on your leg that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg \n skin conditions affecting your leg, such as  eczema , that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg \n varicose veins that are hard and painful that may be caused by problems with the blood flow in the leg \n a healed or unhealed\u00a0 leg ulcer  (a break in the skin that has not healed within\u00a0two weeks) below the knee \n \n In most cases, a test called a\u00a0duplex\u00a0 ultrasound scan  will be carried out.\u00a0This is a type of scan that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce a picture of the veins in your legs. \n The picture shows the blood flow and helps the vascular specialist locate any damaged valves that might be causing your varicose veins."},

The symptoms will usually clear up within a week or two. \n Treatment may need to be continued for longer if you have repeated bouts of thrush. \n Several\u00a0thrush medicines can be bought over the counter from pharmacies, while others are only available on\u00a0prescription from your GP. \n The main types are: \n \n pessaries \u2013\u00a0a special\u00a0pill that you insert into\u00a0your vagina using a special\u00a0applicator \n intravaginal creams \u2013\u00a0these are also placed into the vagina\u00a0using an applicator \n capsules \u2013 these are swallowed and may be\u00a0more convenient to use than\u00a0pessaries or intravaginal cream, but can have more troublesome side effects, such as\u00a0vomiting or an upset stomach \n \n These treatments are\u00a0all equally effective. You can usually choose\u00a0the treatment you prefer,\u00a0although\u00a0pregnant or breastfeeding women shouldn't take the\u00a0capsules. \n You can also get creams to apply to the skin surrounding the entrance of your vagina. These can help relieve itchiness and soreness, although you may find that an\u00a0ordinary\u00a0emollient (moisturiser)\u00a0works just as well. \n Read more about  treating vaginal thrush . \n What causes vaginal thrush? \n Vaginal thrush is caused by yeasts from a group of fungi called Candida. \n Many women have Candida in their vagina without it causing any problems, but thrush can develop if the natural balance of micro-organisms in the vagina\u00a0is disrupted and Candida multiplies. \n You're\u00a0more likely to get thrush\u00a0if you: \n \n are in your\u00a0twenties and thirties\u00a0\u2013 thrush is\u00a0less common in girls who haven't\u00a0started their periods\u00a0and women who have been through the  menopause  \n are pregnant \n have sex when you're not fully aroused or you're worried it may hurt \u2013 this can lead to\u00a0vaginal dryness and tightness during sex, which can trigger thrush \n take\u00a0 antibiotics  \n have poorly controlled  diabetes  \n have a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example, because of a condition such as  HIV \u00a0or a treatment such as\u00a0 chemotherapy  \n \n Vaginal thrush isn't classed as an\u00a0STI, but it can\u00a0be triggered by sex\u00a0\u2013\u00a0particularly if you have trouble relaxing and your vagina is dry\u00a0\u2013 and can occasionally be passed on to sexual partners. \n Preventing vaginal thrush \n If you get thrush frequently, you can: \n \n use water and an\u00a0emollient (moisturiser) soap substitute to clean the skin around your vagina, but\u00a0avoid cleaning this area more than once a day \n apply\u00a0a greasier\u00a0moisturiser to the skin around your vagina several times a day to protect it (but be aware that these moisturisers can weaken condoms) \n avoid potential irritants in perfumed soaps, shower gels, vaginal deodorants, wipes and douches \n avoid wearing tight-fitting underwear or tights\u00a0\u2013 some women find that special silk underwear designed for people with\u00a0eczema and thrush is helpful \n ensure your blood sugar level is kept\u00a0under control,\u00a0if you have diabetes \n \n Some women eat\u00a0probiotic yoghurt or supplements to prevent vaginal thrush, but there's little evidence to suggest this works.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Vaginal thrush is treated with medications you can buy over the counter from a pharmacy, or get on prescription from your GP. \n If you've had thrush before and think you have it again, you can normally treat it with medication bought from a local pharmacy. Otherwise, you should see your GP for advice. \n  Find your local pharmacy  \n Thrush medications \n Thrush is treated with\u00a0antifungal medicines\u00a0that are available as pessaries, intravaginal creams or capsules. \n All these medications are equally effective, but you may find that one\u00a0is more convenient to use than another. \n Pessaries and intravaginal creams \n A\u00a0pessary is a\u00a0pill that you insert into\u00a0your vagina using a special applicator. Intravaginal creams are applied inside\u00a0your vagina. \n The main types used to treat thrush are: \n \n clotrimazole \u2013\u00a0available over the counter from pharmacies \n econazole, miconazole and fenticonazole \u2013\u00a0available on prescription \n \n Over-the-counter pessaries are usually used daily for\u00a0one to\u00a0six days. Intravaginal cream is\u00a0normally used once. Possible side effects include\u00a0a mild burning sensation, slight redness or\u00a0itching. \n These\u00a0treatments\u00a0can also damage latex condoms and diaphragms, so you may want to avoid having sex, or use another form of contraception during treatment and for up to five days afterwards. \n Capsules \n If you would prefer not to use pessaries or intravaginal cream, antifungal capsules are available. \n The main types used to treat thrush are: \n \n fluconazole \u2013\u00a0available over the counter from pharmacies \n itraconazole \u2013 available on prescription \n \n Over-the-counter thrush capsules usually come as a single dose. \n Possible side\u00a0effects can include feeling sick,\u00a0an upset stomach,  diarrhoea \u00a0and  headaches . \n Skin creams \n If the skin around the entrance to your vagina is also sore or itchy, you may find it helpful to use an\u00a0antifungal skin cream in addition to one of the treatments above. \n \n Creams containing clotrimazole can be bought over the counter from pharmacies. \n They're available in packs\u00a0that also\u00a0include\u00a0antifungal pessaries, intravaginal cream or capsules. \n They're\u00a0normally applied to the skin two or three times\u00a0a day\u00a0for at least two weeks. \n Possible side effects include irritation, a stinging sensation or itching. \n \n Alternatively, you could try using\u00a0an ordinary\u00a0emollient (moisturiser) near your vagina. This can help relieve your symptoms and causes fewer side effects than antifungal cream. \n Emollients and antifungal skin cream can weaken latex condoms and diaphragms, so you may want to avoid having sex, or use another form of contraception during treatment and for up to five days afterwards. \n Sex and sexual partners \n Vaginal thrush isn't classed as a  sexually transmitted infection (STI) , so sexual partners don't need to be informed, tested or treated if they don't have any symptoms. \n However, there's a very small risk of passing the condition on during sex, so you may want to avoid having sex until it's cleared up. \n Some treatments can also weaken latex condoms and diaphragms (see above), so you may want to avoid having sex or use another form of contraception during treatment and for a few days afterwards. \n If thrush keeps coming back \n Speak to your GP if\u00a0you experience frequent bouts of thrush. \n They\u00a0might run some tests to confirm the diagnosis and check for any possible underlying cause, such as  diabetes . \n They may also give you a prescription you can use whenever the symptoms return, or suggest trying a longer course of treatment lasting up to six months. \n If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \n Visit your GP if you have thrush and you're pregnant or breastfeeding. \n Your GP will probably suggest using pessaries or an intravaginal cream.

It is a common problem and is thought to affect millions of people worldwide. \n It's not clear exactly how many people are affected, but it's estimated that between 3 and 6 million people in the UK may have some degree of urinary incontinence. \n Urinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall. \n Signs and symptoms \n The symptoms of urinary incontinence depend on the type you have. \n There are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are: \n \n stress incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure, for example when you cough or laugh \n urge incontinence \u2013 when urine leaks as you\u00a0feel a sudden,\u00a0intense urge to pass urine, or soon afterwards \n \n It is also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence. \n Read more about the  symptoms of urinary incontinence  \n What causes urinary incontinence? \n The causes of urinary incontinence depend on\u00a0the type. \n Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening or damaging of the muscles used to prevent urination,\u00a0such as the pelvic floor muscles\u00a0and the urethral sphincter. \n Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscles, which control the bladder. \n Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including: \n \n pregnancy and vaginal birth \n obesity \n a family history of incontinence \n increasing age \u2013\u00a0although incontinence is\u00a0not an inevitable part of ageing \n \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of urinary incontinence  \n Seeking medical advice \n Although you may feel embarrassed talking to someone about your symptoms, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence as this can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. \n Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a pelvic examination (in women) or rectal examination (in men). \n Your GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate. \n Read more about  diagnosing urinary incontinence  \n How urinary incontinence is treated \n Initially, your GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include: \n \n lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol \n pelvic floor exercises (exercising your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them) taught by a specialist\u00a0 \n bladder training (where you learn ways to help you can wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine) guided by a specialist \n \n You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and hand-held urinals (urine collection bottles). \n If\u00a0you are still unable to manage your symptoms, medication may be recommended.\u00a0 \n Surgery\u00a0may also be considered. The specific procedures suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have. \n Surgical treatments for stress incontinence, such as tape or sling procedures, are used to reduce pressure on the bladder, or strengthen the muscles that control urination. \n Operations to treat urge incontinence include enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles. \n Read\u00a0more about  non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence  and  surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence  \n Preventing urinary incontinence \n It is not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it developing, such as: \n \n controlling your weight \n avoiding or cutting down on alcohol \n keeping fit \u2013 in particular, ensuring that your pelvic floor muscles are strong \n \n Read more about  preventing urinary incontinence", "symptoms": "Having urinary incontinence means you pass urine unintentionally. \n When and how this happens varies depending on the type of urinary incontinence you have. \n Although you may feel embarrassed about seeking help,\u00a0it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence. \n Urinary incontinence is a common problem and seeing your GP can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. \n Common types of urinary incontinence \n Around\u00a0nine in every 10 people with\u00a0urinary incontinence have either stress incontinence or urge incontinence. \n Stress incontinence \n Stress incontinence is when you leak urine when your bladder is put under extra sudden pressure, for example when you cough. It is not related to feeling stressed. Other\u00a0activities that may cause urine to leak include:\u00a0 \n \n sneezing\u00a0 \n laughing\u00a0 \n heavy lifting\u00a0 \n exercise \n \n The amount of urine passed is usually small, but stress incontinence can\u00a0sometimes cause you to pass larger amounts, particularly if your bladder is very full. \n Urge incontinence \n Urge incontinence, or urgency incontinence, is when you feel a sudden and very intense need to pass urine and you are unable to delay going to the toilet. There is often only a few seconds between the need to urinate and the release of urine. \n Your need to pass urine may be triggered by a sudden change of position, or even by the sound of running water. You may also pass urine during sex, particularly when you reach orgasm. \n This type of incontinence often occurs as part of group of symptoms called overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), which is where the bladder muscle is more active than usual. \n As well as sometimes causing urge incontinence, OAB can also mean\u00a0you need to pass urine very frequently and you may need to get up several times during the night to urinate. \n Less common types of urinary incontinence \n Mixed incontinence \n Mixed incontinence is when you have symptoms of both stress and urge incontinence. For example, you may leak urine if you cough or sneeze, and also experience very intense urges to pass urine. \n Overflow incontinence \n Overflow incontinence, also called chronic urinary retention, occurs when the bladder cannot completely empty when you pass urine. This causes the bladder to swell above its usual size. \n If you have overflow incontinence, you may pass small trickles of urine very often. It may also feel as though your bladder is never fully empty and you cannot empty it even when you try. \n Total incontinence \n Urinary incontinence that is severe and continuous is sometimes known as total incontinence. \n Total incontinence may cause you to constantly pass large amounts of urine, even at night. Alternatively, you may pass large amounts of urine only occasionally, and leak small amounts in between.", "causes": "Urinary incontinence occurs when the normal process of storing and passing urine is disrupted. \n This can happen for a number of reasons, and certain factors\u00a0may also increase your chance of developing urinary incontinence. \n Some of the possible causes will lead to short-term urinary incontinence, while others may cause a long-term problem. If the cause can be treated, this may cure your incontinence. \n Causes of stress incontinence \n Stress incontinence\u00a0occurs when the pressure inside your bladder as it fills with urine becomes greater than the strength of your urethra to stay closed (the urethra is the tube through which urine passes out of your body).\u00a0 \n Any sudden extra pressure on your bladder, such as laughing or sneezing, can then cause urine to leak out of your urethra. \n Your urethra may not be able to stay closed if the muscles in your pelvis (pelvic floor muscles) are weak or damaged, or your urethral sphincter (the ring of muscle that keeps the urethra closed) is damaged. \n These problems may be caused by: \n \n damage during childbirth,\u00a0particularly if the child was born vaginally rather than by caesarean section \n increased pressure on your tummy, for example because you are pregnant or  obese  \n damage to the bladder or nearby area during surgery, such as the removal of the womb (hysterectomy) in women or removal of the prostate gland in men \n neurological conditions, which affect the brain and spinal cord, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis \n certain connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome \n certain medications (see below) \n \n Causes of urge incontinence \n The urgent and frequent need to pass urine can be caused by a problem with the detrusor muscles in the walls of the bladder. The detrusor muscles relax to allow the bladder to fill with urine, then contract when you go to the toilet to let the urine out. \n Sometimes the detrusor muscles contract too often, creating an urgent need to go to the toilet. This is\u00a0known as\u00a0having an 'overactive bladder'.\u00a0The reason your\u00a0detrusor muscles contract too often may not be clear, but possible causes include: \u00a0 \n \n drinking too much alcohol or caffeine \n poor fluid intake \u2013 this can cause strong, concentrated urine to collect in your bladder, which can irritate your bladder and cause symptoms of overactivity \n  constipation  \n conditions affecting the lower urinary tract (urethra and bladder), such as  urinary tract infections (UTIs)  or tumours in the bladder \n neurological conditions \n certain medications (see below) \n \n Causes of overflow incontinence \n Overflow incontinence, also called chronic urinary retention, is often caused by a blockage or obstruction to your bladder. Your bladder may fill up as usual, but as it is obstructed you will not be able to empty it completely, even when you try. \n At the same time, pressure from the urine that is still in your bladder builds up behind the obstruction, causing frequent leaks. \n Your bladder can become obstructed as a result of: \n \n an\u00a0 enlarged prostate gland  (in men) \n bladder stones \n  constipation  \n \n Overflow incontinence may also be caused by your detrusor muscles not fully contracting, which means that your bladder does not completely empty when you go to the toilet. As a result, the bladder becomes stretched. Your detrusor muscles may not fully contract if: \n \n there is damage to your nerves, for example as a result of surgery to part of your bowel or a spinal cord injury\u00a0 \n you are taking certain medications (see below) \n \n Causes of total incontinence \n Total incontinence occurs when your bladder cannot store any urine at all. It can result in you either passing large amounts of urine constantly, or passing urine occasionally with frequent leaking. \n Total incontinence can be caused by: \n \n a problem with your bladder\u00a0from birth\u00a0 \n injury to your spinal cord, which can disrupt the nerve signals between your brain and your bladder\u00a0 \n a bladder fistula, which is\u00a0a small tunnel-like hole that can form between\u00a0the bladder and a nearby area, such as the vagina, in women \n \n Medications that may cause incontinence \n Some medicines can disrupt the normal process of storing and passing urine, or increase the amount of urine you produce. These include: \n \n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n diuretics \n some  antidepressants  \n hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \n sedatives \n \n Stopping these medications, if advised to do so by a doctor, may help resolve your incontinence. \n Who is most at risk? \n In addition to the causes mentioned above, there are some things that can increase your risk of developing urinary incontinence without directly being the cause of the problem. These are known as risk factors. \n Some of the main risk factors for urinary incontinence include: \n \n family history \u2013 there may be a genetic link to urinary incontinence, so you may be more at risk if other people in your family have experienced the problem \n increasing age \u2013 urinary incontinence becomes more common as you reach middle age and is\u00a0particularly common in\u00a0people over 80 \n having lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) \u2013 a range of\u00a0symptoms that affect the bladder and urethra (read about the\u00a0 symptoms of urinary incontinence \u00a0for more information)", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you experience urinary incontinence, see your GP so they can determine the type of condition you have. \n Try not to be\u00a0embarrassed to speak to your GP about your incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a common problem and it's likely your GP has seen many people with the condition. \n Your GP will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history, including: \n \n whether the urinary incontinence occurs when you cough or laugh \n whether you need the toilet frequently during the day or night \n whether you have any difficulty passing urine when you go to the toilet\u00a0 \n whether you are currently taking any medications \n how much fluid, alcohol or caffeine you drink\u00a0 \n \n Bladder diary \n Your GP may suggest that you keep a diary of your bladder habits for at least three days, so you can give them as much information as possible about your condition. This should include details such as: \n \n how much fluid you drink \n the types of fluid you drink \n how often you need to pass urine \n the amount of urine you pass \n how many episodes of incontinence you experience\u00a0 \n how many times you experience an urgent need to go to the toilet \n \n Tests and examinations\u00a0 \n You may also need to have some tests and examinations so that your GP can confirm or rule out things that may be causing your incontinence. Some of these are explained below. \n Physical examination \n Your GP may examine you to assess the health of your urinary system. \n If you are female, your GP will carry out a pelvic examination, which usually involves undressing from the waist down.\u00a0You may be asked\u00a0to cough to see if any urine leaks out. \n Your GP may also examine your vagina. In over half of women with stress incontinence, part of the bladder may bulge into the vagina. \n Your GP may place their finger inside your vagina and ask you to squeeze it with your pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles that surround your bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes out of the body). Damage to your pelvic floor muscles can lead to urinary incontinence. \n If you are male, your GP may check whether your prostate gland is enlarged. The prostate gland is located between the penis and bladder, and surrounds the urethra. If it is enlarged, it can cause symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as a frequent need to urinate. \n You may also need\u00a0a\u00a0digital rectal examination\u00a0to check the health of your prostate gland. This will involve your GP inserting their finger into your bottom.\u00a0 \n Dipstick test \n If your GP thinks your symptoms may be caused by a\u00a0 urinary tract\u00a0infection (UTI) , a sample of your urine may be tested for bacteria. A small, chemically treated stick\u00a0is dipped into your urine sample.\u00a0It will change colour if\u00a0bacteria are\u00a0present. The dipstick test can also check the blood and protein levels in your urine. \n Residual urine test \n If your GP thinks you may have overflow incontinence, they may suggest a test called residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you go for a wee. \n This is usually done by carrying out an  ultrasound scan  of your bladder, although occasionally the amount of urine in your bladder may be measured after it has been drained using a catheter. This is a thin, flexible tube that is inserted into\u00a0your urethra and\u00a0passed through to your bladder. \n Further tests \n Some further tests may be necessary if the cause of your urinary incontinence is not clear. Your GP will usually start treating you first and may suggest these tests if treatment is not effective.\u00a0 \n Cystoscopy \n A cystoscopy involves using a flexible viewing tube, known as an endoscope, to look inside your bladder and urinary system. This test can identify abnormalities that may be causing incontinence. \n Urodynamic tests \n These\u00a0are a group of tests used to check the function of your bladder and urethra. This may include keeping a bladder diary for a few days (see above) and then attending an appointment at a hospital or clinic for tests such as: \n \n measuring the pressure in your bladder by inserting a catheter\u00a0into your urethra \n measuring the pressure in your abdomen (tummy) by inserting a catheter into your bottom \n asking you to urinate into a special machine that measures the amount and flow of urine"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Urinary tract infection (UTI)", "introduction": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections that can affect the bladder, the kidneys and the tubes connected to them. \n Anyone can get them, but they're particularly common in women. Some women experience them regularly (called recurrent UTIs). \n UTIs can be painful and uncomfortable, but usually pass within a few days\u00a0and can be easily treated with  antibiotics . \n This page\u00a0is about\u00a0UTIs in adults. There is a separate article about  UTIs in children . \n This page covers: \n  Symptoms  \n  When to get medical advice  \n  Treatment  \n  Causes  \n  Prevention  \n Symptoms of UTIs \n Infections of the\u00a0bladder\u00a0(cystitis) or urethra (tube that carries urine out of the body)\u00a0are\u00a0known as lower UTIs. These can cause: \n \n a need to pee more often than usual \n pain or discomfort when peeing \n sudden urges to pee \n feeling as though you're unable to empty your bladder fully \n pain low down in your tummy \n urine that's cloudy, foul-smelling or contains blood \n feeling generally unwell, achy and tired \n \n  Infections of the kidneys  or ureters (tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder)\u00a0are\u00a0known as\u00a0upper UTIs. These\u00a0can cause\u00a0the above symptoms and also: \n \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4\u00baF) or above \n pain in your sides or back \n shivering and chills \n feeling and being sick \n confusion \n agitation or restlessness \n \n Lower UTIs are common and aren't usually a cause for major concern. Upper UTIs can be serious if left untreated, as they could damage the kidneys or\u00a0spread to the\u00a0bloodstream. \n When to get medical advice \n It's a good idea to see your GP if you think you might have a UTI, particularly if: \n \n you have symptoms of an upper UTI (see above) \n the\u00a0symptoms are severe or getting worse \n the symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days \n you get UTIs frequently \n \n Your GP can rule out other possible causes of your symptoms by testing a sample of your urine and\u00a0can prescribe antibiotics if you do have an infection. \n Antibiotics are usually\u00a0recommended because untreated UTIs can potentially cause serious problems if they're allowed to\u00a0spread. \n Treatment for UTIs \n UTIs are\u00a0normally\u00a0treated with a short course of antibiotics. \n Most women are given a three-day course of antibiotic capsules or tablets. Men, pregnant women and people with more serious symptoms may need a slightly longer course. \n Your symptoms will normally pass within\u00a0three to five days of starting treatment. But make sure you complete the whole course of antibiotics that you've been prescribed,\u00a0even if you're feeling better. \n Over-the-counter painkillers such as  paracetamol \u00a0can help with any pain. Drinking plenty of fluids\u00a0may also help you feel better. \n Return to your GP if your symptoms don't improve, get worse or come back after treatment. \n Causes of UTIs \n UTIs occur when\u00a0the urinary tract becomes infected, usually by bacteria. In most cases, bacteria from the gut\u00a0enter the urinary tract through the urethra. \n This may\u00a0occur\u00a0when wiping your bottom or having sex, for example, but\u00a0often it's not\u00a0clear why it happens. \n The following\u00a0may increase your risk of getting a UTI: \n \n conditions that obstruct your urinary tract, such as\u00a0 kidney stones  \n difficulty emptying your bladder fully \n using\u00a0a\u00a0 contraceptive diaphragm  or\u00a0 condoms  coated in spermicide \n  diabetes  \n a weak immune system\u00a0\u2013 from\u00a0 chemotherapy  or  HIV ,\u00a0for example\u00a0 \n a\u00a0urinary catheter\u00a0(a tube\u00a0in your bladder used to drain urine) \n an  enlarged prostate gland  in men \n \n Women may be more likely to get UTIs because\u00a0their urethra is shorter than a man's and is closer to their anus (back passage). \n Preventing UTIs \n If you get\u00a0UTIs frequently, there are some things you can try that may stop it coming back. However, it's not clear how effective most of these measures are. \n These measures include: \n \n avoiding perfumed bubble bath, soap or talcum powder around your genitals \u2013 use plain, unperfumed varieties, and have a shower rather than a bath \n going to the toilet as soon as you need to pee and always emptying your bladder fully \n staying well hydrated\u00a0 \n wiping your bottom from front to back when you go to the toilet \n emptying your bladder as soon as possible after having sex \n not using a contraceptive\u00a0diaphragm or condoms\u00a0with spermicidal lubricant\u00a0on them\u00a0\u2013 you may wish to use another method of contraception instead \n wearing underwear made from cotton, rather than synthetic material such as nylon, and avoiding tight jeans and trousers \n \n Speak to your GP if these measures don't work. They may suggest taking a long-term course of antibiotics or they may give you a prescription for antibiotics you can use as soon as you experience symptoms of a UTI. \n There's currently little evidence to suggest that drinking cranberry juice or using probiotics significantly reduces your chances of getting UTIs.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Urticaria (hives)", "introduction": "Urticaria\u00a0\u2013\u00a0also known as hives, weals, welts or nettle rash\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is a raised, itchy rash that appears on the skin.\u00a0It may appear on one part of the body or be spread across large areas.\u00a0 \n The rash is\u00a0usually very itchy and ranges in size from a few millimetres to the size of a hand. \n Although the affected area may change in\u00a0appearance within 24 hours, the rash usually settles within a few days. \n Doctors may refer to urticaria as either: \n \n  acute urticaria \u2013 if the rash clears completely within 6\u00a0weeks \n  chronic urticaria\u00a0 \u2013in rarer cases, where the rash persists or comes and goes for more than 6\u00a0weeks, often over many years \n \n A much rarer type of urticaria, known as urticaria vasculitis, can cause blood vessels inside the skin to become inflamed.\u00a0In these cases, the weals last longer than 24 hours, are more painful, and can leave a bruise. \n When to seek medical advice \n Visit your GP if your symptoms don't go away within 48 hours. \n You should also contact your GP if your symptoms are: \n \n severe \n causing distress \n disrupting daily activities \n occurring alongside other symptoms \n \n Who's affected by urticaria? \n Acute urticaria (also known as short-term urticaria) is a common condition, estimated to affect around 1in 5\u00a0people\u00a0at some point in their lives. \n Children are often\u00a0affected by the condition, as well as women aged 30 to 60, and people with a history of  allergies . \n What causes urticaria? \n Urticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin.These substances cause the blood vessels in the affected area of skin to open up (often resulting in\u00a0redness or pinkness) and become leaky. This extra fluid in the tissues causes swelling and itchiness. \n Histamine is released for many reasons, including: \n \n an\u00a0allergic reaction \u2013 such as a  food allergy \u00a0or a reaction to an\u00a0 insect bite or sting  \n cold or heat\u00a0exposure\u00a0 \n infection \u2013 such as a\u00a0 cold  \n certain medications \u2013 such as  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  or  antibiotics  \n \n However, in many cases of urticaria, no obvious cause can be found. \n Some cases of long-term urticaria may be\u00a0caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. However, this is difficult to diagnose and the treatment options are the same. \n Certain triggers may also make the symptoms worse. These include: \n \n drinking\u00a0 alcohol  or caffeine \n emotional\u00a0stress \n warm temperature \n \n Read more about the  causes of urticaria . \n Diagnosing urticaria \n Your GP will usually be able to diagnose urticaria by examining the rash. They may also ask you questions to find out what triggered your symptoms. \n If your GP thinks that it's caused by an allergic reaction, you may be referred to an allergy clinic for\u00a0an  allergy test . However, if you've had urticaria most days for more than 6\u00a0weeks, it's unlikely to be the result of\u00a0an allergy. \n You may also be referred for a number of tests, including a\u00a0 full blood count (FBC) ,\u00a0to find out whether\u00a0there's an underlying cause of your symptoms. \n Read more about  diagnosing urticaria . \n Treating urticaria \n In many cases, treatment isn't needed for urticaria, because the rash often gets better within a few days. \n If the itchiness is causing you discomfort, antihistamines can help. Antihistamines are available over the counter at pharmacies \u2013 speak to your pharmacist for advice. \n A short course of steroid tablets (oral  corticosteroids ) may occasionally be needed for more severe cases of urticaria. \n If you have persistent urticaria, you\u00a0may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). Treatment usually involves medication to relieve the symptoms, while identifying and avoiding potential triggers. \n Read about  treating urticaria . \n Complications of urticaria \n Around a quarter of people with acute urticaria and half of people with chronic urticaria also develop angioedema, which is a deeper swelling of tissues. \n Chronic urticaria can also be upsetting and negatively impact a person's mood and quality of life. \n Angioedema \n  Angioedema  is swelling in the deeper layers of a person's skin. It's often severe and is caused by a build-up of fluid.\u00a0The\u00a0 symptoms of angioedema  can affect any part of the body, but usually affect the: \n \n eyes \n lips \n genitals \n hands \n feet \n \n Medication such as antihistamines and short courses of oral corticosteroids (tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling. \n Read more about  treating angioedema . \n Emotional impact \n Living with any long-term condition can be difficult. Chronic urticaria can have a considerable negative impact on a person's mood and quality of\u00a0life. Living with itchy skin can be particularly upsetting. \n One study found that chronic urticaria can have the same negative impact as  heart disease . It also found that 1\u00a0in 7\u00a0people with chronic urticaria had some sort of psychological or emotional problem, such as:\u00a0 \n \n stress \n anxiety \n  depression  \n \n See your GP if your urticaria is getting you down. Effective treatments are available to improve your symptoms. \n Talking to friends and family can also improve feelings of isolation and help you cope better with your condition. \n Anaphylaxis \n Urticaria can be one of the first symptoms of a severe allergic reaction known as  anaphylaxis . \n Other symptoms of anaphylaxis include: \n \n swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet \n feeling lightheaded or faint \n narrowing of the airways, which can cause wheezing and breathing difficulties \n abdominal pain,\u00a0nausea and vomiting\u00a0 \n collapsing and becoming unconsciousness \n \n Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. \n  Call 999 immediately\u00a0and ask for an ambulance if you or someone else is experiencing anaphylaxis. Tell the operator about your (or their) symptoms.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Urticaria occurs when histamine and other chemicals are released from under the skin's surface, causing the tissues to swell. \n Short-term (acute) urticaria\u00a0 \n The triggers of acute urticaria are unknown in around half of all cases. \n Recognised triggers include: \n \n a  food\u00a0allergy \u2013 to foods such as peanuts, shellfish, eggs and cheese \n an\u00a0 allergic reaction  \u2013 to environmental factors such as pollen, dust mites or chemicals \n an allergic reaction to latex \u2013 which can be a common problem in healthcare workers \n infections\u2013 which can range from relatively trivial, such as a\u00a0 cold , to very serious, such as  HIV  \n  insect\u00a0bites and stings  \n emotional stress \n certain medications that can cause urticaria as a side effect \u2013 including\u00a0 antibiotics ,\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and  aspirin  \n physical triggers \u2013such as pressure to the skin, changes in temperature, sunlight, exercise or water \n \n Long-term (chronic) urticaria \n Chronic urticaria may occur when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. This is known as an autoimmune reaction. \n About a third to half of all chronic cases of urticaria are thought to be autoimmune related. \n It's not known why autoimmune urticaria develops, although it can sometimes occur\u00a0in combination with other autoimmune conditions, such as: \n \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \u2013 when the immune system attacks the joints \n  lupus  \u2013when\u00a0the immune system attacks the joints and skin, and people usually feel tired all the time \n \n Chronic urticaria can also be linked to other chronic illnesses and infections, such as: \n \n viral\u00a0hepatitis (liver infection) \n intestinal parasites \n an  underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)  \n an\u00a0 overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)  \n \n Chronic urticaria tends to come and go. Many people find that certain things make it reappear or make existing symptoms worse. Triggers sometimes include: \n \n stress \n  alcohol  \n caffeine \n warm temperatures \n prolonged pressure on the skin \u2013 this can happen by wearing tight clothing \n medications \u2013such as NSAIDs, and the painkiller codeine \n certain food additives \u2013such as salicylates, which are found in tomatoes, orange juice and tea \n insect bites and stings \n exposure to heat, cold, pressure or water \n \n ACE inhibitors that are often used to treat  high blood pressure (hypertension)  can be linked to deeper swellings of  angioedema .", "treatment": "Most cases of urticaria don't need treatment, because the symptoms are usually mild and often get better within a few days. \n Short-term (acute) urticaria \n If your symptoms are troublesome or persistent,\u00a0antihistamines are available over the counter from pharmacies. \n See your GP or speak to your pharmacist if your symptoms get worse. If your symptoms are very severe, your GP may prescribe other medications,\u00a0such as a short course of  corticosteroid tablets . \n Go back to your GP if your\u00a0symptoms get worse or if the treatment hasn't worked after 2\u00a0weeks. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines\u00a0block the effects of histamine, helping to stop the itchiness and reduce the rash. Examples of antihistamines include: \n \n cetirizine\u00a0 \n fexofenadine\u00a0 \n loratadine\u00a0 \n \n For most people, modern antihistamines don't cause drowsiness, although there are some exceptions. See how you react to the antihistamine before driving or operating heavy machinery. Antihistamines may also cause drowsiness if taken with alcohol. Always read the information leaflet that comes with the medication. \n Antihistamines aren't usually prescribed to pregnant women, as it's not known whether they're entirely safe. However, chlorphenamine may be recommended if it's believed that the benefits outweigh the risks. There's no evidence that\u00a0chlorphenamine harms unborn babies. \n Corticosteroid tablets \n You may be prescribed a short course of high-dose corticosteroid tablets, such as prednisolone, if your symptoms are severe. \n Corticosteroids suppress your immune system, which lessens the symptoms of urticaria. A course of prednisolone lasting between 3\u00a0and 5\u00a0days is usually recommended. \n Taking steroid tablets on a long-term basis isn't usually recommended, because it can lead to a wide range of side effects and complications, such as:\u00a0 \n \n  high blood pressure (hypertension)  \n glaucoma \n cataracts \n  diabetes  (or it can make existing diabetes worse) \n \n Long-term (chronic) urticaria \n Treatment for chronic urticaria involves trying to control your symptoms and avoiding any triggers that make them worse. \n If you have chronic urticaria and  angioedema , you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist). This is because angioedema is potentially more serious and can cause breathing difficulties. \n You should also be referred to a\u00a0dermatologist if you just have chronic urticaria and the symptoms continue, despite treatment. \n Antihistamines \n Chronic urticaria is treated with antihistamines. You may have to take them regularly for as long as your symptoms last. \n An\u00a0increased dose may be recommended if your symptoms don't respond to treatment. Increasing the dose can often help to control symptoms that previously didn't respond to treatment. However, this should only be carried\u00a0out under the\u00a0instruction of\u00a0the doctor in charge of your care. \n Menthol cream \n Menthol cream can be used as an alternative or in addition to antihistamines because it helps to relieve itchiness. Your GP can prescribe this. \n Corticosteroid tablets \n Occasionally, more serious episodes of urticaria can be treated with short doses of corticosteroid tablets, such as prednisolone. Possible side effects of corticosteroid tablets include: \n \n increased appetite and weight gain \n mood change \n  difficulty sleeping (insomnia)  \n \n Long-term use of corticosteroids for chronic urticaria isn't recommended for the reasons mentioned above. \n H2 antihistamines \n The type of antihistamines you can get from the pharmacist are known as H1 antihistamines. However, there are several other types of antihistamines, including H2 antihistamines. \n H2 antihistamines can sometimes be useful for treating chronic urticaria, because they narrow blood vessels, which can reduce the skin's redness. \n H2 antihistamines can be used\u00a0as an alternative to\u00a0H1 antihistamines or in combination with them. Side effects of H2 antihistamines are uncommon, but include: \n \n  headache  \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n dizziness\u00a0 \n \n Don't drive or use tools or machinery if you feel dizzy after taking a H2 antihistamine. \n Leukotriene receptor antagonists \n Leukotriene receptor antagonists are a type of medication that can help to reduce redness and swelling of the skin. \n They can be a useful long-term alternative to using corticosteroid tablets, because they don't carry the same risk of causing wide-ranging side effects. \n The side effects of leukotriene receptor antagonists are rare\u00a0and relatively minor. They include\u00a0headaches and nausea (feeling sick). \n Ciclosporin \n In around two-thirds of cases, a powerful medication called ciclosporin has proved effective in treating urticaria. \n Ciclosporin works in a similar way to\u00a0corticosteroids. It suppresses the harmful effects of the immune system and is available in capsule form or as a liquid. \n Side effects of ciclosporin include: \n \n  high blood pressure (hypertension)  \n kidney problems\u00a0 \n increased levels of\u00a0 blood cholesterol \u00a0 \n headaches \n involuntary shaking (tremors) \n increased vulnerability to infection, particularly  chest infections ,\u00a0 urinary tract infections (UTIs)  and a type of viral infection known as\u00a0cytomegalovirus \n \n There are also a number of other side effects that can occur when taking ciclosporin, and you should discuss these thoroughly with your doctor before starting.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Side effects, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, are a particular cause for concern, because they can increase your risk of\u00a0 heart disease  and  stroke . \n Even if you still respond to treatment, it may be recommended that the medication is withdrawn after a few months. \n Omaluzimab \n For urticaria that hasn't responded to antihistamines, there are newer medications becoming available, such as omalizumab.\u00a0Omalizumab is given by\u00a0injection and\u00a0is thought to reduce a type of antibody that can play a part in urticaria. \n Diet \n There's some\u00a0uncertainty over the role of diet in people with\u00a0long-term\u00a0urticaria. There are 2\u00a0groups of chemicals in foods that may trigger urticaria in some people \u2013vasoactive amines and salicylates. \n The\u00a0 Allergy UK  website has more information on: \n \n  vasoactive amines  \n  salicylates  \n \n Avoiding or cutting down on foods that contain these chemicals may improve your symptoms. You could also keep a food diary to see whether avoiding certain foods helps you. \n However, you should talk to a dietitian before restricting your diet. They can make sure you're not avoiding foods unnecessarily and that your diet is healthy. \n Avoiding triggers \n If you know what triggers your urticaria or makes it worse, avoiding the trigger may keep your symptoms\u00a0under control. \n Triggers such as\u00a0 alcohol  and caffeine can be easily avoided. If you think that a certain\u00a0medication may be triggering your symptoms, contact the doctor who prescribed it, because alternatives may be available. \n Avoiding\u00a0stress can be more difficult, particularly if your symptoms negatively affect your quality of life. \n If you have severe urticaria or urticaria that keeps coming back, you may find that relaxation techniques, such as meditation or hypnosis, reduce your stress levels and the severity of your symptoms.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Urticaria can usually be diagnosed by examining the distinctive red rash. \n If you have\u00a0long-term (chronic) urticaria, a number of tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause. \n Short-term (acute) urticaria \n Your GP can usually diagnose acute urticaria by examining the rash. \n They'll also ask you some questions to find out what triggered your symptoms, including: \n \n when and where the rash\u00a0began \n what you had to eat just before it began and details of your usual diet \n if you started taking any new medication just before your symptoms began \n if you live or work in an environment where you come into contact with possible triggers \u2013 such as pets, chemicals or latex gloves \n if you were stung or bitten by an insect just before your symptoms started \n your current state of health and if you've had any recent infections \n if you've recently travelled to a foreign country and if so, where \n if there's a history of urticaria in your family \n \n In around half of all cases of acute urticaria,\u00a0a cause can't be identified. \n If your GP thinks your symptoms are caused by an  allergic reaction , you may have to go to an allergy clinic. \n  Allergy testing \u00a0may be needed to find out if you're allergic to suspected triggers for urticaria. \n Long-term\u00a0(chronic) urticaria \n If your urticaria lasts for more than 6\u00a0weeks, it's very unlikely\u00a0to be caused by an allergy, so allergy tests aren't usually recommended. \n However, your GP should ask about anything that makes your urticaria worse, such as: \n \n any medicines you're taking \n your\u00a0 alcohol  and caffeine consumption \n your stress levels \n \n You may also be referred for a number of tests to find out if there's an underlying cause of your chronic urticaria. These tests may include: \n \n a full blood count test (FBC) \u2013 which can identify  anaemia  \n tests to determine the levels of antibodies in your blood \n a stool sample \u2013 which can identify intestinal parasites \n an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test \u2013 which can help to identify problems with your immune system \n thyroid function tests \u2013 which can be used to check for\u00a0an\u00a0 underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)  or\u00a0an\u00a0 overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)  \n liver function tests \u2013 which can be used to check if you have any problems with your liver"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Venous leg ulcer", "introduction": "A leg ulcer is a long-lasting (chronic) sore that takes more than 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks to heal. They usually develop on the inside of the leg, just above the ankle. \n The\u00a0 symptoms of a venous leg ulcer  include pain, itching and swelling in the affected leg. There may also be discoloured or hardened skin around the ulcer, and the sore may produce a foul-smelling discharge. \n See your GP if you think you have a leg ulcer, as it will need specialist treatment to help it heal. \n Your GP will examine your leg and may carry out additional tests to rule out other conditions. \n Read more about  how a venous leg ulcer is diagnosed . \n What causes venous leg ulcers? \n A venous leg ulcer is the most common type of leg ulcer, accounting for over 90% of all cases. \n Venous leg ulcers can develop after a minor injury, where persistently high pressure in the veins of the legs has damaged the skin. \n Read more about the  causes of venous leg ulcers . \n Who's affected? \n Venous leg ulcers are estimated to affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK, although they become much more common with age. It's estimated that around 1 in 50 people over the age of 80 has one. \n You're more at risk of developing one if you've previously had\u00a0 deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  or\u00a0find it difficult to\u00a0walk because of a problem such as: \n \n  osteoarthritis  \n a leg injury \n  obesity  \n paralysis \n \n You're also more at risk if\u00a0you've recently had an operation on your leg, such as a  hip replacement \u00a0or  knee replacement . \n People with\u00a0 varicose veins  (swollen and enlarged veins) also have a higher risk of developing venous leg ulcers. \n How venous leg ulcers are treated \n Most venous leg ulcers heal within 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0months if they're treated by a healthcare professional trained in compression therapy for leg ulcers. However, some ulcers may take longer to heal, and a very small number never heal. \n Treatment usually involves: \n \n cleaning and dressing the wound \n using compression, such as bandages or stockings, to improve the flow of blood in the legs \n \n  Antibiotics \u00a0may also be used if the ulcer becomes infected, but they don't help ulcers to heal. \n However, unless the underlying cause of the ulcer is addressed, there's a high risk of a venous leg ulcer recurring after treatment. Underlying causes could include immobility, obesity, previous DVT, or varicose veins. \n Read more about  treating venous leg ulcers . \n Can venous leg ulcers be prevented? \n There are several ways to help prevent a venous leg ulcer in people at risk, such as:\u00a0 \n \n wearing compression stockings \n losing weight if you're overweight \n exercising regularly \n elevating your leg when possible \n \n This is particularly important if you've previously had a leg ulcer \u2013 once a leg has suffered a venous ulcer, you're at risk of further ulcers developing within months or years. \n Read more about  preventing venous leg ulcers .", "symptoms": "Venous leg ulcers are open, often painful, sores in the skin that take more than a month to heal.

Usually, this will be a practice or district nurse. \n Cleaning and dressing the ulcer \n The first step is to remove any debris or dead tissue from the ulcer and apply an appropriate dressing. This provides the best conditions for the ulcer to heal. \n A simple, non-sticky dressing will be used to dress your ulcer. This usually needs to be changed once a week. Many people find they can manage cleaning and dressing their own ulcer under the supervision of a nurse. \n Compression \n To improve vein circulation in your legs and treat swelling, your nurse will apply a firm compression bandage over the affected leg. These bandages are designed to squeeze your legs and encourage blood to flow upwards, towards your heart. \n There are many different types of bandage\u00a0or elastic stockings used to treat venous leg ulcers, which\u00a0may be made\u00a0in 2, 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0different layers. The application of a compression bandage is a skilled procedure and they should only be applied by trained healthcare staff. \n The bandage is changed once a week, when the dressing is changed. \n When compression bandages are first applied to an unhealthy ulcer, it's usually painful.\u00a0Ideally, you should have\u00a0 paracetamol  or an alternative painkiller prescribed by your GP.\u00a0The pain will lessen once the ulcer starts to heal, but this can take up to 10-12 days. \n It's important to wear your compression bandage exactly as instructed. If you have any problems, it's usually best to contact your nurse, instead of trying to remove it yourself. If the compression bandage feels a little too tight and is uncomfortable in bed at night, getting up for a short walk will usually help. \n However,\u00a0you'll need to cut the bandage off if: \n \n you get severe pain at the front of your ankle \n you get severe pain on the top of your foot \n your toes become blue and swollen \n \n Once you remove the bandage,\u00a0make sure you keep your leg highly elevated and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. \n In some clinics, specialist teams are using new alternatives to compression bandages, such as special stockings or other compressive devices. These may not be available in every clinic but\u00a0could change the way ulcers are treated in future. Your specialist will be able to advise you whether a different approach may help you. \n Treating associated symptoms \n Swelling in the legs and ankles \n Venous leg ulcers are often accompanied by swelling of your feet and ankles (oedema), which is caused by fluid. This can be controlled by compression bandages. \n Keeping your leg elevated whenever possible, ideally with your toes at the same level as your eyes, will also help ease swelling. You should put a suitcase, sofa cushion or foam wedge under the bottom of your mattress, to help keep your legs raised while you sleep. \n You should also keep as active as possible and aim to continue with your normal activities. Regular exercise, such as a daily walk, will help reduce leg swelling. However, you should avoid standing or sitting still with your feet down. You should elevate your feet at least every hour. \n Itchy skin \n Some people with venous leg ulcers develop rashes with scaly and itchy skin. \n This is\u00a0often due to\u00a0 varicose eczema , which can be treated with a moisturiser (emollient) and occasionally a mild  corticosteroid  cream or ointment. In\u00a0rare cases,\u00a0you may need to be referred to a dermatologist (skin specialist) for treatment. \n Itchy skin can also sometimes be caused by an allergic reaction to the dressings or creams applied by your nurse. If this happens, you may need to be tested for allergies. \n It's important to avoid scratching your legs if they feel itchy, because this damages the skin and may lead to further ulcers. \n Looking after yourself during\u00a0treatment \n To help your ulcer heal more quickly, follow the advice below: \n \n Try to keep active by walking regularly. Sitting and standing still without elevating your legs can make venous leg ulcers and swelling worse \n Whenever you're sitting or lying down, keep your affected leg elevated \u2013 with\u00a0your\u00a0toes level with your eyes \n Regularly exercise your legs by moving your feet up and down, and rotating them at the ankles. This can help encourage better circulation \n If you're overweight, try to reduce your weight with\u00a0a  healthy diet  and regular exercise \n  Stop smoking \u00a0and  moderate your alcohol consumption . This can help the ulcer heal faster. \n Be careful not to injure your affected leg, and wear comfortable, well-fitting footwear. \n \n You may also find it helpful to attend a local healthy leg club, such as those provided by the\u00a0 Lindsay Leg Club Foundation , for support and advice. \n Treating an infected ulcer \n An ulcer sometimes produces a large amount of discharge and becomes more painful. There may also be redness around the ulcer. These symptoms\u00a0and feeling unwell are signs of infection. \n If your ulcer becomes infected, it should be cleaned and dressed as usual. \n You should also elevate your leg most of the time and you'll be prescribed a 7-day course of\u00a0 antibiotics . \n The aim of antibiotic treatment is to\u00a0clear the infection. However, antibiotics don't heal ulcers and should only be used in short courses to treat\u00a0infected ulcers. \n Follow-up \n You should visit your nurse once a week to have your dressings and compression bandages changed. They'll also monitor the ulcer to see how well it's healing. Once your ulcer is healing well, your nurse will see you less often. \n After the ulcer has healed \n Once you've had a venous leg ulcer, another ulcer could develop within months or years. \n The most effective method of preventing this is to wear compression stockings at all times when you're out of bed. Your nurse will help you find a stocking that fits correctly and that you can manage yourself. \n Various accessories are available to help you put them on and take them off. \n Read more about  preventing venous leg ulcers .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you think you have a venous leg ulcer. The ulcer is unlikely to heal without specialist treatment. \n Diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and examination of your affected leg, although additional tests may be required. \n Medical history and examination \n Your GP or practice nurse will ask whether you have any other symptoms associated with venous leg ulcers, such as: \n \n swelling in your ankles \n discoloured or hard skin \n \n They'll try to determine the cause of the ulcer by asking about underlying conditions or previous injuries, such as: \n \n  diabetes  \n  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  \n injury or surgery in the affected leg \n a previous leg ulcer \n \n They'll also examine your leg, both when you're standing up and lying down.\u00a0 Varicose veins  will be more obvious when you're standing up, and it will be easier to look at the ulcer when you're lying down. \n They'll also feel your pulse at your ankles to make sure the arteries in your leg are working properly. \n Doppler study \n To rule out\u00a0peripheral arterial disease\u00a0(a\u00a0condition affecting the arteries) as a\u00a0possible cause of your symptoms, your GP or nurse will carry out a test known as a Doppler study. \n This involves measuring the blood pressure in the arteries at your ankles and comparing it\u00a0to the pressure in your arms.\u00a0If you have peripheral arterial disease, the blood pressure in your ankles will be lower than your arms. \n It's important to carry out this check as the main treatment for venous ulcers is compression bandages or stockings to improve the\u00a0vein circulation in your legs. It's not safe to apply compression if the ankle artery pressures are low. \n Read more about  how venous leg ulcers are treated . \n Referral to a specialist \n In some cases, your GP or nurse may decide to refer you to\u00a0a specialist in conditions affecting the blood vessels (vascular specialist). \n For example, you may be referred to a vascular specialist if your GP or nurse is unsure about your diagnosis, or if they suspect your ulcer may be caused by artery diseases, diabetes\u00a0or  rheumatoid arthritis . \n After taking your medical history and examining you, the vascular specialist may need to arrange further investigations to plan your treatment."},

If your child's had a UTI before, it's important that both of you watch\u00a0for the return of any associated symptoms. \n Tell your GP about any symptoms\u00a0as soon as possible so a diagnosis can be confirmed and treatment can begin. \n If\u00a0your child\u00a0has a problem that increases their risk of UTIs, such as faulty valves that allow urine to flow the wrong way,\u00a0they may be prescribed low-dose\u00a0antibiotics as a long-term measure to prevent further infections.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Most urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children can be effectively treated with antibiotic medication. \n This medication can often be given at home, although there are some situations where it may be necessary for your child to stay in hospital for a few days. \n Treatment at home \n If your child is\u00a0over three months old and not thought to be at risk of serious illness, they can usually be treated at home with\u00a0 antibiotics . \n The recommended length of treatment depends on whether your child has: \n \n a lower UTI\u00a0\u2013 usually a 3-day course \n an upper UTI\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually a 7- to 10-day course \n \n Your child may experience some side effects while taking antibiotics, but these are usually mild and should pass\u00a0once they stop taking the medication. \n Common side effects of antibiotics include: \n \n feeling sick \n vomiting \n an upset stomach \n  diarrhoea  \n loss of appetite \n \n If necessary,  paracetamol  can also be used to treat any fever or discomfort your child has. \n However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0\u2013 such as  ibuprofen  \u2013 shouldn't be used if your child has a UTI, as they can harm the kidneys. Aspirin should never be given to children under the age of 16. \n If your child is\u00a0unable to swallow tablets or capsules, they\u00a0can be given antibiotics and paracetamol in liquid form. \n Your child's condition will usually improve within 24 to 48 hours of treatment. However, it's very important they finish the whole prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent the infection recurring. \n Treatment in hospital \n If your child is less than three months old or it's\u00a0thought their condition could get worse, they'll be referred to hospital for treatment. \n Doctors may feel\u00a0your\u00a0child is at risk of becoming more seriously ill without hospital treatment if: \n \n they appear to be very unwell, or they are  dehydrated  or unable to\u00a0keep down oral medication because\u00a0they keep\u00a0vomiting \n they display unusual symptoms, such as reduced urine flow,\u00a0 high blood pressure (hypertension) ,\u00a0or a noticeable lump or mass in their tummy (abdomen) or bladder \n they were previously diagnosed with a condition that affects their urinary system \n \n In these cases, your child usually needs to stay in hospital for a few days to receive\u00a0antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenous antibiotics).

Make sure nothing touches the open rim of the bottle, as this could affect the result. \n If you're unable to collect a clean sample, it may be collected using a special absorbent pad that you put in your baby's nappy. A urine sample is then sucked out of the pad using a syringe. \n If a urine sample is very difficult to collect at home or in a GP surgery, you may need to go to a hospital. \n In such cases, a urine sample can be obtained by inserting a small plastic tube called a catheter\u00a0into your child's urethra. \n Further tests \n In most cases, treatment begins soon after a urine sample has been taken and your child won't need any further tests. \n However, there are some circumstances where further tests may be carried out, including if: \n \n your child is less than six months old \n there's no improvement in your child's symptoms within 24 to 48 hours of treatment \n your child has any unusual symptoms,\u00a0such as reduced urine flow,  high blood pressure (hypertension) , or a noticeable lump or mass in their tummy (abdomen) or bladder \n your child has repeated UTIs \n \n In these cases, doctors may recommend carrying out some scans to look for any abnormalities. \n Scans \n There are many different scans that may be carried out to check for problems in your child's urinary tract, including: \n \n an  ultrasound scan \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where sound waves emitted by a special probe move over your child's skin and are used to build up a picture of the inside of their body \n a\u00a0dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where your child is injected with a slightly radioactive substance called DMSA that shows up on a special device called a gamma camera, which takes pictures of your child's kidneys; after the scan, the DMSA will pass harmlessly out of your child's body in their urine \n a\u00a0micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG)\u00a0\u2013 where a \u00a0 catheter is used to pass a special type of liquid (contrast agent) that shows up clearly on\u00a0 X-rays \u00a0into your child's bladder while\u00a0a series of X-rays are taken; as with the\u00a0DMSA scan, the contrast agent will pass harmlessly\u00a0out of your child's body in their urine \n \n The type of scans used and when they're carried out depends on your child's specific circumstances.

In the UK, it affects 15 in every 1,000 women and\u00a01 in 1,000 men. Children can also develop an underactive thyroid. \n Around 1 in 3,500-4,000 babies\u00a0are born with an\u00a0underactive thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism).\u00a0All babies born in the UK are screened for congenital hypothyroidism\u00a0using a\u00a0 blood spot test  when the baby is about five days old. \n Treating an underactive thyroid \n Treatment for an underactive thyroid involves taking daily\u00a0hormone replacement tablets, called levothyroxine,\u00a0to raise your\u00a0thyroxine levels. You'll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life. \n If an underactive thyroid isn't treated, it can lead to complications, including  heart disease ,\u00a0goitre, pregnancy problems and a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare). \n Read more about  treating an underactive thyroid \u00a0and the  complications of an underactive thyroid", "symptoms": "Many symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else. \n Symptoms\u00a0usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years. \n Common symptoms include: \n \n tiredness \n being sensitive to cold \n weight gain \n  constipation  \n  depression  \n slow movements and thoughts \n muscle aches and weakness \n muscle cramps \n dry and scaly skin \n brittle hair and nails \n  loss of libido (sex drive)  \n pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome) \n irregular periods\u00a0or heavy periods \n \n Elderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression.

This damages the thyroid, which means it's not able to make enough of the hormone thyroxine,\u00a0leading to the  symptoms of an underactive thyroid   . \n A condition called Hashimoto's disease is the most common type of autoimmune reaction\u00a0that\u00a0causes an underactive thyroid. \n It's not clear what causes Hashimoto\u2019s disease, but it runs in families. It's also common in people with another immune system disorder, such as  type 1 diabetes  and vitiligo. \n Previous thyroid treatment \n An underactive thyroid can also occur as a side effect or complication of previous treatment to the thyroid gland, such as surgery or a treatment called radioactive iodine therapy. \n These treatments are sometimes used for an overactive thyroid\u00a0(where the thyroid gland\u00a0produces too much hormone) or thyroid cancer. \n Less common causes \n Worldwide,\u00a0a\u00a0lack of dietary\u00a0iodine is a common cause of an underactive thyroid, because the body needs iodine to make thyroxine. However, iodine deficiency is\u00a0uncommon in the UK. \n Babies are sometimes born with an underactive thyroid because the thyroid gland doesn't develop properly in the womb. This is called congenital hypothyroidism and is\u00a0uncommon, affecting around 1 in 3,000 babies. It's\u00a0usually picked up during routine screening soon after birth. \n A problem with the pituitary gland could lead to an underactive thyroid.\u00a0The pituitary gland sits at the base of the brain and\u00a0regulates the thyroid. Therefore, damage to the pituitary gland may lead to an underactive thyroid. \n An underactive thyroid has also been linked to\u00a0some viral infections or some\u00a0medications used to treat other conditions, such as: \n \n lithium \u2013 a medication sometimes used to treat certain mental health conditions, including  depression \u00a0and\u00a0 bipolar disorder  \n amiodarone \u2013 a medication sometimes used to treat irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) \n interferons \u2013 a class of medication sometimes used to treat certain types of\u00a0 cancer  and  hepatitis C  \n \n Speak to your GP or specialist if you're concerned that a medication you're taking may be affecting your thyroid hormone levels.", "treatment": "An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine. \n Levothyroxine\u00a0replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid doesn't make enough of. \n You'll initially have regular\u00a0 blood tests  until the correct dose\u00a0of levothyroxine is reached.

In these cases, your GP will usually monitor your hormone levels every few months and prescribe levothyroxine if you develop symptoms. \n Taking levothyroxine \n If you're prescribed levothyroxine, you should take one tablet at the same time every day.\u00a0It's usually recommended that you take the tablets in the morning, although some people prefer to take them at night. \n The effectiveness of the\u00a0tablets can be altered by other medications, supplements or foods, so they should be swallowed with water on an empty stomach, and you should avoid eating for 30 minutes afterwards. \n If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, if this is within a few hours of your usual time. If you don't remember until later than this, skip the dose and take the next dose at the usual time, unless\u00a0advised otherwise by your doctor. \n An underactive thyroid is a lifelong condition, so you'll usually need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life. \n If you're prescribed levothyroxine because you have an underactive thyroid, you're entitled to a medical exemption certificate. This means you don't have to pay for your prescriptions.\u00a0 \n Side effects \n Levothyroxine doesn't usually have any side effects, because the tablets simply replace a missing hormone. \n Side effects usually only occur if you're taking too much levothyroxine. This can cause problems including\u00a0sweating,  chest pain ,  headaches ,  diarrhoea  and vomiting. \n Tell your doctor if you develop new symptoms while taking levothyroxine. You should also let them know if your symptoms get worse or don't improve. \n Combination therapy \n In the UK, combination therapy \u2013 using levothyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) together \u2013 isn't routinely used because there's insufficient evidence to show it\u2019s better than using levothyroxine alone (monotherapy). \n In most cases,\u00a0suppressing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using high dose thyroid replacement therapy should be avoided because it carries a risk of causing adverse side effects, such as\u00a0 atrial fibrillation  (an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate),  strokes ,  osteoporosis  and fracture. \n However, this type of treatment may sometimes be recommended in cases where a person has a history of\u00a0 thyroid cancer  and there\u2019s a significant risk of it reoccurring.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It's very important that an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is diagnosed as soon as possible. \n Low levels of thyroid-producing hormones, such as\u00a0triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), can change the way the body processes fat. \n This can cause\u00a0 high cholesterol  and  atherosclerosis (clogging of the arteries) , which can potentially lead to serious heart-related problems, such as\u00a0 angina  and  heart attack . \n Therefore, you should see your GP and ask for a\u00a0 blood test \u00a0if you repeatedly have  symptoms of an underactive thyroid . \n Thyroid function test \n A\u00a0blood test measuring your hormone levels is the only accurate way to find out whether\u00a0there's a problem. \n The test, called a thyroid function test, looks at levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) in the blood. \n A\u00a0high level of TSH and a low level of\u00a0T4 in the blood\u00a0could mean you have\u00a0an underactive thyroid. \n If your test results show raised TSH but normal\u00a0T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future. \n Your GP may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid. \n Blood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called\u00a0triiodothyronine (T3).

This means you may have\u00a0type 2 diabetes for many years without realising it. \n Early diagnosis and treatment for type 2 diabetes is very important as it may reduce your risk of developing complications later on. \n Hyperglycaemia \n Type 2 diabetes occurs when the\u00a0pancreas, a\u00a0large gland behind the stomach, can't produce enough insulin to control your blood glucose level, or when the cells in your body don't respond properly to the insulin that is produced. \n This means your blood glucose levels may become very high, and\u00a0is known as  hyperglycaemia . \n Hyperglycaemia can occur for several reasons, including: \n \n eating too much \n being unwell \n ineffective diabetes medication,\u00a0or not taking enough \n \n Hyperglycaemia causes the main symptoms\u00a0of diabetes, which include extreme thirst and frequent urination.", "causes": "Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glucose level, or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced (insulin resistance). \n The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach that produces the hormone insulin. Insulin moves glucose from your blood into your cells, where it's converted into energy. \n In type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. \n Risk factors for type 2 diabetes \n Four of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are: \n \n age \u2013\u00a0being over the age of 40 (over 25 for south Asian people)\u00a0\u00a0 \n genetics \u2013\u00a0having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister \n weight \u2013\u00a0being overweight or obese \n ethnicity \u2013\u00a0being of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African origin, even if you were born in the UK \n \n These four risk factors are discussed in more detail below.\u00a0 \n Age \n Your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. This may be because people tend to gain weight and exercise less as they get older. \n Maintaining a\u00a0healthy weight by eating a\u00a0 healthy, balanced diet  and  exercising regularly  are ways of preventing and managing diabetes. \n White\u00a0people over the age of 40 have an increased risk of developing the condition. People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African descent\u00a0have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes at a much earlier age. \n However, despite increasing age being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, over recent years younger people\u00a0from all ethnic groups have been developing the condition. \n It's also becoming more common for children\u00a0\u2013 as young as seven in some cases\u00a0\u2013 to develop type 2 diabetes. \n Genetics \n Genetics is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a close relative\u00a0such as a parent, brother or sister\u00a0who has the condition. \n The closer the relative, the greater the risk. A child who has\u00a0a parent with type 2 diabetes has\u00a0about a one in three chance of also developing the condition. \n Being overweight or obese \n You're more likely to develop\u00a0type 2 diabetes if you're overweight or obese with a\u00a0body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more. \n Fat around your tummy (abdomen) particularly increases your risk. This is because it releases chemicals that can upset the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems. \n This increases your risk of developing a number of serious conditions, including  coronary\u00a0heart disease ,  stroke  and some types of  cancer . \n Measuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. This is a measure of abdominal  obesity , which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity. \n Women have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their waist measures 80cm (31.5 inches) or more. \n Asian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches)\u00a0or\u00a0more have a higher risk, as do white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more. \n Exercising regularly and reducing your body weight by about 5% could reduce your risk of getting diabetes by more than 50%. \n Read information and advice about  losing weight  \n Ethnicity \n People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black\u00a0African origin are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. \n Type 2 diabetes\u00a0is up to six times more common in south Asian communities than in the general UK population, and it's three times more common among people of African and African-Caribbean origin. \n People of south Asian\u00a0and\u00a0African-Caribbean origin also have an increased risk of\u00a0developing  complications of diabetes , such as heart disease, at a younger age than the rest of the population. \n Other risks \n Your risk of\u00a0developing type 2 diabetes\u00a0is also increased\u00a0if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. \n This is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and\u00a0doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). \n Pre-diabetes\u00a0can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don't take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. These include  eating healthily ,  losing weight  if you're overweight, and taking plenty of\u00a0 regular exercise . \n Women who have had gestational diabetes\u00a0during pregnancy also have a\u00a0greater risk of developing diabetes in later life.", "treatment": "Medicines for type 2 diabetes \n Type 2 diabetes usually gets worse over time. Making lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your diet and taking more exercise, may help you control your blood glucose levels at first, but may not be enough in the long term. \n You may eventually need to take medication to help control your blood glucose levels. \n Initially, this will usually be in the form of tablets and can sometimes be a combination of more than one type of tablet. It may also include insulin or another medication that you inject. \n Metformin \n Metformin is usually the first medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream. It also makes your body's cells more responsive to insulin. \n Metformin is recommended for adults with a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and\u00a0whose blood glucose is still progressing towards type 2 diabetes, despite making necessary lifestyle changes. \n If you're overweight, it's also likely you'll be prescribed metformin. Unlike some other medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, metformin shouldn't cause additional weight gain. \n However, it can sometimes cause mild side effects, such as nausea and  diarrhoea , and you may not be able to take it if you have kidney damage. \n Sulphonylureas \n Sulphonylureas increase the amount of insulin that's produced by your pancreas. \n Examples include: \n \n glibenclamide \n gliclazide \n glimepiride \n glipizide \n gliquidone \n \n You may be prescribed one of these medicines if you can't take metformin or if you aren't overweight. \n Alternatively, you may be prescribed sulphonylurea and metformin if metformin doesn't control blood glucose on its own. \n Sulphonylureas can increase the risk of  hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)  because they increase the amount of insulin in your body. They can also sometimes cause side effects, including weight gain, nausea and diarrhoea. \n Pioglitazone \n Pioglitazone is a type of thiazolidinedione medicine (TZD), which make your body's cells more sensitive to insulin so more glucose is taken from your blood. \n It's usually used in combination with metformin or sulphonylureas, or both.\u00a0It may cause weight gain and ankle swelling (oedema). \n You shouldn't take pioglitazone if you have  heart failure  or a high risk of bone fracture. \n Gliptins (DPP-4 inhibitors) \n Gliptins work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring hormone called GLP-1. \n GLP-1 helps the body produce insulin in response to high blood glucose levels, but is rapidly broken down. \n By preventing this breakdown, the gliptins (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) prevent high blood glucose levels, but don't result in episodes of hypoglycaemia. \n You may be prescribed a gliptin if you're unable to take sulphonylureas or glitazones, or in combination with them. They're not associated with weight gain. \n SGLT2 inhibitors \n SGLT2 inhibitors work by increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine. They may be considered to treat type 2 diabetes if metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors aren't suitable. \n The three SGLT2 inhibitors\u00a0that may be prescribed include: \n \n dapagliflozin \n canagliflozin \n empagliflozin \n \n Each medication is taken as a tablet once a day. The main side effect is a higher risk of genital and urinary tract infections. \n Read more about these\u00a0 three new treatment options for type 2 diabetes  on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. \n GLP-1 agonists \n GLP-1 agonists acts in a similar way to the natural hormone GLP-1 (see the section on gliptins, above). \n They're given by\u00a0injection and boost insulin production when there are high blood glucose levels, reducing blood glucose without the risk of hypoglycaemia episodes (\"hypos\"). \n Acarbose \n Acarbose helps prevent your blood glucose level increasing too much after you eat a meal. It slows down the rate at which your digestive system breaks carbohydrates down into glucose. \n Acarbose isn't often used to treat type 2 diabetes because it usually causes side effects, such as bloating and diarrhoea. \n However, it may be prescribed if you can't take other types of medicine for type 2 diabetes. \n Nateglinide and repaglinide \n Nateglinide and repaglinide stimulate the release of insulin by your pancreas. They're not commonly used, but may be an option if you have meals at irregular times. \n This is because their effects don't last very long, but they're effective when taken just before you eat. \n Nateglinide and repaglinide can cause side effects, such as weight gain and hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). \n Insulin treatment \n If glucose-lowering tablets aren't effective in controlling your blood glucose levels, you may need to have insulin treatment. \n This can be taken instead of or alongside your tablets, depending on the dose and the way you take it. \n Insulin comes in several different preparations, and each works slightly differently. \n For example, some last up to a whole day (long-acting), some last up to eight hours (short-acting) and some work quickly but don't last very long (rapid-acting). \n Your treatment may include a combination of these different insulin preparations. \n Insulin injections \n Insulin must be injected because\u00a0it would be broken down in your stomach like food and unable to enter your bloodstream if it were taken as a tablet. \n If you need to inject insulin, your diabetes care team will advise you about when you need to do it. \n They will show you how to inject it yourself, and will also give you advice about storing your insulin and disposing of your needles properly. \n Insulin injections are given using either a syringe or an injection pen, also called an insulin pen (auto-injector). Most people need between two and four injections of insulin a day. \n Your GP or diabetes nurse will also teach a relative or a close friend how to inject the insulin properly. \n You can read more about  insulin and how to inject it  on the  Diabetes UK  website. \n Treatment for low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) \n If you have type 2 diabetes that's controlled using insulin or certain types of tablets, you may experience episodes of  hypoglycaemia . \n Hypoglycaemia is where your blood glucose levels become very low. \n Mild hypoglycaemia (a \"hypo\") can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, but it can usually be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary. \n If you have a hypo, you should initially have a form of carbohydrate that will act quickly, such as a sugary drink or glucose tablets. \n This should be followed by a longer-acting carbohydrate, such as a cereal bar, sandwich or piece of fruit. \n In most cases, these measures will be enough to raise your blood glucose level to normal, although it may take a few hours. \n If you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you may become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. \n If this occurs, you may need to have an injection of glucagon into your muscle or glucose into a vein. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels. \n Your diabetes care team can advise you on how to avoid a hypo and what to do if you have one. \n Other treatments \n If you have type 2 diabetes, your risk of developing  heart disease ,  stroke  and  kidney disease  is increased. \n To reduce your risk of developing other serious health conditions, you may be advised to take other medicines, including: \n \n anti-hypertensive medicines to control  high blood pressure  \n a  statin , such as simvastatin or atorvastatin, to reduce  high cholesterol  \n low-dose aspirin to prevent a  stroke  \n an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril, if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease \n \n Diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of albumin (a protein) in your urine. If treated early enough, it may be reversible. \n Monitoring blood glucose levels \n If you have type 2 diabetes, your GP or diabetes care team will need to take a reading of your blood glucose level about every two to six months. \n This will show how stable your glucose levels have been in the recent past and how well your treatment plan is working. \n The HbA1c test is used to measure blood glucose levels over the previous two to three months. \n HbA1c is a form of haemoglobin, the chemical that carries oxygen in red blood cells, which also has glucose attached to it. \n A high HbA1c level means that your blood glucose level has been consistently high over recent weeks, and your diabetes treatment plan may need to be changed. \n Your diabetes care team can help you set a target HbA1c level to aim for. This will usually be less than 59mmol/mol (7.5%). However, it can be as low as 48mmol/mol (6.5%) for some people. \n Read more about the  HbA1c test  \n Monitoring your own blood glucose \n If you have type 2 diabetes, as well as having your blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional every two to six months, you may be advised to monitor your own blood glucose levels at home. \n Even if you have a healthy diet and are taking tablets or using insulin therapy, exercise, illness and stress can affect your blood glucose levels. \n Other factors that may affect your blood glucose levels include drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. \n A blood glucose meter is a small device that measures the concentration of glucose in your blood. It can be useful\u00a0for detecting  high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) \u00a0or  low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) . \n If blood glucose monitoring is recommended, you should be trained in how to use a blood glucose meter and what you should do if the reading is too high or too low. \n Blood glucose meters aren't currently available for free on the NHS but, in some cases, blood monitoring strips may be. Ask a member of your diabetes care team if you're unsure. \n  Diabetes UK  also provides further information about the  availability of blood glucose test strips (PDF, 195kb) . \n Regularly monitoring your blood glucose levels will ensure your blood glucose is as normal and stable as possible. \n As your blood glucose level is likely to vary throughout the day, you may need to check it several times a day, depending on the treatment you're taking. \n In home testing, blood glucose levels are usually measured by how many millimoles of glucose are in a litre of blood. \n A millimole is a measurement used to define the concentration of glucose in your blood. The measurement is expressed as millimoles per litre, or mmol/l for short. \n A normal blood glucose level is 4-6 mmol/l before meals (preprandial) and less than 10 mmol/l two hours after meals (postprandial), although this can vary from person to person. \n Your diabetes care team can discuss your blood glucose level with you in more detail.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Type 1 diabetes", "introduction": "Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. \n The hormone insulin \u2013 produced by the pancreas \u2013 is responsible for controlling the amount of glucose in the blood. \n There are two main types of diabetes: \n \n Type 1 \u2013 where the pancreas doesn't produce any insulin \n Type 2 \u2013 where the pancreas\u00a0doesn't produce\u00a0enough insulin or the body\u2019s cells don't react to insulin \n \n This\u00a0topic is about type 1 diabetes. \n Read more about  type 2 diabetes  \n Another\u00a0type of diabetes, known as\u00a0gestational diabetes, occurs in some pregnant women and tends to disappear following birth. \n It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because it will get progressively worse if left untreated. \n You should therefore visit your GP if you have symptoms, which include feeling thirsty, passing urine more often than usual and feeling tired all the time (see the list below for more diabetes symptoms).\u00a0 \n Type 1 and type 2 diabetes \n Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. Around 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it's the most common type of\u00a0childhood diabetes. This is why\u00a0it's sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes.\u00a0 \n In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas (a small gland behind the stomach) doesn't produce any insulin \u2013 the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels.\u00a0This is why it's also sometimes called insulin-dependent diabetes. \n If the amount of glucose in the blood is too high, it can, over time, seriously damage the body's organs. \n In\u00a0type 2 diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. Around 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2, and it tends to develop later in life than type 1. \n Diabetes\u00a0symptoms \n The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means that glucose stays in the blood and isn\u2019t used as fuel for energy. \n Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine. \n Typical symptoms include: \n \n feeling very\u00a0 thirsty  \n passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night \n feeling very tired \n weight loss and loss of muscle bulk \n \n The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop very quickly in young people\u00a0(over a few days or weeks). In adults, the symptoms often take longer to develop (a few months). \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of type 1 diabetes  \n Causes of type 1 diabetes\u00a0 \n Type 1 diabetes occurs as a result of the body being unable to\u00a0produce insulin, which moves glucose out of the blood and into your cells to be used for\u00a0energy. \n Without insulin, your body will break down its own fat and muscle, resulting in\u00a0weight loss. This can lead to a serious short-term condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the bloodstream becomes acidic and you develop dangerous levels of  dehydration . \n Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, where the\u00a0immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them. \n Read more about the  causes of type 1 diabetes  \n Treating type 1 diabetes \n It's important that\u00a0diabetes is\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0as early as possible, so that treatment can be started. \n Diabetes can't be cured, but treatment aims to keep your blood glucose levels as normal as possible and control your symptoms, to prevent health problems developing later in life. \n If you're\u00a0diagnosed with diabetes, you'll be referred to\u00a0a diabetes care team for specialist treatment and monitoring. \n As your body can't produce insulin, you'll need regular insulin injections to keep your glucose levels normal. You'll be taught how to do this and how to match the insulin you inject to the food you eat, taking into account your blood glucose level and how much exercise you do. \n Insulin injections\u00a0come in several different forms, with each working slightly differently. Some last up to a whole day (long-acting), some last up to eight hours (short-acting) and some work quickly but don't last very long (rapid-acting). You'll most likely\u00a0need a combination of different insulin preparations. \n There are alternatives to insulin injections, but they're only suitable for a small number of patients. They are: \n \n insulin pump therapy \u2013 where a small device constantly pumps\u00a0insulin\u00a0(at a rate you control) into your bloodstream through a needle that's inserted under the skin \n islet cell transplantation \u2013 where healthy insulin-producing cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor are implanted into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes (read about the criteria for having an islet transplant) \n a complete pancreas transplant \n \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing diabetes \u00a0and  treating type 1 diabetes  \n Complications \n If diabetes is\u00a0left untreated, it can cause a number of different health problems. Large amounts of glucose can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs. \n Even a mildly raised glucose level that doesn't cause any symptoms can have damaging effects in the\u00a0long term. \n Read more about the  complications of type 1 diabetes  \n Living with diabetes \n If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to look after your health very carefully. Caring for your health will also make treating your diabetes easier and minimise your risk of developing complications. \n For example, eating\u00a0a\u00a0 healthy, balanced diet  and  exercising regularly  will\u00a0lower your blood glucose level.\u00a0 Stopping smoking \u00a0(if you smoke) will also reduce your\u00a0risk of developing  cardiovascular disease . \n If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be\u00a0 invited to have their eyes screened  once a year. \n Read more about  living with diabetes", "symptoms": "The symptoms of type 1 diabetes can develop very quickly (over a few days or weeks), particularly in children. \n In older adults, the symptoms\u00a0can often take longer to develop (a few months). \n However, they should disappear when you start taking insulin and you get the condition\u00a0under control. \n The main symptoms of\u00a0 diabetes  are: \n \n feeling very  thirsty  \n urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night \n feeling very tired \n weight loss and loss of muscle bulk \n itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of  thrush  (a yeast infection) \n blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape \n slow healing of cuts and grazes \n \n Vomiting or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for treatment. \n When to seek urgent medical attention \n You should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop: \n \n a loss of appetite \n nausea or vomiting \n a high temperature \n stomach pain \n fruity smelling breath \u2013 which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (others will usually be able to smell it, but you won't) \n \n Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) \n If you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. This is known as\u00a0 hypoglycaemia  (or a \"hypo\"), and it's triggered when injected insulin in your body moves too much glucose out of your bloodstream. \n In most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink  alcohol  on an empty stomach. \n Symptoms of a \"hypo\" include: \n \n feeling shaky and irritable \n sweating \n tingling lips \n feeling weak \n feeling confused\u00a0 \n hunger \n nausea (feeling sick) \n \n A hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary. \n If it\u00a0isn't brought under control, a hypo\u00a0can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness. \n In this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed.\u00a0Glucagon\u00a0increases the glucose in your blood. \n Hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) \n As diabetes occurs as a result of your\u00a0body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there's insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy. \n If your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience\u00a0 hyperglycaemia . The symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and\u00a0be more severe. They include: \n \n extreme thirst \n a\u00a0 dry mouth  \n blurred vision \n drowsiness \n a need to pass urine frequently\u00a0 \n \n Left untreated, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a serious condition, where\u00a0the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. This leads\u00a0to a build-up of acids in your blood,\u00a0which can cause vomiting,  dehydration , unconsciousness and even death. \n The\u00a0 Diabetes UK  website has more information about  diabetes symptoms .", "causes": "Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that's needed to control the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood. \n When you eat, your digestive system breaks down food and passes its nutrients \u2013 including glucose \u2013 into your bloodstream. \n The pancreas\u00a0(a small gland behind your stomach) usually produces\u00a0insulin, which\u00a0transfers any glucose out of your blood and into your cells, where it's converted\u00a0to\u00a0energy. \n However, if you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas is unable to\u00a0produce any insulin (see below). This means that glucose can't be moved out of your bloodstream and into your cells. \n Autoimmune condition \n Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Your immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) mistakes the cells in your pancreas as harmful and attacks them, destroying them completely or damaging them enough to stop them producing insulin. \n It's not known exactly what triggers the immune system to do this, but some researchers have suggested that it may be due to a viral infection. \n Type 1 diabetes is often\u00a0inherited (runs in families), so the autoimmune reaction\u00a0may also be genetic. \n If you have a close relative \u2013 such as a parent, brother or sister \u2013 with type 1 diabetes, you have about\u00a0a 6% chance of also developing the condition. The risk for people who don't have a close relative with type 1 diabetes is just under\u00a00.5%.", "treatment": "Monitoring blood glucose \n An important part of your treatment is to make sure that your blood sugar level is as normal and stable as possible. \n You'll be able to manage this using insulin treatment and by eating a  healthy, balanced diet , but you will also have to regularly check your blood glucose levels to make sure they're not too high or too low. \n Exercise, illness, stress, drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and, for women, changes to your hormone levels during your monthly period can all affect your blood sugar levels. \n In most cases, you'll need to check your blood glucose levels during the day, both at home and at work or school,\u00a0using a simple finger prick blood test. You may need to do this up to four or more times a day, depending on the type of insulin treatment you're taking. Your diabetes care team will talk to you about your ideal blood glucose level. \n The normal blood sugar level is 4.0-7.0 mmol/l before meals and less than 9.0 mmol/l two hours after meals. Mmol/l means millimoles per litre, and it's a way of defining the concentration of glucose in your blood. \n The\u00a0 Diabetes UK  website has more information on\u00a0 testing your glucose levels . \n Having your blood glucose levels checked \n You'll be measuring\u00a0your blood glucose yourself every day, to check your levels. \n Your GP or diabetes care team will also carry out a different blood test every two to six months, called the HbA1c test. \n This gives a\u00a0clearer idea of how well your treatment plan is working, by measuring how stable your glucose levels have been over the past 6-12 weeks. \n It measures the amount of haemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells that has glucose attached to it. A high HbA1c level may indicate that your blood glucose level is consistently high and that your diabetes treatment plan needs to be altered. \n The ideal HbA1c target for people with diabetes is below 48 mmol/mol. \n The  Diabetes UK  website has more information about  blood glucose levels . \n Treating hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) \n  Hypoglycaemia \u00a0can occur when your blood glucose level becomes very low. It's likely that you'll develop hypoglycaemia from time to time. \n Mild hypoglycaemia (or a \"hypo\") can make you feel shaky, weak and hungry, and can be controlled by eating or drinking something sugary, such as a fizzy drink (not a diet version), sugar cubes or raisins. You may also be able to take pure glucose, in the form of a tablet or fluid, if you need to control the symptoms of a hypo quickly. \n If you develop severe hypoglycaemia, you can become drowsy and confused, and you may even lose consciousness. If this occurs, you'll need assistance from another person who may be able to give you a glucose gel rubbed into your cheeks or an injection of glucagon into your muscle. Glucagon is a hormone that quickly increases your blood glucose levels. \n Your diabetes care team may show several of your family members and close friends how to inject glucagon or give you glucose gel, should you need it. \n Once you begin to come round, you'll need to eat something sugary when you're alert enough to do so. If you lose consciousness as a result of hypoglycaemia, there's a risk that it could happen again within a few hours, so you'll need to rest afterwards and have someone with you. \n If the glucagon injection into your muscle doesn't work, and you're still drowsy or unconscious 10 minutes after the injection, you'll need urgent medical attention. \n You'll need to have another injection of glucagon straight into a vein, which must be given by a trained healthcare professional. \n If you have type 1 diabetes, it's recommended that you carry identification with you so that people are aware of the problem if you become hypoglycaemic. \n Islet cell transplantation \n Some people with type 1 diabetes may benefit from a fairly new procedure known as islet cell transplantation. It involves implanting healthy islet cells from the pancreas of a deceased donor into the pancreas of someone with type 1 diabetes. \n In 2008, a government-funded islet cell transplant programme was introduced, and the procedure is now available through the NHS for people who satisfy certain criteria (see below). \n You may be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you've had: \n \n two or more severe hypos within the last two years and you have a poor awareness of hypoglycaemia \n a working kidney transplant, severe hypos and poor hypoglycaemia awareness, or poor blood glucose control even after receiving the best medical treatment \n \n You may not be suitable for an islet cell transplant if you: \n \n weigh over 85kg (13st 5.4lb) \n have poor kidney function \n need a lot of insulin \u2013 for example, over 50 units a day for a 70kg (11st) person \n \n An islet cell transplant is a minor, low-risk procedure that's carried out under  local anaesthetic . \n The procedure has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of severe hypos. So far, the results of islet cell transplants carried out in the UK have shown a significant reduction in the number of hypos, from 23 per person per year before transplantation to less than one per person per year afterwards. \n The  Diabetes UK \u00a0website has more information about  islet cell transplants  and  hypoglycaemia . \n Pancreas transplant \n People with type 1 diabetes who are having a kidney transplant from a donor may also be offered a pancreas transplant at the same time. \n Others may be offered a pancreas transplant after they've had a kidney transplant because they\u2019re already on anti-rejection tablets. \n If you're having repeated, severe and\u00a0life-threatening hypoglycaemic attacks, a\u00a0pancreas transplant may also be recommended. \n During the procedure, your faulty pancreas will be replaced with a healthy pancreas from a donor. This will allow you\u00a0to get a new source of insulin. \n Pancreas transplants are complicated operations and, like other types of major surgery, there's a risk of complications. In the UK, about 200 pancreas transplants are carried out\u00a0each year, with more than 300 people on the waiting list. \n The waiting time for a pancreas transplant is one to two years, because there's a shortage of suitable donor organs. \n Treating hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) \n  Hyperglycaemia \u00a0can occur when your blood glucose levels become too high. It can happen for several reasons, such as eating too much, being unwell or not taking enough insulin. \n If you develop hyperglycaemia, you may need to adjust your diet or your insulin\u00a0dose to keep your glucose levels normal. Your diabetes care team can advise you about the best way to do this. \n If hyperglycaemia isn't treated, it can lead to a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, where the body begins to break down fats for energy instead of glucose, resulting in a build-up of ketones (acids) in your blood. \n Diabetic ketoacidosis is very serious and, if not addressed quickly, it can lead to unconsciousness and, eventually, death. \n The signs of diabetic ketoacidosis include: \n \n frequently passing urine \n thirst \n tiredness and lethargy (lack of energy) \n blurry vision \n abdominal (stomach) pain \n nausea and vomiting \n deep breathing \n smell of ketones on breath (described as smelling like pear drops) \n collapse and unconsciousness \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis  \n Your healthcare team will educate you on how to decrease your risk of ketoacidosis by testing your own blood for ketones using blood ketone sticks if you're unwell. \n If you develop diabetic ketoacidosis, you'll need urgent hospital treatment. You'll be given insulin directly into a vein (intravenously). You may also need other fluids given by a drip if you're dehydrated, including salt solution and potassium. \n Other treatments \n Type 1 diabetes can lead to long-term complications. If you have the condition, you have an increased risk of developing  heart disease ,  stroke  and  kidney disease . To reduce the chance of this, you may be advised to take: \n \n anti-hypertensive medicines to control  high blood pressure  \n a statin \u2013 such as simvastatin \u2013 to reduce  high cholesterol levels  \n  low-dose aspirin \u00a0to prevent stroke \n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor \u2013 such as enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril if you have the early signs of diabetic kidney disease \n \n Diabetic kidney disease is identified by the presence of small amounts of a protein called albumin in your urine. It's often reversible if treated early enough. \n Care standards for diabetes \n The aim of treating diabetes is to help people with the condition control their blood glucose levels and minimise the risk of developing future complications. \n The Department of Health has set out national standards for NHS organisations and professionals covering diabetes care and prevention. \n The  Diabetes National Service Framework  was developed by diabetes clinical experts and patients with diabetes. Good diabetes care includes: \n \n access to information and appropriate support for people with type 1 diabetes, including access to a structured education programme \u2013 such as  Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE)   \n an agreed care plan, helping all people with diabetes to manage their care and lead a healthy lifestyle \u2013 including a named contact for their care \n information, care and support to enable all people with diabetes to control their blood glucose, maintain an acceptable blood pressure and minimise other risk factors for developing complications \n access to services to identify and treat possible complications \u2013 such as screening for  diabetic retinopathy  (where high blood glucose levels damage the retina at the back of the eye) and specialised foot care \n effective care for all people with diabetes admitted to hospital, for whatever reason \n \n The\u00a0 Diabetes UK  website has more information about  care from healthcare professionals .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It's important to diagnose diabetes as early as possible, so that treatment can be started. \n If you experience the  symptoms of diabetes , you should visit your GP as soon as possible. They'll ask about your symptoms and may request\u00a0a urine and\u00a0 blood test . \n Urine and blood tests \n Your urine sample will be tested to see whether it contains glucose. Urine doesn't usually contain glucose, but if you have  diabetes , some glucose can overflow through the kidneys and into the urine.\u00a0Your urine may also be tested for ketones (chemicals) that indicate type 1 diabetes. \n If your urine contains glucose, a\u00a0blood test can be used to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. A sample of your blood will be taken in the morning, before you've had anything to eat, and it will be tested to measure your blood glucose levels. \n If your blood glucose levels aren't high enough for your GP to diagnose diabetes, you may need to have an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is also sometimes referred to as a glucose tolerance test (GTT). \n After drinking\u00a0a glucose drink, samples of your blood will be\u00a0taken every half an hour, for two hours. The samples will be\u00a0tested to find out\u00a0how your body is dealing with the glucose. \n Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \n The glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test is another blood test that can be used to diagnose diabetes. \n In people who've already been diagnosed with diabetes, the HbA1c test is often used to show how well their diabetes is being controlled. \n The HbA1c test gives your average blood glucose level over the previous\u00a0two to three months. The results can indicate whether the measures you're taking to control your diabetes are working. \n Antibody tests \n There are blood tests for specific antibodies that can identify type 1 diabetes. \n If you've been diagnosed with diabetes, it's recommended that you have your HbA1c measured at least twice a year. However, you may need to have your HbA1c measured more frequently if: \n \n you've recently been diagnosed with diabetes \n your blood glucose remains too high \n your treatment plan has been changed \n \n Unlike other tests, such as the GTT, the HbA1c test can be carried out at any time of day and doesn't require any special preparation, such as fasting. However, it's less reliable in certain situations, such as during pregnancy. \n The advantages associated with the HbA1c test make it the preferred method of assessing how well blood glucose levels are being controlled in a person with diabetes. \n HbA1c is also increasingly being used as a diagnostic test for\u00a0 type 2 diabetes , and as a screening test for people at high risk of diabetes."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Trigeminal neuralgia", "introduction": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a sudden, severe facial pain, described as sharp, shooting or like an electric shock. \n It usually occurs in sudden short attacks lasting from a few seconds to about two minutes, which stop just as abruptly. \n In the vast majority of cases it affects part or all of one side of the face,\u00a0with the pain most commonly felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally it affects both sides of the face, but not normally at the same time. \n People with the condition may experience attacks of pain regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. In severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day. \n It's possible for the pain to improve or even disappear altogether for several months or years at a time (known as a period of remission), although these periods of remission tend to get shorter with time. Some people may then go on to develop a more continuous aching, throbbing and burning sensation, sometimes accompanied by the sharp attacks. \n Typically, the attacks of pain are brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind (even a slight breeze or air conditioning) or movement of the face or head. Sometimes, the pain can occur without any trigger whatsoever. \n Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult and it can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, resulting in problems such as weight loss, isolation and depression. \n Read more about the  symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia  \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as\u00a0 paracetamol  and  ibuprofen  do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes. \n Your GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. \n However, diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia can be difficult, and it can take a few years for a diagnosis to be confirmed. \n Read more about  diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia  \n What causes trigeminal neuralgia? \n In the vast majority of cases, trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the largest nerve inside the skull, which transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. \n This compression is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. \n In rare cases, trigeminal neuralgia can occur as a result of damage to the trigeminal nerve, caused by an underlying condition such as\u00a0 multiple sclerosis (MS)  or a tumour. \n Read more about the  causes of trigeminal neuralgia  \n Who is affected \n It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by trigeminal neuralgia, but the condition is thought to be rare. \n Some studies have suggested that around 27 in every 100,000 people are diagnosed with the condition in the UK each year, although this figure is probably too high as the condition tends to be over-diagnosed by doctors. Other estimates have suggested that there are about 6,500 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. \n The condition affects women more often than men and is rare in people under the age of 40, although it can occur in younger people. Most cases are first seen in people between the ages of 50 and 60. \n How trigeminal neuralgia is treated \n Trigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition, and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, most cases can be controlled to at least some degree with treatment. \n The first treatment offered will usually be with an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat\u00a0 epilepsy ) called carbamazepine. To be effective, this medication needs to be taken several times a day, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so that high enough levels of the medication can build up in your bloodstream. \n Unless your pain starts to diminish or disappears altogether, the medication is usually continued for as long as is necessary, sometimes for many years. If you are entering a period of remission and your pain goes away, stopping the medication should always be done slowly over days or weeks, unless you are advised otherwise by a doctor. \n Carbamazepine was not originally designed to treat pain, but it can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages. \n If this medication is ineffective, unsuitable or causes too many side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medications or surgical procedures that may help. \n There are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia \u2013 usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals \u2013 but these are generally only effective for a few years. \n Alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open up your skull and move away any blood vessels compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results in terms of long-term pain relief, but it is a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as\u00a0 hearing loss ,\u00a0facial numbness or, very rarely, a  stroke . \n Read more about  treating trigeminal neuralgia", "symptoms": "The main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes. \n The pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees. \n Trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye. \n You may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly. \n After the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks. \n You may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as \"remission\"). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission. \n Symptom triggers \n Attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as: \n \n talking \n smiling \n chewing \n brushing your teeth \n washing your face \n a light touch \n shaving or putting on make-up \n swallowing \n kissing \n a cool breeze or air conditioning \n head movements \n vibrations, such as walking or a car journey \n \n However, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever. \n Further problems \n Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected. \n You may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. However, it's important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse. \n The emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as  depression . During periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider  suicide . Even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning. \n When to see your GP \n You should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as  paracetamol \u00a0and  ibuprofen \u00a0do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes. \n Your GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it\u2019s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible. \n Read more about  diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia", "causes": "Although the exact cause is not known, trigeminal neuralgia is often thought to be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve or an underlying condition affecting this nerve. \n The trigeminal nerve \n The trigeminal nerve (also called the fifth cranial nerve) is the largest nerve inside the skull. You have two trigeminal nerves, one in each side of your face. Small branches from different parts of the face join into three major nerve branches. These are: \n \n the upper branch (ophthalmic) \u2013 which carries sensory information from the skin above the eye, forehead and front of the head \n the middle branch (maxillary) \u2013 which carries sensory information from the skin through the cheek, side of the nose, upper jaw, teeth and gums \n the lower branch (mandibular) \u2013 which carries sensory information from the skin through the lower jaw, teeth and gums \n \n These branches enter the skull through three different routes and then join together in what is called the Gasserian ganglion, before connecting to the brainstem in the part of the skull called the posterior fossa.\u00a0 \n Trigeminal neuralgia can involve one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary and mandibular branches are affected most often, and the ophthalmic branch is the least commonly affected. \n Pressure on the trigeminal nerve \n Evidence suggests that in up to 95% of cases, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is pressure on the trigeminal nerve close to where it enters the brain stem (the lowest part of the brain that merges with the spinal cord), past the Gasserian ganglion. \n In most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an artery or vein compressing the trigeminal nerve, although it's not known why this happens. \n It's also not clear exactly why this pressure can cause painful attacks, as not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve will experience pain. It may be that, in some people, the pressure on the nerve wears away its protective outer layer called the myelin sheath, which may cause uncontrollable pain signals to travel along the nerve.\u00a0 \n However, this does not fully explain why periods of remission (periods without symptoms) can occur and why pain relief is immediate after a successful operation to move the blood vessels away from the nerve. \n Other underlying causes \n Other reasons why the trigeminal nerve can become compressed or damaged include: \n \n a tumour (a growth or lump) \n a cyst (fluid-filled sac) \n arteriovenous malformation (an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins) \n  multiple sclerosis (MS)  \u2013 a long-term condition that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord)", "treatment": "There are a number of treatments available that can offer some relief from the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia. \n Identifying triggers and avoiding them can also help. \n Most people with trigeminal neuralgia will be prescribed medication to help control their pain, although surgery may be considered for the longer term in those cases where medication is ineffective or causes too many side effects. \n Avoid triggers \n The painful attacks associated with trigeminal neuralgia can sometimes be triggered or made worse by a number of different things. Therefore, in addition to your medical treatment, it may help to try to avoid these triggers, if possible. \n For example, if your pain is triggered by wind or even a draught in a room, it may help to avoid sitting near open windows or the source of air conditioning, and wearing a scarf wrapped around your face in windy weather. A transparent dome-shaped umbrella can also protect your face from the weather. \n Hot, spicy or cold food or drink may also trigger your pain, so avoiding these can help. Using a straw to drink warm or cold drinks may also help prevent the liquid coming into contact with the painful areas of your mouth. It is important to eat nourishing meals, however, so if you are having difficulty chewing, consider eating mushy foods or liquidising your meals.\u00a0 \n Certain foods seem to trigger attacks in some people, so you may want to consider avoiding things such as caffeine, citrus fruits and bananas. \n Medication \n As normal painkillers such as\u00a0 paracetamol  are not effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia, you will normally be prescribed an alternative medication, such as an anticonvulsant medication (usually used to treat\u00a0 epilepsy ) to help control your pain. \n These medications were not originally designed to treat pain, but they can help relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain.\u00a0 \n They need to be taken regularly, not just when the pain attacks occur, but can be stopped when the episodes of pain cease and you are in remission.\u00a0 Unless otherwise instructed by your GP or specialist, it is important to build up the dosage slowly and reduce it again gradually over a few weeks. Taking too much too soon and stopping the medication too quickly can cause serious problems. \n Initially, your GP will probably prescribe a type of anticonvulsant called carbamazepine, although a number of alternatives are available if this is ineffective or unsuitable. \n Carbamazepine \n The anticonvulsant\u00a0carbamazepine is currently the only medication licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in the UK. It can be very effective initially, but may become less effective over time. \n You will usually need to take this medicine at a low dose once or twice a day, with the dose slowly increasing up to four times a day until it provides satisfactory pain relief. \n Carbamazepine often causes side effects, which may make it difficult for some people to take. These include: \n \n tiredness and sleepiness \n  dizziness (lightheadedness)  \n difficulty concentrating and memory problems \n confusion \n feeling unsteady on your feet \n feeling sick and vomiting \n double vision \n a reduced number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leukopenia) \n allergic skin reactions, such as\u00a0urticaria (hives) \n \n You should speak to your GP if you experience any persistent or troublesome side effects while you are taking carbamazepine, especially allergic skin reactions, as these could be dangerous. \n Carbamazepine has also been linked to a number of less common but more serious side effects, including thoughts of\u00a0 self-harm  or  suicide . You should immediately report any suicidal feelings to your GP. If this is not possible, call the NHS 24  111  service.\u00a0 \n Other medications \n Carbamazepine may stop working over time. If this occurs, or if you experience significant side effects while taking it, you should be referred to a specialist to consider alternative medications or procedures. \n There are a number of specialists you may be referred to for further treatment, including neurologists specialising in headaches, neurosurgeons and pain medicine specialists (for example, at a pain clinic). \n In addition to carbamazepine, there are a number of other medications that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, including: \n \n oxcarbazepine \n lamotrigine \n gabapentin \n pregabalin \n baclofen\u00a0 \n \n None of these medications are specifically licensed for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, which means they have not undergone rigorous\u00a0clinical trials to determine whether they are effective and safe to treat the condition. \n However, this is largely only because trigeminal neuralgia is a rare condition, and clinical trials are difficult to carry out on such a painful condition because giving some people an inactive, \"dummy\" medication (placebo) to compare these medications to would be unethical and impractical. \n However, many specialists will prescribe an unlicensed medication if they think it is likely to be effective and the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks. \n If your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication to treat trigeminal neuralgia, they should inform you that it is unlicensed and discuss possible risks and benefits with you. \n With most of these medications, the side effects can be quite difficult to cope with initially. Not everyone experiences side effects, but if you do, try to persevere because they do tend to diminish with time or at least until the next dosage increase, when you may find a further period of adjustment is necessary. Talk to your GP if you are finding the side effects unbearable. \n Surgery and procedures \n If medication does not adequately control your symptoms or is causing persistently troublesome side effects, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss the different surgical and non-surgical options available to relieve your pain. \n There a number of procedures that have been used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, so you will need to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each treatment with your specialist before making a decision. It is wise to be as informed as possible and to make the choice that it right for you as an individual. \n There is no guarantee that one or any of these procedures will work for you but, once you have had a successful procedure, you won\u2019t need to take your pain medications unless the pain returns. If one procedure does not work, you can always try another or remain on your medication temporarily or permanently. \n Some of the procedures that can be used to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia are outlined below. \n Percutaneous procedures \n There are a number of procedures that can offer some relief from trigeminal neuralgia pain, at least temporarily, by inserting a needle or thin tube through the cheek and into the trigeminal nerve inside the skull. \n These are known can \"percutaneous\" (through the skin) procedures, and they are carried out using\u00a0 X-rays  to guide the needle or tube into the correct place while you are heavily sedated with medication or under a\u00a0 general anaesthetic  (where you are asleep). \n Percutaneous procedures that can be carried out to treat people with trigeminal neuralgia include: \n \n glycerol injections \u2013 where a medication called glycerol in injected around the Gasserian ganglion (where the three main branches of the trigeminal nerve join together)\u00a0 \n radiofrequency lesioning \u2013 where a needle is used to apply heat directly to the the Gasserian ganglion\u00a0 \n balloon compression \u2013 where a tiny balloon is passed along a thin tube inserted through the cheek and is inflated around the Gasserian ganglion to squeeze it; the balloon is then removed \n \n These procedures work by deliberately injuring or damaging the trigeminal nerve, which is thought to disrupt the pain signals travelling along it. You are usually able to go home the same day, following your treatment. \n Overall, all of these procedures are similarly effective in relieving trigeminal neuralgia pain, although there can be complications with each, and these vary with the procedure and the individual. The pain relief will usually only last a few years, and sometimes only a few months. Sometimes these procedures do not work at all. \n The major side effect of these procedures is numbness of part or all the side of the face, and this can vary in severity from being very numb or just pins and needles. The sensation, which can be permanent, is often similar to that following an injection at the dentist. Very rarely, you can get a combination of numbness and continuous pain called anesthesia dolorosa, which is virtually untreatable. \n The procedures also carry a risk of other short- and long-term side effects and complications, including bleeding, facial bruising, eye problems and problems moving the facial muscles. \n Stereotactic radiosurgery \n An alternative way to relieve pain by damaging the trigeminal nerve that doesn't involve inserting anything through the skin is stereotactic radiosurgery. This is a fairly new treatment that uses a concentrated beam of radiation to deliberately damage the trigeminal nerve where it enters the brainstem. \n Stereotactic radiosurgery does not require a\u00a0general anaesthetic and no cuts (incisions) are made in your cheek. \n A metal frame is attached to your head with four pins inserted around your scalp (a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  is used to numb the areas where these are inserted) and your head, complete with the frame attached, is held in a large machine for an hour or two (which may make you feel claustrophobic) while the radiation is given. The frame and pins are then removed, and you are able to go home after a short rest. \n It can take a few weeks \u2013 or sometimes many months \u2013 for this procedure to take effect, but it can offer pain relief for some people for several months or years. Studies into this treatment have shown similar results to the other procedures mentioned above. \n The most common complications associated with stereotactic radiosurgery include facial numbness and\u00a0pins and needles (paraesthesia) in the face. This can be permanent and, in some cases, very troublesome. \n Microvascular decompression \n Microvascular decompression (MVD) is an operation that can help relieve trigeminal neuralgia pain without intentionally damaging the trigeminal nerve. Instead, the procedure involves relieving the pressure placed on the nerve by blood vessels that are touching the nerve or wrapped around it. \n This is a major procedure that involves opening up the skull, and is carried out under general anaesthetic by a neurosurgeon. \n During MVD, the surgeon will make an incision in your scalp, behind your ear, and remove a small circular piece of skull bone. They will then either remove or relocate the blood vessel(s), separating them from the trigeminal nerve using an artificial pad or a sling constructed from adjoining tissue. \n For many people, this type of surgery is effective in easing or completely stopping the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. It provides the longest lasting relief, with some studies suggesting that pain only recurs in about 30% of cases within 10-20 years of surgery.\u00a0 Currently, this is the closest possible cure for trigeminal neuralgia. \n However, it's an invasive procedure and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as facial numbness, hearing loss,  stroke  and even death (in around 1 in every 200 cases). \n More information and support \n Living with a long-term and painful condition such as trigeminal neuralgia can be very difficult. \n You may find it useful to contact local or national support groups, such as the  Trigeminal Neuralgia Association UK , for more information and advice about living with the condition, and to get in touch with other people who have the condition to talk to them about their experiences. \n Research has shown that groups that have support from health care professionals provide high-quality help, which can significantly improve your ability to manage this rare condition. Learning from others how to cope can help remove the fear of more pain and reduce the risk of depression. \n However, you need to be wary of potentially unreliable information you may find elsewhere, especially if offering \u201ccures\u201d for the condition. There is a great deal of misinformation on the internet, so do your research only on reliable websites, not on open forums or on social media. \n There are a number of research projects running both in the UK and abroad to determine the cause of this condition and to find new treatments, including new medications, so there is always hope on the horizon.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "As the pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia is often felt in the jaw, teeth or gums, it is common for people to visit their dentist initially, rather than their GP. \n If you visit your dentist, they will ask you questions about your symptoms and investigate your facial pain using a dental  X-ray  and other means to look for other more common causes, such as a dental infection or cracked tooth.\u00a0 \n If the dentist cannot find a cause, it is important not to undergo unnecessary treatment such as a root canal filling or an extraction, even though you may be convinced that it is a tooth problem. If your dentist can't find anything wrong, do not try to persuade them to remove a particular tooth, as this will not solve the problem. \n Often, the diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia is made by a dentist, but if you have already seen your dentist and they have not been able to find an obvious cause of your pain, visit your GP. \n Seeing your GP \n There is no specific test for trigeminal neuralgia, so a diagnosis is largely based on your symptoms and your description of the pain. \n If you have experienced facial pain, your GP will ask you questions about your symptoms, such as how often they occur, how long the pain attacks last and which areas of your face are affected. The more details about your pain you can provide, the better. \n Your GP will consider other possible causes of your pain and may also examine your head and jaw to identify which parts are painful. \n Ruling out other conditions \n An important part of the process of diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia involves ruling out other conditions that can also cause facial pain. \n By asking about your symptoms and carrying out an examination, your GP may be able to rule out other conditions, such as: \n \n  migraine  \n joint pain in the lower jaw \n giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) \u2013 a condition in which medium and large arteries in the head and neck become inflamed and cause pain in the jaw and temples \n a possible injury to one of the facial nerves \n \n Your medical, personal and family history will also need to be taken into consideration when determining possible causes of your pain. \n For example, trigeminal neuralgia is less likely if you are under 40 years old, and\u00a0 multiple sclerosis (MS) \u00a0may be more likely if you have a family history of the condition or if you have some other form of this condition. However, trigeminal neuralgia is very unlikely to be the first symptom of MS. \u00a0 \n MRI scans \n If your GP is not sure about your diagnosis, or if you have unusual symptoms, they may refer you for a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0of your head. \n An MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of your head. It can help identify potential causes of your facial pain, such as\u00a0 sinusitis  (inflammation of the lining of the sinuses), tumours on one of the facial nerves, or nerve damage caused by MS. \n An MRI can also sometimes detect whether a blood vessel in your head is compressing one of the trigeminal nerves, which is one of the main  causes of trigeminal neuralgia . However, highly sophisticated MRI scans may be needed to show this accurately, although this may not necessarily be helpful, because not everyone with a compressed trigeminal nerve has trigeminal neuralgia."},

If you live with or care for somebody in a high-risk group, such as an elderly person\u00a0or\u00a0someone with\u00a0 diabetes  or  high blood pressure , being aware of the symptoms is even more important. \n Other possible symptoms \n Symptoms in the FAST test identify most strokes and TIAs, but they can occasionally cause different symptoms that typically appear suddenly (usually over a few seconds). \n Other signs and symptoms may include: \n \n complete paralysis of one side of the body \n sudden loss or blurring of vision\u00a0 \n dizziness \n confusion \n difficulty understanding what others are saying \n problems with balance and co-ordination\u00a0 \n  difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)  \n \n However, there may be other causes for these symptoms. \n Seeking medical advice \n In the early stages of a TIA, it's not possible to tell whether you are having a TIA or a full stroke, so it's important to phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance if you or someone else are showing symptoms. \n Even if the symptoms disappear while you are waiting for the ambulance to arrive, an assessment in a hospital should still be carried out. \n A TIA is a warning that you are at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors determine the best way to reduce the chances of this happening. \n If you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have since passed and you didn't seek medical advice at the time, you should make an urgent appointment with your GP so they can refer you for a hospital assessment, if appropriate. \n Read more about  diagnosing TIAs", "causes": "Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) occur when one of the blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. \n This interruption in the flow of blood\u00a0to the brain means that the brain\u00a0cannot carry out\u00a0some of its normal functions properly, leading to symptoms such as slurred speech and weakness. \n In TIAs, the blockage quickly\u00a0resolves and your brain's blood supply returns to normal before there's any significant damage. In a full  stroke , the blood flow to your brain is disrupted for much longer, leading to more severe damage to the brain and\u00a0longer-term problems. \n The blockage in\u00a0the blood vessels responsible for most TIAs is usually caused by a\u00a0 blood clot  that has formed elsewhere in your body and travelled to the blood vessels supplying the brain, although it can also be caused by pieces of fatty\u00a0material or air bubbles. \n In very rare cases,\u00a0TIAs can be caused by a small amount of bleeding in the brain known as a haemorrhage. \n Blood clots \n Blood clots that cause TIAs typically form in areas where\u00a0arteries have been narrowed or blocked over time by the build-up of fatty deposits known as plaques. These plaques are formed during a process called\u00a0atherosclerosis. \n As you get older, the arteries can become narrower naturally, but certain things can dangerously accelerate the process. These include: \n \n smoking \n  high blood pressure (hypertension)  \n  obesity  \n  high cholesterol levels  \n  diabetes  \n excessive alcohol consumption \n \n A\u00a0type of irregular heartbeat called  atrial fibrillation \u00a0can also cause TIAs. It can lead to the formation of blood clots that escape from the heart and become lodged in the blood vessels supplying the brain. \n Who's most at risk? \n Certain things can increase your chances of having a TIA. Some of these factors are changeable\u00a0\u2013 such as your lifestyle. \n Some of the\u00a0main\u00a0risk factors\u00a0for TIA are: \n \n age \u2013 although TIAs can\u00a0occur at any age (including in children and young adults), they are\u00a0most common in people over 60 \n ethnicity \u2013\u00a0people of south Asian, African or Caribbean descent have a higher TIA risk, partly because rates of high blood pressure are higher in these groups \n medical history \u2013 as well as the conditions mentioned above, other health conditions such as\u00a0 diabetes \u00a0can increase your risk of having a TIA \n weight and diet \u2013 your risk of having a TIA is higher if you are overweight and/or have an unhealthy diet high in fat and salt \n smoking and alcohol \u2013 smoking and/or regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can increase your TIA risk \n \n Tackling the things you can change will help to lower your risk of having a TIA, or reduce your chances or having a full stroke in the future. \n Read about  preventing TIAs", "treatment": "Although the symptoms of a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) resolve in a few minutes or hours without any specific treatment, you will need treatment to help prevent another TIA or a full  stroke  occurring in the future. \n A TIA is a warning sign that you are at a significantly increased\u00a0risk of having a full stroke in the near future,\u00a0with the highest risk\u00a0in the days and weeks following the attack. \n A stroke is a serious health condition that\u00a0can cause permanent disability and can be\u00a0fatal in some cases, but appropriate treatment following a TIA can help to reduce your risk of having one. \n Your treatment\u00a0will depend on your individual circumstances, such as your age and medical history. The healthcare team can discuss treatment options with you, and tell you about possible benefits and risks. \n It\u2019s likely that you will be advised about lifestyle changes\u00a0you can make to reduce your\u00a0stroke risk, in addition to being offered medication to treat the underlying cause of your\u00a0TIA. \n You may also need surgery as part of your treatment. \n Lifestyle changes \n There are a number of lifestyle changes you can make that may help reduce your chances of having a stroke after a TIA. \n These include: \n \n eating a healthy diet \u2013 a low-fat, reduced salt, high-fibre diet is usually recommended, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables \n exercising regularly \u2013 for most people, at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week is recommended \n stopping smoking \u2013 if you smoke, stopping may significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke in the future \n cutting down on alcohol \u2013 you should aim not to exceed the recommended alcohol\u00a0limits of\u00a0three to four\u00a0units a day\u00a0for men and\u00a0two to three\u00a0units a day for women \n \n Read more about  how lifestyle changes can help to prevent a TIA or stroke . \n Medication \n In addition to lifestyle changes, most people who have had a TIA will need to take one or more daily medications indefinitely to help reduce their chances of having a stroke or another TIA. \n Some of the main medications\u00a0used are outlined below. \n Antiplatelets \n Platelets are blood cells that help\u00a0blood to clot (thicken). If a blood vessel is damaged, platelets stick together to form a blood clot to prevent bleeding. \n Antiplatelet medicines work by reducing the ability of the platelets to stick together and form clots. If you have had a TIA, it is likely that you will\u00a0be offered antiplatelet medication. \n Two common antiplatelets offered to people who have had a TIA are\u00a0aspirin and clopidogrel. Aspirin may also sometimes be taken with\u00a0another antiplatelet medicine called dipyridamole\u00a0because this can be more effective than taking these medications separately. \n The main side effects of antiplatelet medications include  indigestion  and an\u00a0increased risk of bleeding \u2013 for example, you may bleed for longer if you cut yourself, and you may bruise easily. \n Read more about\u00a0 aspirin \u00a0and\u00a0 clopidogrel  \n Anticoagulants \n Anticoagulant medicines\u00a0can help to prevent blood clots by changing the chemical composition of the blood in a way that prevents clots. \n They are usually offered to people who have had a TIA if\u00a0the blood clot that caused your TIA originated in your heart. This is often due to a condition called  atrial fibrillation , which causes your heart to beat irregularly. \n  Warfarin , rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban are examples of anticoagulants\u00a0offered\u00a0to some people who have\u00a0had a TIA. \n A side effect of all anticoagulants is the risk of bleeding caused by the reduction in the blood's ability to clot. You may need regular  blood tests \u00a0while taking warfarin, so doctors can ensure your dose is not too high or too low. \n Antihypertensives (blood pressure medication) \n If you have\u00a0 high blood pressure (hypertension) , you will be offered a type of medication called an antihypertensive to control it. This is because high blood pressure significantly increases your risk of having a TIA or stroke. \n There are lots of different types of medicine that\u00a0can help control\u00a0your blood pressure, including: \n \n thiazide diuretics \n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n calcium channel blockers \n beta-blockers \n \n Your doctor will advise you about which antihypertensive is the most suitable for you. Some people may be offered a combination of two or three different medications. \n Read more about  treating high blood pressure  \n Statins \n If you have  high cholesterol , you will be advised to take a medicine known as a statin. Statins reduce the level of cholesterol in your blood by blocking an enzyme in the liver that produces cholesterol. \n Statins may also\u00a0help to reduce your risk of a stroke whatever your cholesterol level is, so you may be offered a statin even if your cholesterol level is not particularly high. \n Examples of statins often offered to people who have had a TIA include atorvastatin, simvastatin and rosuvastatin. \n Read more about\u00a0 statins  \n Surgery \n In some cases, a surgical procedure called a\u00a0carotid endarterectomy may be recommended after having a TIA. \n Carotid endarterectomy \n A carotid endarterectomy\u00a0is an operation that involves removing part of the lining of the carotid artery, plus any blockage that has built up in the artery. \n The carotid arteries deliver blood to your brain. When fatty deposits build up inside the carotid arteries, they become hard and narrow, making it more difficult for blood to flow through them. \n This is known as\u00a0atherosclerosis\u00a0and it can lead to TIAs and strokes if the blood supply to the brain becomes disrupted. \n By unblocking the carotid arteries in people whose arteries are moderately or severely narrowed, a\u00a0carotid endarterectomy can significantly reduce the risk of having a stroke or another\u00a0TIA.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It's important to be assessed by a healthcare professional as soon as possible if you think you have had a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). \n After an initial assessment of your symptoms, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests to help determine the cause of the TIA. \n A TIA is a warning sign that you are at risk of having a full\u00a0 stroke  in the near future, and a detailed assessment can help your doctor decide the best\u00a0way to reduce this risk. \n Initial assessment \n TIAs are often over very quickly, so you may not have any symptoms by the time you see a\u00a0doctor. \n You will be asked about the\u00a0symptoms you experienced\u00a0during the TIA and how long they lasted.\u00a0This will help to rule out other conditions that may have caused your symptoms. \n Even if you no longer have symptoms,\u00a0a neurological examination may still be needed. This involves simple tasks designed to check your strength, sensation and co-ordination skills. \n Referral to a specialist \n If a TIA is suspected,\u00a0you will be\u00a0referred to a specialist for further tests.\u00a0If you are at a particularly high risk of having a stroke or another TIA in the near future, you should be seen within 24 hours. People at a lower risk should be seen within seven days. \n You will normally be offered aspirin to take while you are waiting for specialist assessment, as this can help to reduce your risk of having a stroke or another TIA in the meantime. \n It is likely that\u00a0you will be referred to a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the brain and spine), or a consultant who specialises in strokes.\u00a0This may be in a\u00a0specialist stroke or TIA clinic. \n Tests \n Several tests may be carried out to\u00a0confirm a TIA and look for underlying problems that may have caused it. Some of these tests are described below. \n Blood pressure tests \n Your blood pressure will be checked, because  high blood pressure (hypertension)  can lead to\u00a0TIAs. \n Blood tests \n You might need  blood tests  to determine whether you have\u00a0 high cholesterol ,\u00a0and to check if you have\u00a0 diabetes . \n Electrocardiogram (ECG) \n An\u00a0 electrocardiogram (ECG)  measures your heart's\u00a0electrical activity using a number of electrodes (small, sticky patches) attached to your skin. \n An ECG can detect abnormal heart rhythms, which may be a sign of conditions such as\u00a0 atrial fibrillation (where your heart beats irregularly) ,\u00a0which can increase your risk of TIAs. \n Carotid ultrasound \n A carotid  ultrasound scan  can show if there is narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain. \n A\u00a0small probe (transducer) sends high-frequency sound waves into your body. When these sound waves bounce back, they can be used to create an image of the inside of your body. \n Brain scans \n Brain scans are not always necessary if you have had a TIA. They are normally only carried out if it's not clear which part of\u00a0your brain was affected. \n A\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0will most often be carried out in these cases. This type of scan\u00a0uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of your brain. \n Occasionally, a  computerised tomography (CT) scan \u00a0may be used if an MRI scan is not suitable for you. This type of scan uses a series of X-rays to produce an image of the inside of\u00a0brain."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Tuberculosis (TB)", "introduction": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. \n It is a serious\u00a0condition, but can be cured with proper treatment. \n TB mainly affects the lungs. However, it can affect any part of the body, including the glands, bones and nervous system. \n Symptoms of TB \n Typical symptoms of TB include: \n \n a persistent  cough  that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody \n weight loss \n night sweats \n high temperature (fever) \n tiredness and fatigue \n loss of appetite \n new swellings that haven't gone away after a few weeks \n \n You should see a GP if you have a cough that lasts\u00a0more than three weeks or if you cough up blood. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of TB \u00a0and\u00a0 diagnosing TB  \n What causes TB? \n TB is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \n TB that affects the lungs is the most contagious type, but it\u00a0usually only spreads after\u00a0prolonged exposure to someone with the illness. For example,\u00a0it often spreads within a family who live in the same house. \n In most healthy people, the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) kills the bacteria, and you have no symptoms. \n Sometimes\u00a0the immune system cannot kill the bacteria, but manages to prevent it spreading in the body. This means you will not have any symptoms, but the bacteria will remain in your body. This is known as \"latent TB\".\u00a0 \n If\u00a0the immune system fails to kill or contain the infection, it can spread within the lungs or other parts of the body and symptoms will develop within a few weeks or months. This is known as \"active TB\". \n Latent TB could develop into an active TB infection at a later date, particularly if your immune system becomes weakened. \n Read more about the  causes of TB  \n Who is affected? \n Before antibiotics were introduced, TB was a major health problem in the UK. Nowadays, the condition is much less common. \n However, in the last 20 years, TB cases have gradually increased, particularly among ethnic minority communities who are originally from countries where TB is more common. \n In 2014, more than 6,500 cases of TB were reported in England. Of these, around 4,700 affected people who were born outside the UK. \n It's estimated that around one-third of the world's population is infected with latent TB. Of these, up to 10% will become active at some point. \n How TB is treated \n With treatment, TB can usually be cured. Most people will need a course of antibiotics, usually for six months. \n Several different antibiotics are used. This is because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. If you are infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with six or more different medications may be needed. \n If you are in close contact with someone who has TB, tests may be carried out to see if you are also infected. These can include a chest  X-ray ,\u00a0 blood tests , and a skin test called the Mantoux test. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating TB  \n Tuberculosis vaccination \n The\u00a0 BCG\u00a0vaccine \u00a0can\u00a0provide effective protection against TB in up to\u00a08 out of 10\u00a0people\u00a0who are given it. \n Currently, BCG vaccinations are only recommended for groups of people who are at a higher risk of developing TB. \n This includes children living in areas with high rates of TB, or those who have close family members from countries with high TB rates, and\u00a0people under the age of 16\u00a0who are going to live and work with local people in an area with high rates of TB\u00a0for more than three months. \n It's also recommended that some people, such as healthcare workers, are vaccinated\u00a0because of\u00a0the increased risk of contracting TB while working.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) depend on where the infection occurs. \n TB usually develops slowly. Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected. \n In some cases the infection doesn't cause any symptoms, which is known as latent TB. It's called active TB if you have symptoms.\u00a0You should contact your GP if you or your child have symptoms of TB. \n Read about the  causes of tuberculosis  for more information about latent and active TB. \n Main symptoms \n General symptoms of TB include: \n \n lack of appetite and weight loss \n a high temperature (fever) \n night sweats \n extreme tiredness or fatigue \n \n These symptoms can have many different causes, however, and are not always a sign of TB. \n Additional symptoms \n TB can also cause additional symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected. \n Pulmonary TB \n Most infections affect the lungs, which can cause: \n \n a persistent  cough \u00a0that lasts more than three weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody \n  breathlessness \u00a0that gradually gets worse \n \n This is known as pulmonary TB. \n Extrapulmonary TB \n Less commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the\u00a0nervous system (brain and nerves). \n This is known as extrapulmonary TB. \n Symptoms of extrapulmonary TB vary, but can include: \n \n persistently\u00a0 swollen glands  \n  abdominal (tummy) pain  \n pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint \n confusion \n a persistent\u00a0 headache  \n seizures (fits) \n \n Extrapulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with  HIV .", "causes": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a type of bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. \n The condition is spread when a person with an active TB infection in their lungs coughs or sneezes and someone else inhales the expelled droplets, which\u00a0contain TB bacteria. \n Although it is spread in a similar way to a\u00a0 cold  or the\u00a0 flu , TB is not as contagious. You would usually have to spend prolonged periods in close contact with an infected person to catch the infection yourself. \n For example, TB infections usually spread between family members who live in the same house. It would be highly unlikely to become infected by sitting next to an infected person on a bus or train. \n Not everyone with TB is infectious. Generally, children with TB or people with TB that occurs outside the lungs (extrapulmonary TB) do not spread the infection. \n Latent or active TB \n In most healthy people the immune system is able to destroy the bacteria that cause TB. However, in some cases the bacteria infect the body but don't cause any symptoms (latent TB), or the infection begins to cause symptoms within weeks or months (active TB). \n Up to 10% of people with latent TB eventually develop active TB years after the initial infection. This usually happens when the immune system is weakened\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, during  chemotherapy . \n Who's most at risk? \n Anyone can catch TB, but people particularly at risk include those: \n \n who live in, come from, or have spent time in a country or area with high levels of TB \u2013 around three in every four TB cases in the UK affect people born outside the UK \n in prolonged close contact with someone who is infected \n living in crowded conditions \n with a condition that weakens their immune system, such as  HIV  \n having treatments that weaken the immune system, such as  corticosteroids , chemotherapy or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (used to treat some types of  arthritis \u00a0and certain gut conditions) \n who are very young or very old \u2013 the immune systems of people who are young or elderly tend to be weaker than those of healthy adults \n in poor health or with a poor diet because of lifestyle and other problems, such as drug misuse,  alcohol misuse , or homelessness", "treatment": "Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) will usually involve a long course of  antibiotics  lasting several months. \n While TB is a serious condition that can be fatal if left untreated, deaths are rare if treatment is completed. \n For most people, a hospital admission during treatment is not necessary. \n Pulmonary TB \n If you\u2019re diagnosed with active pulmonary TB (TB that affects your lungs and causes symptoms), you will be given a six-month course of a combination of antibiotics. The usual course of treatment is: \n \n two antibiotics (isoniazid and rifampicin) for six months \n two additional antibiotics (pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for the first two months \n \n It may be several weeks or months before you start to feel better. The exact length of time will depend on your overall health and the severity of your TB. \n After taking the medicine for two weeks, most people are no longer infectious and feel better. However, it is\u00a0important to continue taking your medicine exactly as prescribed and to complete the whole course of antibiotics. \n Taking medication for six months is the most effective method of ensuring the TB bacteria are killed. If you stop taking your antibiotics before you complete the course, or\u00a0you skip a dose, the TB infection may become resistant to the antibiotics. This is potentially serious, as it can be difficult to treat and will require a longer course of treatment. \n If you find it difficult to take your medication every day, your treatment team can work with you to find a solution. This may include having regular contact with your treatment team at home, the treatment clinic, or somewhere else that is more convenient. \n If\u00a0treatment is completed correctly, you should not need any further checks by a TB specialist afterwards. However, you may be given advice about spotting signs that the illness has returned, although this is rare. \n In\u00a0rare cases TB can be fatal, even with treatment. Death can occur if the lungs become too damaged to work properly. \n Extrapulmonary TB \n Extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs) can be treated using the same combination of antibiotics as those used to treat pulmonary TB. However, you may need to take them for 12 months. \n If you have TB in areas such as your brain or the sac surrounding your heart (pericardium), you may initially be prescribed a\u00a0 corticosteroid  such as prednisolone for several weeks to take at the same time as your antibiotics. This will help to reduce any swelling in the affected areas. \n As with pulmonary TB, it's important to take your medicines exactly as prescribed and to finish the whole course. \n Latent TB \n Latent TB is when you have been infected with the TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms of active disease. Treatment for latent TB is usually recommended for anyone aged 65 or under. \n However, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause liver damage in older adults, so treatment for people with latent TB aged 35-65 isn\u2019t recommended if this is a concern. \n Latent TB is also not always treated if it's thought to be drug-resistant. If this is the case, you may be regularly monitored to check the infection does not become active. \n In some cases, testing and treatment for latent TB may be recommended for people who require treatment that will weaken their immune system, such as long-term corticosteroids,  chemotherapy  or TNF inhibitors. This is because there is a risk of the infection becoming active. \n Treatment for latent TB generally involves either taking a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for three months, or isoniazid on its own for six months. \n Side effects of treatment \n Isoniazid can cause nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy ), but you\u2019ll be given supplements of\u00a0vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) to take alongside it to reduce this risk. Your liver function may be tested before you start treatment. \n In rare cases, the antibiotics used to treat TB can cause eye damage, which can be serious. If you are going to be treated with ethambutol, your vision should also be tested at the beginning of the course of treatment. \n Contact your TB treatment team if you develop any worrying symptoms during treatment, such as: \n \n being sick\u00a0 \n yellowing of your skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice) \n an unexplained high temperature (fever) \n tingling or numbness in your hands or feet \n a rash or itchy skin \n changes to your vision, such as blurred vision \n \n Rifampicin can reduce the effectiveness of\u00a0some types of contraception, such as the  combined\u00a0contraceptive pill . Use an alternative method of contraception, such as  condoms , while taking rifampicin. \n Preventing the spread of infection \n If you are diagnosed with pulmonary TB,\u00a0you will be contagious up to about two to three weeks into your course of treatment. \n You will not normally need to be isolated during this time, but it's important to take some basic precautions to stop TB spreading to your family and friends. You should: \n \n stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it is safe to return\u00a0 \n always cover your mouth\u00a0\u2013\u00a0preferably with a disposable tissue\u00a0\u2013 when coughing, sneezing or laughing \n carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag\u00a0 \n open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time \n do not sleep in the same room as other people, as you could cough or sneeze in your sleep without realising it", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Several tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), depending on the type of TB suspected. \n Your GP may refer you to a TB specialist for testing and treatment if they think you have TB. \n Pulmonary TB \n A diagnosis of pulmonary TB (TB that affects the lungs) can be difficult and several tests are usually needed. \n This will include a chest\u00a0 X-ray  to look for changes in the appearance of your lungs that are suggestive of TB. Samples of phlegm will also often be taken and checked for the presence of TB bacteria. \n These tests are important in helping to\u00a0decide on\u00a0the most effective treatment for you. \n Extrapulmonary TB \n If you have suspected extrapulmonary TB (TB that occurs outside the lungs), several tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. These may include: \n \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan ,\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan , or\u00a0 ultrasound scan \u00a0of the affected part of the body \n examining the inside of your body with a\u00a0long, thin, flexible tube that contains a light and camera, which is inserted either through an opening such as your mouth (endoscopy) or a small cut made in your skin (laparoscopy) \n urine and  blood tests  \n a  biopsy  \u2013 a small sample of tissue or fluid is taken from the affected area and tested for TB bacteria \n \n You may also have a lumbar puncture. This involves taking a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the base of your spine. CSF is\u00a0fluid that surrounds the brain. It can be checked to see whether TB has infected your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). \n Screening for latent TB \n In some circumstances, you may need to be tested to check for latent TB (when you have been infected with TB bacteria, but do not have any symptoms). \n For example, you may need to be screened if you have been in close contact with someone known to have an active TB infection (an infection that causes symptoms), or if you have recently spent time in a country where TB levels are high. \n If you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common, you may be screened when you arrive or your GP may suggest screening when you register as a patient. \n Mantoux test \n The Mantoux test is a widely used test for latent TB. It involves injecting a substance called PPD tuberculin into the skin of your forearm. It's also called the tuberculin skin test (TST). \n If you have a latent TB infection, your skin will be sensitive to PPD tuberculin and a hard red bump will develop at the site of the injection, usually within 48 to 72 hours of having the test. If you have a very strong skin reaction, you may need a chest X-ray to confirm whether you have an active TB infection. \n If you do not have a latent infection, your skin will not react to the Mantoux test. However, as TB can take a long time to develop, you may need to be screened again at a later stage. \n If you have had the BCG vaccination, you may have a mild skin reaction to the Mantoux test. This does not necessarily mean you have latent TB. \n Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) \n The IGRA is a newer type of blood test for TB that is becoming more widely available. \n The IGRA may be used to help diagnose latent TB: \n \n if you have a positive Mantoux test \n if you previously had the BCG vaccination (as the Mantoux test may not be reliable in these cases) \n as part of your TB screening if you have just moved to the UK from a country where TB is common \n as part of a health check when you register with a GP \n if you are about to have treatment that will suppress your immune system \n if you are a healthcare worker"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Toothache", "introduction": "Toothache refers to pain in and around the teeth and jaws that's usually caused by tooth decay. \n You may feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold. \n The pain can also be mild or severe. It may feel \"sharp\" and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you're lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain. \n It can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it's coming from the ear. \n Toothache in other upper teeth may feel like it's coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead. \n The area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch. \n It's also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a \"dull\" pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth. \n When to see your dentist \n If you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get. \n If your toothache isn't treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. This can usually lead to a  dental abscess , with severe and continuous throbbing pain. \n Painkillers, such as\u00a0 paracetamol  and  ibuprofen , may reduce the pain and discomfort while you're waiting for an appointment.\u00a0Children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin. \n  Find a dentist near you . \n What causes toothache? \n Toothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of\u00a0sensitive nerves and blood vessels. \n Dental pulp can become inflamed as a result of: \n \n  tooth decay \u00a0\u2013\u00a0this leads to holes (cavities) forming in the hard surface of the tooth \n a cracked tooth \u2013\u00a0the crack\u00a0is often so small that it can't be seen with the naked eye \n loose or broken fillings \n receding gums \u2013\u00a0where the gums shrink\u00a0(contract) to expose softer, more sensitive parts of the tooth root \n periapical abscess\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a collection of pus at the end of the tooth caused by a bacterial infection \n \n There are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn't affected. These include: \n \n periodontal abscess\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a collection of pus in the gums caused by a bacterial infection \n ulcers on your gums \n sore or swollen gums around a tooth that's breaking through \u2013 for example, when your\u00a0wisdom teeth start to come through\u00a0 \n  sinusitis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0which sometimes causes pain around the upper jaw \n an injury to the joint that attaches the jaw to the skull (temporomandibular joint) \n \n Babies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as  teething . \n Treating toothache \n The type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an  X-ray \u00a0to try to identify the problem. \n If your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling. \n If your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place. \n If\u00a0the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection. \n Your tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can't be treated using these methods or\u00a0the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted). \n Preventing toothache \n The best way to\u00a0avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should: \n \n limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you should have these\u00a0as an occasional treat and only at mealtimes; read more about cutting down on sugar \n brush your teeth twice a day using a toothpaste that contains  fluoride \u00a0\u2013 gently brush your gums and tongue as well \n clean between your teeth using dental floss and, if necessary, use a mouthwash\u00a0 \n don't smoke\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it can make some dental problems worse \n \n Make sure you have regular  dental check-ups ,\u00a0preferably with the same dentist.\u00a0 \n The time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems. \n Your dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health. \n Children should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early. \n Read more about\u00a0 taking care of your teeth  and  keeping your teeth clean .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Tinnitus", "introduction": "Tinnitus is the term for hearing sounds that come from inside your body, rather than from an outside source. \n It's often described as \"ringing in the ears\", although several sounds can be heard, including: \n \n buzzing \n humming \n grinding \n hissing \n whistling \n \n Some people may hear sounds similar to music or singing,\u00a0and others hear noises that beat in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus). \n You may also notice that your hearing is not as good as it used to be or you're more sensitive to everyday sounds (hyperacusis). \n Is it serious? \n Tinnitus is rarely a sign of a serious underlying condition. For some people it may come and go and only be a\u00a0minor irritation. \n However,\u00a0it can sometimes be continuous and have a significant impact on everyday life. Severe cases\u00a0can\u00a0be very distressing,\u00a0affect concentration, and cause problems such as difficulty sleeping  (insomnia)  and  depression . \n In many cases, tinnitus will get better gradually over time. But it's important to seek medical advice to see if an underlying cause can be found and treated, and to help you find ways to cope with the problem. \n When to see your GP \n You should see your GP if you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears. \n They can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition\u00a0they could easily treat, such as an\u00a0 ear\u00a0infection  or\u00a0 earwax build-up . They can also do some simple checks to see if you have any  hearing loss . \n If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests and treatment. \n Read more about  diagnosing tinnitus . \n What causes tinnitus? \n Tinnitus\u00a0can develop gradually over time or occur suddenly. It's not clear exactly why it happens, but it often occurs along with\u00a0some degree of hearing loss. \n Tinnitus is often associated with: \n \n age-related hearing loss \n inner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises \n an\u00a0earwax build-up \n a middle ear\u00a0infection \n  M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \u00a0\u2013 a condition that also causes hearing loss and  vertigo \u00a0(a spinning sensation) \n otosclerosis\u00a0\u2013 an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss \n \n However,\u00a0around one in every three people with tinnitus doesn't have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing. \n Read more about the  causes of tinnitus . \n Who is affected? \n Most people have experienced short periods of tinnitus after\u00a0being exposed to loud noises, such as after a\u00a0music concert.\u00a0 \n In the UK, more persistent tinnitus is estimated to affect around\u00a0six million people (10% of the\u00a0population) to some degree, with about 600,000 (1%) experiencing it to a severity that\u00a0affects their quality of life. \n Tinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children, but is more common\u00a0in people aged over 65. \n Treating tinnitus \n There's currently no single treatment for tinnitus that works for everyone. However, research to find an effective treatment is continuing. \n If an\u00a0underlying cause of your tinnitus can be found, effectively treating\u00a0it may help improve your tinnitus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example,\u00a0removing a\u00a0build-up of earwax\u00a0might help. \n If a specific\u00a0cause can't be found, treatment will focus on helping you manage the condition on a daily basis. This may involve: \n \n sound therapy \u2013 listening to neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus \n counselling\u00a0\u2013\u00a0therapy that\u00a0aims to educate you about tinnitus and help you\u00a0learn to cope with it more effectively \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0\u2013 therapy that aims to help change the way you think about your tinnitus so it becomes less noticeable \n tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) \u2013\u00a0therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it \n \n Read more about  how tinnitus is treated .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "It's not clear exactly what causes tinnitus, but it's thought to be a problem with how the ear hears sounds and how the brain interprets them. \n Many cases are associated with\u00a0 hearing loss  caused by damage to the inner ear, although around one person in every three with the condition doesn't have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing. \n Inner ear\u00a0damage \n Sounds pass from the outer ear through to the inner ear, which contains the\u00a0cochlea and auditory nerve. The cochlea is a coiled, spiral tube containing a large number of sensitive hair cells. The auditory nerve transmits sound signals to the brain. \n If part of the cochlea is damaged, it will stop sending information to your brain. The\u00a0brain\u00a0may then actively \"seek out\" signals from parts of the cochlea that still work. These signals\u00a0might then\u00a0become over-represented in the brain, which\u00a0may cause the sounds of tinnitus. \n In older people, damage to the cochlea often occurs naturally with age. In younger people, it can be caused by\u00a0repeated exposure to excessive noise. \n Other causes \n As well as inner ear\u00a0damage, there are several other possible causes of tinnitus. These include: \n \n an  earwax build-up \u00a0that blocks\u00a0the ear \n a\u00a0 middle ear infection  \n glue ear\u00a0\u2013 a build-up of fluid in the middle ear \n a perforated eardrum \n  M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \u00a0\u2013 a condition that also causes hearing loss and  vertigo  (a spinning sensation) \n otosclerosis\u00a0\u2013 an inherited\u00a0condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss \n \n Rarer causes \n Less commonly, tinnitus may develop as a result of: \n \n a\u00a0 head injury  \n exposure to a sudden or very loud noise, such as an explosion or\u00a0gunfire \n  anaemia \u00a0\u2013 a reduced number of red blood cells that can sometimes cause the blood to thin and circulate so rapidly that it produces a sound \n reactions to certain medications, such as some  chemotherapy  medicines,  antibiotics , diuretics,\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u00a0and aspirin (this is more likely to occur at very high doses) \n acoustic neuroma\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a rare non-cancerous growth that affects the hearing nerve in the inner ear \n high blood pressure  (hypertension)  and\u00a0narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) \n an overactive thyroid gland  (hyperthyroidism)  or underactive thyroid gland  (hypothyroidism)  \n  diabetes  \n Paget's disease\u00a0\u2013 where the normal cycle of bone renewal and repair is disrupted", "treatment": "There's not usually a quick fix for tinnitus, but it will often improve gradually over time. A number of treatments are available to help you cope. \n If your tinnitus is caused by an underlying health condition, treating the condition will help stop or reduce the sounds you hear. \n For example, if your tinnitus is caused by an  earwax build-up , eardrops or ear irrigation may be used. Ear irrigation involves using a pressurised flow of water to remove the earwax. \n Read more about  how\u00a0an earwax build-up is treated . \n However, in many cases a cause for\u00a0tinnitus can't be found, so treatments will be used to help you manage the\u00a0problem on a\u00a0daily basis. These are described below. \n Correcting hearing loss \n Any degree of\u00a0 hearing loss  you have should be addressed because straining to listen can make tinnitus worse. \n Correcting even fairly minor hearing loss means the parts of the brain involved in hearing don't have to work as hard and therefore don't pay as much attention to the tinnitus. \n A\u00a0specialist will test your hearing and recommend appropriate treatment. This could\u00a0involve having a\u00a0 hearing aid  fitted, and occasionally\u00a0surgery. \n Improving your hearing will also mean sounds you wouldn't otherwise hear will now be audible, which\u00a0may help override the sounds of your tinnitus. \n Read more about  treating hearing loss . \n Sound therapy \n Tinnitus is often most noticeable in quiet environments. The aim of \"sound therapy\" or \"sound enrichment\" is to fill any silence with neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus. \n This may involve simple measures such as opening a window to hear noises coming from outside, leaving a radio or television on, or listening to\u00a0sounds\u00a0on a portable music player. \n You can get specially-designed sound generators\u00a0that look similar to a radio. These produce quiet natural sounds, such as\u00a0leaves rustling in the wind and waves lapping on\u00a0the shore. White noise generators are similar devices that produce a continuous \"shushing\" sound at a level that's comfortable and soothing. \n Also available are pillows containing built-in speakers to help distract you from tinnitus when you go to sleep, and small sound-generator devices that fit in your ear like a hearing aid. Some hearing aids have built-in sound generators for people with tinnitus. \n Counselling \n Understanding tinnitus\u00a0plays an\u00a0important part in learning how to cope with the condition and manage it\u00a0more effectively. \n Tinnitus counseling\u00a0is a type of therapy where you work with a healthcare professional to help you learn more about your tinnitus and find ways of coping with it. It's usually carried out by hearing therapists, audiologists (hearing disorder specialists) or doctors. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0is often used to treat mental health problems, such as anxiety\u00a0and  depression . It's based on the idea that your\u00a0thoughts affect the way you\u00a0behave. Treatment aims to retrain the way you think to change your behaviour. \n This technique can be effectively applied to tinnitus.\u00a0For example, if your knowledge about tinnitus is limited,\u00a0you may have certain ideas about it that make you feel anxious and depressed. This can make your tinnitus worse. \n Changing the way you think about your tinnitus and what you do about it can help reduce your anxiety and enable you\u00a0to accept\u00a0the noises, which after a while may become\u00a0less noticeable. \n Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) \n Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is a special type of therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it. The therapy involves a combination of more intensive sound therapy and long-term counselling. \n TRT is widely available privately and may be available on the NHS for people with very severe or persistent tinnitus. It should only be carried out by someone specially trained in the technique. \n Self-help \n Some people find\u00a0self-help techniques useful for managing their tinnitus. These techniques include: \n \n relaxation \u2013 stress can make your tinnitus worse,\u00a0so relaxation techniques\u00a0such as deep breathing and\u00a0 yoga  may help \n listening to music \u2013 calming music and sounds may help you relax and\u00a0fall asleep at bedtime \n sleep hygiene \u2013 if tinnitus is affecting your sleep,\u00a0sleep hygiene measures such as sticking to a\u00a0regular sleep pattern and avoiding caffeine or alcohol shortly before going to bed may help \n hobbies and activities \u2013 having a hobby or regularly participating in any activity you find enjoyable may help distract you from tinnitus \n support groups \u2013 sharing your experiences with others who have tinnitus may help you cope better \n \n  Action on Hearing Loss  has a  tinnitus forum  and provides further details about  support and activities in your local area .\u00a0Their free information line telephone number is\u00a00808 808 0123. \n You may also find the\u00a0 British Tinnitus Association \u00a0a useful source of information. You can call their confidential helpline free of charge on 0800 018 0527.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "You should see your GP if you have a problem with your hearing, such as hearing ringing or buzzing sounds. \n They will ask you some questions about your symptoms, such as: \n \n Does the sound\u00a0come and go, or\u00a0is it\u00a0continuous? \n Does the problem affect one or both ears? \n Is\u00a0the problem having an impact on your everyday life? \n Have you noticed any other\u00a0symptoms, such as hearing loss or  vertigo  (a spinning sensation)? \n \n They may also want to know whether you're taking any medication that could cause the condition, such as high doses of\u00a0 antibiotics \u00a0or aspirin. \n They will examine the outside and inside of your ear to check for obvious problems they may be able to treat, such as an  earwax build-up  or an  ear\u00a0infection . \n They might also carry out a simple test of your hearing and arrange  blood tests \u00a0to look for conditions sometimes associated with tinnitus, such as  anaemia  (a reduction in red blood cells),\u00a0 diabetes  or a problem with your thyroid gland. \n Seeing a specialist \n In some cases, your GP may refer you to a hearing specialist called an audiologist, who can carry out\u00a0a range of\u00a0hearing tests and\u00a0talk to you about the treatments available. \n Alternatively, you may be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your hospital. \n At your appointment, an ENT specialist will examine your ears, ask you about the type and severity of the noises you can hear, and carry out tests to try to establish what's causing them. \n Very occasionally, you may have a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan  or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Thrush in men", "introduction": "Thrush is a yeast infection caused by a fungus called Candida albicans. Both men and women can get thrush, though it is more often associated with women. \n The medical term for thrush is candidiasis. \n What it looks like \n In men, it usually affects the head of the penis \u2013 causing irritation, discharge and redness.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  symptoms of thrush  \n It can also affect the skin, known as candidal skin infection, and the inside of the mouth, known as  oral thrush . \n Should I see a doctor? \n If you suspect thrush for the first time, it's best to see a doctor for a diagnosis. This is because the symptoms can be similar to those of a\u00a0 sexually transmitted infection (STI) . Your GP will be able to tell the difference. \n If you've had thrush before and you recognise the symptoms, you can treat it yourself with over-the-counter medication. \n You should also visit your GP if you have a weakened immune system and you have thrush.\u00a0This is because there is a risk that a thrush infection could progress to a more serious case of invasive candidiasis. Read our page on the\u00a0 complications of thrush  for more information about invasive candidiasis. \n Treating and\u00a0preventing\u00a0thrush \n You can treat thrush without prescription medications. For thrush affecting your\u00a0penis, ask your\u00a0chemist for clotrimazole cream or a\u00a0tablet called fluconazole. For thrush infections in your groin or elsewhere, the chemist can supply a cream. \n It's possible for thrush to spread during sex, but it's not an STI.\u00a0However, both sexual partners may need thrush treatment to prevent re-infection. Re-infection from a female partner is common. Seek advice from a pharmacist or your GP. \n However, not all cases are caused by sex, and many cases develop in men and women who are not sexually active. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating thrush  \n You can help prevent thrush by\u00a0cleaning your penis regularly and using a condom while having sex with your partner (if they have thrush). \n Avoid using perfumed soaps or shower gels on your genitals, as they can cause irritation. Make sure you dry your penis properly after washing. \n Wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear can help prevent moisture building up under your foreskin, which lowers the chances of the candida fungus multiplying.\u00a0 \n What causes thrush? \n The fungus candida albicans occurs naturally in\u00a0your body, particularly in warm, moist areas, such as inside the mouth and around the genitals. \n It does not usually cause problems because it is kept under control by\u00a0your immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence against illness and infection) and other types of bacteria in the body. \n However,\u00a0certain conditions can cause the fungus to multiply and lead to infection. You are more likely to be at risk of thrush if: \n \n you have a weakened immune system \n are  obese , with large rolls of skin (an environment where fungi can often thrive) \n have\u00a0 type 1 diabetes  or  type 2 diabetes  \u2013\u00a0as the high levels of glucose associated with diabetes can encourage the fungus to breed; people with diabetes also tend to sweat more, creating a perfect breeding environment\u00a0for the fungus \n \n Read more about\u00a0 what causes thrush in men", "symptoms": "Some men may not experience any signs or symptoms of thrush. \n If symptoms do appear, they can include: \n \n irritation, burning or itching under the foreskin or on the tip of the penis \n redness, or red patches under the foreskin or on the tip of the penis \n a discharge under the foreskin that may look like cottage cheese \u2013 there may also be an unpleasant smell \n difficulty pulling back the foreskin of your penis (phimosis) \n \n Thrush as a skin infection \n Most candidal skin infections develop in areas of the body where folds of skin come together, such as the: \n \n armpits \n groin \n areas between your fingers \n skin between your genitals and anus \n \n People who are obese are also at risk of developing a skin infection\u00a0between their rolls of skin. \n The infection usually begins as a red and painful itchy rash. Small red spots can also develop on the rash. Affected skin may then scale over, producing a white-yellow curd-like substance. If the\u00a0skin between your fingers is affected, it becomes thick, soft and white.", "causes": "Thrush is caused by the Candida albicans fungus. \n Candida albicans \n Many people have a small amount of this fungus in their bodies. However, it does not usually cause problems because it is kept under control by the body\u2019s immune system and other harmless bacteria (so-called \"good bacteria\"). \n Thrush can develop when\u00a0the good bacteria in your body (which keeps candida under control) is destroyed. For example, if you are taking\u00a0 antibiotics  to treat an infection, the antibiotics will not distinguish between good and bad bacteria, and will fight off both types. \n Also, if you are run down and your immune system is weak, the candida fungus that causes thrush may multiply. \n Personal hygiene \n Candida tends to grow in warm and moist conditions. Therefore, you may develop thrush if you do not dry your penis carefully after washing. \n Using perfumed soaps and shower gels can irritate your penis, making thrush more likely to develop. Candida also thrives on skin that is already damaged. \n HIV, diabetes and other conditions \n Men who have  HIV ,\u00a0 diabetes  or other conditions that weaken the immune system are more at risk of developing thrush. This is because the infection develops quickly and the weakened immune system is not strong enough to fight it off. \n If you have uncontrolled diabetes (usually because you do not realise that you have the condition), you are more likely to develop thrush. Typical signs of diabetes include: \n \n excessive thirst \n frequently needing to pass urine \n weight loss \n \n See your GP if you have these symptoms, or if you have thrush that keeps recurring (coming back), even after treatment.", "treatment": "The recommended treatment for thrush in men depends on which area of the body is affected. \n For thrush that doesn't affect the penis, a type of anti-fungal cream called topical imidazole is usually recommended. \n Fluconazole is the first-choice treatment for thrush that affects the penis. It's also used as an alternative anti-fungal medication if your symptoms do not improve within 14 days of using a topical imidazole. \n Topical imidazole \n Topical imidazoles work by breaking down the membranes (walls) of the fungi cells. \n Examples of topical imidazoles include: \n \n clotrimazole \n econazole \n ketoconazole \n miconazole \n \n Most of these\u00a0are available from your pharmacist without\u00a0a prescription. Your pharmacist can advise which treatment is most suitable for you. \n The most common side effect of a topical imidazole is a mild burning sensation when you apply the cream. \n In a few people, some topical imidazoles have caused more severe burning\u00a0and a serious skin irritation. If this happens, stop using the cream and contact your GP for advice. \n If your skin feels itchy, your GP may prescribe a corticosteroid cream as an additional treatment. Corticosteroids reduce levels of inflammation within the affected tissue. This should help to resolve the symptoms of itchiness. \n Fluconazole \n Fluconazole is usually taken as a tablet and is often available over the counter without a prescription. \n Fluconazole works by destroying some of the enzymes (a type of protein that triggers useful chemical reactions inside the body) that fungi cells need to survive and reproduce. \n The most common side effects of fluconazole are: \n \n nausea \n abdominal (stomach) pain \n diarrhoea \n flatulence (excessive wind) \n \n Contact your GP for advice if\u00a0your symptoms do not improve after 14 days of taking fluconazole. You may need to be referred to a dermatologist for specialist treatment. A dermatologist is a doctor who specialises in treating skin conditions. \n Avoid having sex \n If you have thrush, avoid sex until the infection has cleared up, as your infection can be spread or made worse during sex. \n If you do have sex, use a condom to avoid infecting your partner. \n Some heterosexual men get a mild form of balanitis (inflammation of the head of the penis) after having sex. This is probably caused by an allergy to the candida fungus in your partner\u2019s vagina. However, it will usually clear up if your partner gets treatment. \n Gay men may also get thrush by having unprotected sex. The infection will usually clear up with treatment. Avoid sex until the infection has cleared up, and always use a condom. \n Good hygiene \n If you have thrush, practising good personal hygiene can help clear up the infection. Wash the affected area carefully using warm water. Showers\u00a0are a better option than baths. Avoid using perfumed soaps or shower gels on your genitals, because they can cause irritation. \n After washing, make sure\u00a0you dry the affected area carefully, as the candida fungus thrives in damp conditions. Wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear can help keep your skin and penis dry and cool, which helps prevent the candida fungus building up on your skin and under your foreskin.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Visit your GP if you have the symptoms of thrush (either on your penis or skin) and you do not have a history of the condition. \n If you have a previous history of thrush that has been diagnosed, you do not usually need another diagnosis unless it fails to respond to treatment (see recurring thrush, below). \n Thrush can be diagnosed at: \n \n your GP surgery \n your local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic \u2013  find a clinic  \n some contraception clinics and young people's services \n \n Thrush is diagnosed by a physical examination of\u00a0the head of your penis or the affected area of skin. \n It's important to get thrush diagnosed in case the symptoms are caused by a different condition, such as a\u00a0 sexually transmitted infection (STI)  or a bacterial skin infection. \n Further testing \n Further testing is usually only required if: \n \n your symptoms are severe \n your symptoms persist, despite treatment \n you have recurring episodes of thrush \n \n Testing usually involves using a swab (a small plastic rod with a cotton ball on one end) to obtain a small tissue sample from the affected body part. The tissue will be tested for the presence of any infectious agents, such as the Candida albicans fungus. \n You may also be referred for a series of blood and urine tests to check whether an underlying condition, such as diabetes, is making you more vulnerable to thrush. \n Recurring thrush \n If you have had thrush in the past and you recognise your symptoms, over-the-counter treatments from your pharmacist can help clear up the infection. \n If you keep getting thrush, or it does not clear up with treatment, visit your GP so they can investigate and recommend appropriate treatment. \n If you are a heterosexual man and\u00a0have thrush, it is likely that your partner may also have the condition. This is because the candida fungus often lives inside the vagina. It is therefore a good idea for both of you\u00a0to get treatment to prevent the infection being passed back and forth between you."},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Thyroid cancer", "introduction": "Thyroid cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a small gland at the base of the neck. \n The most common symptom of\u00a0cancer of the thyroid is a painless lump or swelling that develops in the neck. \n Other symptoms only tend to occur after\u00a0the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include: \n \n unexplained hoarseness that lasts for more than a few weeks \n a\u00a0 sore throat  or difficulty swallowing that doesn't get better\u00a0 \n a lump elsewhere\u00a0in your\u00a0neck \n \n It's important to remember that if you have a lump in your thyroid gland, it doesn't necessarily mean you have thyroid cancer.\u00a0About 1 in 20 thyroid lumps are cancerous.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  symptoms of thyroid cancer  \n The thyroid gland \n The thyroid gland consists of 2\u00a0lobes located on\u00a0either side of the windpipe. Its main purpose is to release hormones (chemicals that have powerful effects on many different functions of the body). \n The thyroid gland releases 3\u00a0separate hormones: \n \n triiodothyronine \u2013\u00a0known as T3 \n thyroxine \u2013\u00a0known as T4 \n calcitonin \n \n The T3 and T4 hormones help regulate the body's metabolic rate (the rate at which the various processes in the body work, such as how quickly calories are burnt). \n An excess of\u00a0T3 and T4 will make you feel overactive and you\u00a0may lose weight. If you don't have enough of these hormones, you'll feel sluggish and you\u00a0may gain weight. \n Calcitonin helps control blood calcium levels. Calcium is a mineral that performs a number of important functions, such as building strong bones. \n Calcitonin isn't essential for maintaining good health because your body also has other ways of controlling calcium. \n Types of thyroid cancer \n There are 4\u00a0main types of thyroid cancer. They are: \n \n papillary carcinoma \u2013 this is the most common type, accounting for about 6 out of 10\u00a0(60%) cases; it usually affects people under the age of 40, particularly women \n follicular carcinoma \u2013 accounts for around\u00a03 out of 20 (15%) cases of thyroid cancer and tends to affect older adults \n medullary thyroid carcinoma \u2013 accounts for between 5 and 8 out of every 100 diagnosed cases (5-8%); unlike the other types of thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma\u00a0can run in families\u00a0 \n anaplastic thyroid carcinoma \u2013 this is the rarest and most aggressive type of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 1\u00a0in 20 thyroid cancers; it usually affects older people over the age of 60\u00a0 \n \n Papillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they're often treated in the same way. \n How common is thyroid cancer? \n Thyroid cancer is a rare form of  cancer,  accounting for less than 1% of all cancer cases in the UK. Each year, around 2,700 people are diagnosed with thyroid cancer in the UK. \n It's most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over. \n Women are 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It's unclear why this is, but it may be\u00a0a result of\u00a0the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system. \n What causes thyroid cancer? \n In most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition. \n Risk factors for thyroid cancer include: \n \n having a benign (non-cancerous) thyroid condition \n having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer) \n having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis \n acromegaly\u00a0\u2013 a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone \n having a previous benign (non-cancerous) breast condition \n weight and height \n radiation exposure\u00a0 \n \n Read more about the  causes of thyroid cancer  \n Diagnosing thyroid cancer \n A\u00a0type of  blood test  known as a thyroid function test\u00a0will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems. \n If nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used. \n Further testing may be required if the FNAC results are inconclusive, or if more information is needed to make your treatment more effective. \n Read more about  how thyroid cancer is diagnosed . \n Treating thyroid cancer \n Your\u00a0recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether a complete cure is realistically achievable. \n Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs)\u00a0are treated using a combination of surgery to remove the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) and a type of\u00a0 radiotherapy  that destroys any remaining cancer cells and prevents the thyroid cancer returning. \n Medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than DTCs, so it may be necessary to remove any nearby lymph nodes, as well as your thyroid gland. \n Read more about  treating thyroid cancer  \n Recurrence \n Cancerous cells will return\u00a0in an estimated 5-20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. In approximately 10-15% of people the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones. \n Cancerous cells can sometimes\u00a0return many years after surgery and radioactive iodine treatment has been completed.\u00a0 \n You'll be asked to attend regular check-ups so any cancerous cells that return can be treated quickly.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  complications of thyroid cancer  \n Preventing thyroid cancer \n From the available evidence, eating a\u00a0 healthy, balanced diet  is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer. \n A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended that includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least\u00a0five portions a day) and whole grains. \n Outlook \n The outlook for differentiated thyroid cancers is very good. Most people (80-90%) will have a normal lifespan. \n Papillary and follicular carcinomas tend to be slow growing and relatively straightforward to treat. \n More than 9 out of 10 people with papillary carcinoma will live for 10 or more years after diagnosis. More than 8 out of 10 people with follicular thyroid cancer will live for at least 10 years after being diagnosed. \n Medullary thyroid carcinoma is harder to treat. It doesn't respond to iodine treatment, so removing all of the cancerous cells can be difficult. \n Survival rates for medullary thyroid carcinoma depend on the stage of the cancer when it was diagnosed. If diagnosed in its early stages, 97% of people live at least 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. \n If medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed after it has spread to other parts of the body, 1 in 4 people live at least 5\u00a0years after diagnosis. \n Because of\u00a0its aggressive nature, less than 1 in 10 people with\u00a0anaplastic thyroid carcinoma\u00a0will live at least 5\u00a0years after being diagnosed.", "symptoms": "In its early stages, thyroid cancer tends to cause no or very few symptoms. \n The main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck\u00a0just below your Adam's apple, which is usually painless. \n Women also have Adam's apples, but they're\u00a0much smaller and less prominent\u00a0than a man's. \n The lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. Lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection. \n Other symptoms of thyroid cancer only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include: \n \n unexplained hoarseness that doesn't get better after a few weeks \n a\u00a0 sore throat  or difficulty swallowing that doesn't get better \n pain in your neck \n \n When to seek medical advice \n You should always see your GP if you develop a swelling or lump\u00a0at the front of your neck. Although it's unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it's important that\u00a0it is\u00a0investigated. \n About 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. Most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called\u00a0goitres. \n Goitres \n A\u00a0goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. Non-cancerous goitres\u00a0are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as: \n \n too much triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones\u00a0\u2013 this is known as having an  overactive thyroid gland , or hyperthyroidism \n not enough T3 and T4 hormones\u00a0\u2013 this is known as having an  underactive thyroid gland , or hypothyroidism \n \n Thyroid cancer support \n The  Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust  provides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer. \n As well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on\u00a001207 545469, Monday to Friday, 10am to 4pm.", "causes": "In most cases, the exact cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. \n However, there are a certain things that can increase your chances of developing the condition, including having another thyroid condition and being exposed to\u00a0radiation. \n What is cancer? \n Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and\u00a0reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. \n Left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels and glands (lymph nodes) located throughout the body. \n Lymph nodes\u00a0produce many of the cells needed by your immune system (the body's natural defence system against infection and illness). \n Once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it's capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs. \n The most common types of thyroid cancer are papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas, which are known as differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs). \n They spread much more slowly than other types of cancer. When DTCs are diagnosed, they're usually limited to the thyroid gland itself or nearby lymph nodes. \n The rarer types of thyroid cancer are more aggressive and spread faster. By the time medullary thyroid carcinoma is diagnosed, it may have spread to the lymph nodes. In advanced cases, it may have also spread to the bones and lungs. \n Anaplastic thyroid cancer often spreads to the windpipe and, in some cases, the lungs. \n Risk factors for thyroid cancer \n The main risk factors for developing thyroid cancer are: \n \n having a thyroid condition \n having a family history of thyroid cancer (in the case of medullary thyroid cancer) \n having a bowel condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) \n acromegaly (a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone) \n having previous benign (non-cancerous) breast conditions \n weight and height \n radiation exposure \n \n These are discussed below. \n Thyroid conditions \n Your risk of developing\u00a0thyroid cancer is\u00a0slightly increased if you have certain non-cancerous (benign) thyroid conditions, such as an inflamed thyroid gland\u00a0(thyroiditis) or an\u00a0enlarged thyroid gland (goitre). \n Having an  overactive thyroid gland  (hyperthyroidism) or an  underactive thyroid gland  (hypothyroidism) doesn't increase your chances of developing thyroid cancer. \n Around 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0cases of\u00a0thyroid cancer occur in people who've had a previous benign thyroid condition. \n Family history \n Inherited genetic mutations are responsible for a small number of medullary thyroid carcinomas. If the instructions carried in genes are altered, some of the body's processes won't work normally. \n This inherited mutation occurs in: \n \n familial medullary thyroid cancer \n multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, types 2A and 2B \n \n In cases of MEN2A or MEN2B thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop during childhood or the teenage years. In familial medullary thyroid cancer, the mutations usually develop in adulthood. \n If one of your parents has a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN syndrome, you should consider having a  blood test  to find out whether you have the mutated genes. If your test results are positive, it's recommended you have surgery to remove your thyroid gland as a precaution. \n Familial adenomatous polyposis \n If you have a bowel condition called\u00a0familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), your risk of developing thyroid cancer is increased. FAP runs in families and is caused by inheriting a faulty gene. \n Macmillan Cancer Support have more information about\u00a0 familial adenomatous polyposis . \n Acromegaly \n Thyroid cancer risk is increased in people who have acromegaly.\u00a0This\u00a0is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone. \n Previous breast conditions \n If you've had\u00a0a benign (non-cancerous) breast condition in the past, such as a\u00a0breast cyst or fibroadenoma (non-cancerous tumour), your\u00a0risk of developing thyroid cancer\u00a0increases by around half (50%) compared\u00a0with women who haven't had this type of condition. \n Weight and height \n If you're overweight, you're more at risk of developing thyroid cancer than someone who isn't overweight. \n Research has\u00a0also shown that\u00a0taller adults\u00a0have\u00a0an increased risk. However, the reasons for this are unclear. \n Radiation exposure \n Exposure to radiation during childhood is another risk factor for thyroid cancer. \n Radiation from nuclear fallout and radiation used for medical treatments have both\u00a0been associated with thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Many recently reported cases of thyroid cancer are thought to have been caused by radiation exposure during medical procedures carried out between 1910 and 1960. \n During this time, not much was known about the risks of radiation treatment. Today there are much stricter regulations regarding the use of radiation for medical procedures. \n Other risk factors \n Diet \n If your diet contains low levels of the trace element iodine, you're at an\u00a0increased risk of developing thyroid cancer. \n People\u00a0exposed to radiation, or those with\u00a0a history of benign thyroid conditions,\u00a0are more likely to have low levels of iodine. \n Eating a lot of butter, cheese and meat may also increase your risk of developing thyroid cancer. To help reduce your risk, you should include plenty of fresh  fruit and vegetables  in your diet. \n People with a high\u00a0 body mass index (BMI)  also have an increased risk of developing thyroid cancer.\u00a0 \n Gender \n Women are about 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. \n It's thought this may be\u00a0because of the\u00a0hormones released during a woman's monthly period or during pregnancy. However, there's little scientific evidence to support this theory. \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  women's risk of thyroid cancer .", "treatment": "If you're diagnosed with thyroid cancer, you'll be assigned a care team, who will devise a treatment plan for you. \n Your recommended\u00a0treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether your care team thinks that a complete cure is realistically achievable. \n Cancer treatment team \n All NHS hospitals have multidisciplinary teams (MDTs)\u00a0that treat thyroid cancer. An MDT is made up of a number of different specialists, and may include: \n \n a surgeon \n an endocrinologist (a specialist in treating hormonal conditions) \n an oncologist (a cancer treatment specialist) \n a pathologist (a specialist in diseased tissue) \n a radiotherapist or clinical oncologist (a specialist in non-surgical methods of treating cancer, such as\u00a0chemotherapy and radiotherapy) \n a specialist cancer nurse, who will usually be your\u00a0first point of contact with the rest of the team \n \n Deciding on the best course of treatment can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations after reviewing your case, but the final decision will be yours. \n Before you go to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of\u00a0questions to ask\u00a0the specialist. For example, you may want to find out what the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments are. \n Your treatment plan \n Your recommended treatment will depend on a number of things, including: \n \n the type of thyroid cancer you have \n the grade of your cancer \n whether your care team thinks\u00a0a complete cure is realistically achievable \n \n Most differentiated thyroid cancers\u00a0\u2013 papillary carcinomas and follicular carcinomas\u00a0\u2013 and some medullary thyroid carcinomas have a good prospect of achieving a cure. \n Differentiated thyroid cancers\u00a0are treated using a combination of: \n \n surgery to remove your thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) \n a type of radiotherapy called\u00a0radioactive iodine treatment, which is\u00a0designed to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the thyroid cancer returning \n \n Medullary thyroid carcinomas tend to spread faster than differentiated thyroid cancers, so it may be necessary to remove\u00a0your thyroid gland and any nearby lymph nodes. \n Radiotherapy iodine treatment is not effective\u00a0at treating this type of thyroid cancer. \n Stage 4 medullary thyroid carcinomas aren't usually curable, but it should be possible to slow their progression and control any associated symptoms. \n In most cases of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a cure isn't usually achievable. This is because it's usually spread to other parts of the\u00a0body by the time it's been diagnosed. \n Radiotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0chemotherapy can be used to slow the progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma and help control any symptoms. \n Some cases of differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma may benefit from a new type of treatment known as targeted therapies. \n This is where medication is used to directly target the cancerous cells. However, these\u00a0types of treatments are currently undergoing\u00a0clinical trials and aren't offered routinely on the NHS. \n Thyroidectomy \n In almost all cases of thyroid cancer it's necessary to either remove some of your thyroid gland in a procedure called a hemithyroidectomy, or all of your thyroid gland\u00a0(total thyroidectomy). \n This decision\u00a0will be influenced by: \n \n the type of thyroid cancer you have \n the size of the tumour \n whether or not the cancer has spread beyond your thyroid gland \n \n Your surgeon should discuss with you the type of surgery required and why so\u00a0you can make an informed decision. \n A thyroidectomy\u00a0is carried out under a  general anaesthetic  and usually takes around 2\u00a0hours. The operation will leave a small scar on your neck, which\u00a0shouldn't be very noticeable. In a small number of cases, it may cause permanent hoarseness. \n Most people are well enough to leave hospital 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0days after having thyroid surgery. However, you'll need to rest at home for 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0weeks and avoid any activities that could put a strain on your neck, such as heavy lifting. \n A member of your care team will be able to advise you about when you'll be fit enough to resume normal activities and return to work. \n Replacement hormone therapy \n If some or all of your thyroid gland is removed, it will no longer be able to produce the hormones that regulate your metabolic system. \n This means you'll experience  symptoms of an underactive thyroid  (hypothyroidism), such as fatigue (extreme tiredness), weight gain and dry skin. \n To compensate, you'll need to take replacement hormone tablets for the rest of your life. \n If your surgery is to be followed by radioactive iodine treatment, it's likely you'll be given a hormone tablet called triiodothyronine. \n After radioactive iodine treatment is completed, you'll be prescribed an alternative hormone tablet called thyroxine, which most people only need to take once a day. \n You'll need to have regular  blood tests  to check you're receiving the right amount of hormones and to determine whether your dose needs to be adjusted. \n It may take some time to achieve the optimum dose. Until this time, you may experience symptoms of tiredness or weight gain if your hormone levels are too low. \n Alternatively, if your hormone levels are too high, you may experience symptoms such as weight loss, hyperactivity or diarrhoea. You shouldn't experience any more side effects once the\u00a0right dose has been achieved. \n Calcium levels \n Occasionally, the parathryoid glands can be affected during surgery. The parathryoid glands are located close to the thyroid gland and help regulate the levels of calcium in your blood. \n If your parathryoid glands are affected, your calcium levels may decrease, which can cause a tingling sensation in your hands, fingers, lips and around your nose. \n These symptoms should be reported to your MDT or GP as you may need to take calcium supplements. Most people only need to take a short course of calcium tablets\u00a0as the parathryoid glands will soon start to function normally again. \n Radioactive iodine treatment \n After having thyroid surgery, a course of radioactive iodine treatment may be recommended. This will\u00a0help destroy any remaining cancer cells in your body and prevent the cancer returning. \n If you're taking thyroid hormone replacement tablets, you'll need to stop taking them for\u00a0two to four\u00a0weeks before having radioactive iodine treatment. This is because they can interfere with the effectiveness of the iodine treatment. \n If withdrawing your hormone replacement treatment is problematic, you may be given a medicine called recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH). This is given as an injection on two consecutive days. \n Your MDT will be able to advise you about whether or not rhTSH is suitable for you. \n The procedure \n Radioactive iodine treatment involves swallowing radioactive iodine in either liquid or capsule form. The\u00a0radiation in the iodine travels up into your neck through your blood supply and destroys any cancerous cells. \n Side effects of radioactive iodine treatment are uncommon, but a small number of people may experience tightness, pain or swelling in their neck and may feel flushed (warm). These side effects usually pass within 24 hours. \n After treatment, you may have a\u00a0 dry mouth  and notice a change in your taste. These symptoms usually disappear after a few weeks or months, although they can be permanent in some people. \n You'll need to stay in hospital for\u00a03 to 5 days after the procedure because the iodine will make your body slightly radioactive. As a precaution, you'll need to stay in a single room protected by lead sheets so that hospital staff aren't exposed to radiation. \n You won't be able to have visitors during this time and hospital staff will keep their contact with you to a minimum. \n Your bodily fluids, such as urine, will also\u00a0be slightly radioactive for\u00a03 to 5 days after your treatment, so it's important that you flush the toilet every time you use it. Your sweat will\u00a0be radioactive, too, so you should\u00a0bathe or shower every day. \n You'll be allowed home after the radioactive levels in your body have subsided. \n Dietary recommendations \n While having radioactive iodine treatment, you'll need to eat a diet\u00a0low in iodine. An iodine-rich\u00a0diet may reduce the effectiveness of your treatment. It's recommended that you: \n \n avoid all seafood \n limit the amount of dairy products you eat \n don't take cough medicines or use sea salt\u00a0as they both contain iodine \n \n You should eat plenty of fresh meat, fresh  fruit and vegetables ,\u00a0and pasta and rice. These are\u00a0all low in iodine. \n Pregnancy and breastfeeding \n You shouldn't have radioactive iodine treatment if you're pregnant or if there's a good chance that you may be. The treatment could damage your baby. \n Tell a member of your care team if you're unsure whether you're pregnant. Any treatment will need to be delayed until after your pregnancy. \n You must stop breastfeeding before you can be treated with radioactive iodine. If possible, you should stop breastfeeding\u00a06 weeks prior to treatment. \n You should not resume breastfeeding after treatment for your current child, but you may safely breastfeed any babies you may have in the future. \n Breastfeeding also isn't recommended while receiving iodine treatment. If you're breastfeeding, you should stop at least 4 weeks (but preferably 8) before starting iodine treatment. \n You should also not\u00a0resume breastfeeding your baby. However, it's safe for you to breastfeed if you have another child in the future. \n You should\u00a0use a reliable method of  contraception  for at least 6 months after having iodine treatment. This is because there's a small risk that any child conceived during this time could develop birth defects. This applies to both men and women. \n Fertility \n Radioactive iodine treatment doesn't affect  fertility  in women. However,\u00a0there's a small risk that it could affect fertility in men who need to have multiple treatment sessions. Your\u00a0care team will be able to advise you about the level of risk in your individual circumstances. \n If there's a\u00a0significant risk you'll become infertile after having radioactive iodine treatment, you may wish to consider having your sperm or eggs harvested and frozen so they can be used for fertility treatment at a later date. \n External radiotherapy \n External  radiotherapy , where radioactive waves are targeted at affected parts of the body, is usually only used to treat advanced or anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. \n The length of time you'll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on the particular type of thyroid cancer you have and its progression. \n Side effects of radiotherapy include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n tiredness \n pain when swallowing \n dry mouth \n \n These side effects should pass 2 to 3 weeks after your course of radiotherapy has finished. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0is usually only used to treat anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that have spread to other parts of your body. \n It\u00a0involves taking powerful medicines that kill cancerous cells. It's rarely successful\u00a0in curing anaplastic cancer, but can slow its progression and help relieve symptoms. \n Possible side effects of chemotherapy include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n tiredness \n loss of appetite \n  hair loss \u00a0 \n  mouth ulcers \u00a0 \n \n If you're receiving chemotherapy, you'll also be more vulnerable to infection. See your GP if you suddenly feel ill or your temperature rises above 38C (100.4F). \n Targeted therapies \n A number of targeted therapies are being tested in\u00a0clinical trials to treat advanced cases of: \n \n medullary thyroid cancers \n differentiated thyroid cancers that don't respond to radioactive iodine \n anaplastic thyroid carcinomas \n \n In targeted therapies, medication specifically targets the biological functions that cancers need to grow and spread. \n As research is ongoing, some medications used in this type of treatment are unlicensed. In exceptional circumstances, your specialist may suggest using an unlicensed medication. They'll do this if: \n \n they think it's likely to be effective \n there are no better alternatives \n the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risks \n \n If your specialist is considering prescribing an unlicensed medication, they'll tell you that it's unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you. \n The decision about whether to fund treatment with medications used in targeted therapies is often made by individual\u00a0clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).\u00a0 \n The\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about  biological therapy for thyroid cancer .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "For many people, the first stage of diagnosing thyroid cancer is a consultation with a GP. \n Your GP will examine your neck and ask about any associated symptoms you may be experiencing, such as unexplained hoarseness. \n Thyroid function test \n A blood test known as a thyroid function test is used to check whether the swelling in your neck is caused by other problems with your thyroid gland. \n It will rule out conditions such as an  overactive thyroid gland  (hyperthyroidism) or an  underactive thyroid gland  (hypothyroidism), which are the most common thyroid problems. \n A thyroid function test measures the amount of certain types of hormones in your blood. \n Further tests will be needed if the thyroid function test reveals your thyroid gland is working normally. \n Fine-needle aspiration cytology \n Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)\u00a0is the next stage in diagnosing thyroid cancer. It's an outpatient procedure, which means you won't have to spend the night in hospital. \n A\u00a0small needle\u00a0is inserted into the lump in your neck to allow a tiny sample of cells to be removed. The sample\u00a0is then\u00a0studied under a microscope. \n This test\u00a0can usually reveal whether cancerous cells are present in your thyroid gland and, if they are, what type of thyroid cancer you have. \n Further testing \n Further testing may be recommended if the FNAC results are inconclusive or if further information is needed to make your treatment more effective. These tests may include: \n \n repeat FNAC combined with an  ultrasound scan  \n other types of scan, such as a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan  or\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \n \n In most cases, surgery will be recommended to remove the part of the thyroid gland that contains the lump or swelling\u00a0when it hasn't been possible to rule out thyroid cancer."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Tooth decay", "introduction": "Tooth decay can occur when acid is produced from plaque, which builds up on your teeth. \n If plaque is allowed to build up, it can lead to further problems, such as dental caries\u00a0(holes in the teeth),  gum disease  or  dental abscesses , which are collections of pus at the end of the teeth or in the gums. \n This\u00a0topic covers: \n  Symptoms \u00a0 \n  Seeing\u00a0a dentist \u00a0 \n  Treatment  \n  Cost of NHS treatment  \n  Prevention  \n  Protecting\u00a0your child's teeth  \n  How plaque causes tooth decay  \n Symptoms of tooth decay \n Tooth decay may not cause any pain. However, if you have dental caries you might have:\u00a0 \n \n  toothache \u00a0\u2013 either continuous pain keeping you awake or occasional sharp pain without an obvious cause \n tooth sensitivity\u00a0\u2013 you may feel tenderness or pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold or sweet \n grey, brown or black spots\u00a0appearing on your teeth \n bad breath \n an unpleasant taste in your mouth \n \n Seeing a dentist \n Visit your dentist regularly, so early tooth decay can be treated as soon as possible and the prevention of decay can begin.\u00a0Tooth decay is much easier and cheaper\u00a0to treat in its early stages.\u00a0Dentists can usually identify tooth decay and\u00a0further problems with a simple examination\u00a0or  X-ray . \n  Find your nearest dentist . \n It's\u00a0also important to have regular  dental check-ups . Adults should have a check-up at least once every two years and\u00a0children under the age of 18 should have a check-up at least once a year. \n Read more on\u00a0 getting over a fear of the dentist  \n Treatments for tooth decay \n Treatment\u00a0of tooth decay depends on how advanced it is. \n \n For early stage tooth decay \u2013 your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a  fluoride  gel, varnish or paste\u00a0to the area. Fluoride\u00a0helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay. \n Your dentist may discuss\u00a0a filling or crown with you \u2013 this involves removing the dental decay, offering\u00a0 local anaesthetic  to numb the tooth and filling the hole \n If tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) \u2013 this may be removed in a process known as\u00a0root canal treatment. \n If the tooth is so badly damaged that it can't be restored \u2013 it may need to be removed. Your dentist may\u00a0be able to\u00a0replace the tooth with a partial  denture , bridge or implant. \n \n Cost of NHS treatment \n NHS charges are set by the government and are standard for all NHS patients. Charges are assessed each year and usually change every April. \n Some people don't have to pay for dental treatment, including children, pregnant women\u00a0and new mothers.\u00a0Financial help may also be available to those on a low income. \n The cost of private dental treatment varies between practices, as there is no set charge. If you choose to see a private dentist, make sure to agree the cost before having treatment. \n Preventing tooth decay \n Although tooth decay is a\u00a0common problem, it's often entirely preventable. The best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. For example, you should: \n \n visit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums \n cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed \u2013 some medications can also contain sugar, so it's best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible \n look after your teeth and gums \u2013 brushing your teeth properly with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day, using floss and an interdental brush at least once a day \n avoid  smoking  or  drinking alcohol \u00a0excessively \u2013 tobacco can interfere with saliva production, which helps to keep your teeth clean,\u00a0and alcohol can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel \n see your dentist or GP\u00a0if you have a persistently  dry mouth \u00a0\u2013 this may be caused by certain medicines, treatment or medical conditions \n \n Read: \n  how to keep your teeth clean  \n  reading food labels \u00a0 \n Protecting your child's teeth \n Establishing good eating habits by limiting sugary snacks and drinks\u00a0can help your child avoid tooth decay. Regular visits to the dentist at an early age should also be encouraged. \n It's important to teach your child how to clean their teeth properly and regularly. Your dentist\u00a0can\u00a0show\u00a0you how to do this. Younger children should use a children's toothpaste, but make sure to read the label about how to use it.\u00a0 \n Children should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime. \n \u00a0 \n How plaque causes tooth decay \n Your mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque. \n When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates \u2013 particularly sugary foods and drinks \u2013 the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time. \n If the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities. \n Once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up. \n Without treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). At this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful. \n The bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone, causing another type of  abscess .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Tonsillitis", "introduction": "Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils. It's usually caused by a viral infection or, less commonly, a bacterial infection. \n Tonsillitis is a common condition in children, teenagers and young adults. \n The\u00a0 symptoms of tonsillitis \u00a0include: \n \n a  sore throat \u00a0and pain when\u00a0swallowing \n  earache  \n high temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F) \n  coughing  \n  headache  \n \n Symptoms usually pass within three to four days. \n When to see your GP \n Tonsillitis isn't usually a serious condition. You only need to see your GP if symptoms: \n \n last longer than four days and don't show any signs of improvement \n are severe \u2013 for example, if you're unable to eat or drink due to the pain, or you have difficulty breathing \n \n Your GP will examine your throat and ask you some questions about your symptoms. If necessary, a throat swab can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. The results usually take a few days to return. \n If your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, they may prescribe  antibiotics . Typical signs of a bacterial infection include white pus-filled spots on\u00a0the tonsils, no cough and swollen\u00a0or tender lymph glands. \n If you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a\u00a0 blood test \u00a0for  glandular fever.  \n The tonsils \n The tonsils are two small glands that sit on either side of the throat. In young children, they help to fight\u00a0germs and act as a barrier against infection. \n When the tonsils become infected, they isolate the infection and stop it spreading further into the body. \n As a child's\u00a0immune system develops and gets stronger, the tonsils become less important and usually shrink. In most people, the body is able to fight infection without the tonsils. \n Removal of the\u00a0tonsils\u00a0is usually only recommended if they're causing problems, such as severe or repeated episodes of tonsillitis (see below). \n What causes tonsillitis? \n Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as the viruses that cause the  common cold  or flu virus ( influenza ). \n Some cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria. \n These types of infections spread easily, so it's important to try to avoid passing the infection on to others by: \n \n staying away from public places, such as work, school or nursery, until your GP says it's safe to return (usually after the symptoms have passed) \n coughing and sneezing into a tissue and disposing of the tissue\u00a0 \n washing hands before eating, after going to the toilet and, if possible, after coughing and sneezing \n \n Read more about the  causes of tonsillitis . \n Treating tonsillitis \n There's no specific treatment for tonsillitis, but you may be able to reduce the symptoms by: \n \n taking  paracetamol \u00a0or\u00a0 ibuprofen  to help relieve pain \n drinking plenty of fluids \n getting plenty of rest \n \n If test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed. \n If oral antibiotics aren't effective at treating bacterial tonsillitis, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed in hospital. \n Chronic tonsillitis \n In most cases, tonsillitis gets better within a week. However, a small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is known as chronic tonsillitis and surgical treatment may be needed. \n Surgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended\u00a0if: \n \n you've had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time \n repeated episodes are disrupting normal activities \n \n Read more about  treating tonsillitis . \n Complications of tonsillitis \n Complications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it's caused by a bacterial infection. They're usually the result of the infection spreading to another part of the body. \n Possible complications of tonsillitis include: \n \n a  middle ear infection (otitis media) \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where fluid between the eardrum and inner ear becomes infected by bacteria \n quinsy (peritonsillar abscess)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an\u00a0abscess (collection of pus) that develops between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat \n  obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where the walls of the throat relax during sleep, which causes breathing difficulties and\u00a0poor sleep \n \n Other complications of tonsillitis are very rare and usually only occur if an underlying bacterial infection is left untreated. They include: \n \n  scarlet fever \u00a0\u2013 a condition that causes a distinctive pink-red skin rash \n rheumatic fever\u00a0\u2013 this causes widespread inflammation throughout the body, leading to symptoms such as joint pain, rashes and jerky body movements \n glomerulonephritis\u00a0\u2013 an infection (swelling) of the filters in the kidneys that can cause vomiting and a loss of appetite", "symptoms": "The main symptom of tonsillitis is a  sore throat . \n Your tonsils will be red and swollen, and your throat may be very painful, making swallowing difficult. \n In some cases, the tonsils are coated or have white, pus-filled spots on them. \n Other common symptoms of tonsillitis\u00a0include: \n \n high temperature (fever) over 38C (100.4F) \n  coughing  \n  headache  \n  earache  \n feeling sick \n feeling tired \n swollen, painful\u00a0lymph glands in your neck \n loss of voice or changes to your voice \n \n The symptoms of tonsillitis usually get better after three to four days. \n If\u00a0you have tonsillitis that's caused by\u00a0a viral infection, such as the  common cold  or  flu ,\u00a0your symptoms may be milder. \n If your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, such as a streptococcal infection, your symptoms will usually be more severe and you may also have bad breath. \n It's difficult to tell just by looking at a person's throat whether they have tonsillitis as a\u00a0result of a virus or a bacterial infection. Tests are needed to confirm this. \n  Antibiotics  may be recommended if test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection.", "causes": "Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection. \n Viruses known to cause tonsillitis include: \n \n rhinoviruses \u2013 which cause the  common cold  \n the  influenza  virus \n parainfluenza virus \u2013 which causes  laryngitis  and croup \n enteroviruses \u2013 which cause  hand, foot and mouth disease  \n adenovirus \u2013 which is a common cause of  diarrhoea  \n the rubeola virus \u2013 which causes  measles  \n \n In rare cases, tonsillitis can also be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes  glandular fever . \n If this is the case, you'll probably\u00a0feel very ill. You'll have a\u00a0 sore throat  and the lymph glands in your throat may be swollen. You may also have a fever and feel very tired. \n Bacterial tonsillitis \n Bacterial tonsillitis can\u00a0be caused by a number of different bacteria, but it's usually due to group A streptococcus bacteria. \n In the past, serious bacterial infections, such as diphtheria and rheumatic fever, have been linked with tonsillitis. However, this is now rare, because these conditions are vaccinated against and treatment for them has greatly improved. \n How tonsillitis is spread \n Tonsillitis itself isn't contagious, but the infections that cause it are. \n Viruses, such as those that cause colds and flu, are spread through coming into close contact with someone who's infected. \n When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of their nose and mouth. You can become infected by breathing in the contaminated droplets. This is known as direct contact. \n You can also become infected if you touch a surface or object that the droplets have landed on and then touch your face. This is known as indirect contact.", "treatment": "There's no specific treatment for tonsillitis and most cases get better within a week without treatment. \n While waiting for the infection to clear up, there are a number of things you can do to help relieve your symptoms (see below). \n If your child has tonsillitis, make sure they have plenty to eat and drink, even if they find it painful to swallow. Being hungry and dehydrated can make other symptoms, such as\u00a0 headaches  and tiredness, worse. \n Self-help \n Over-the-counter painkillers, such as  paracetamol  and  ibuprofen , can help relieve painful symptoms such as a  sore throat . \n If treating your children with painkillers, it's important to use the correct type and dosage. Younger children only need small dosages. Your pharmacist can advise you about this. \n Children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin. \n Over-the-counter treatments that can soothe a sore throat, such as lozenges and oral sprays, are also available. Some people find that gargling with a mild antiseptic solution can also relieve a sore throat. \n Alternatively, you could try gargling with warm, salty water. Mix half a teaspoon of salt (2.5g) with a quarter of a litre (eight ounces) of water. It's important not to swallow the water, so this method may not be suitable for younger children. \n Antibiotics \n  Antibiotics  may not be prescribed, even if tests confirm your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection. The two main reasons for this are: \n \n in most cases, antibiotics won't speed up the recovery, but they can cause unpleasant side effects, such as stomach pain and feeling sick \n the more an antibiotic is used to treat a non-serious infection, the greater the chance it won't be effective in treating more serious infections; this is known as antibiotic resistance \n \n However, exceptions are usually\u00a0made if: \n \n symptoms are severe \n symptoms show no sign of easing \n you or your child has\u00a0a weakened immune system \n \n In these circumstances, a 10-day course of penicillin is usually recommended. If you or your child is known to be allergic to penicillin, an alternative antibiotic, such as erythromycin, can be used. \n Hospital treatment may be required for particularly severe or persistent cases of bacterial tonsillitis that don't respond to oral antibiotics. In these cases, intravenous antibiotics (given directly into a vein) may be needed. \n Antibiotics sometimes cause mild side effects, such as an upset stomach,  diarrhoea  or a rash. \n Surgery \n Surgery to remove the tonsils is known as a tonsillectomy. \n For children with mild sore throats, watchful waiting is recommended rather than a tonsillectomy. \n A tonsillectomy is only considered for a recurrent sore throat if certain criteria are met. You must have: \n \n a sore throat caused by tonsillitis \n episodes of sore throat that are disabling and stop you functioning normally \n seven\u00a0or more well-documented, clinically significant, adequately treated sore throats in the preceding year or \n five or more such episodes in each of the preceding two years  or  \n three or more such episodes in each of the preceding three years \n \n Tonsillectomies are carried out\u00a0under  general anaesthetic , which means you'll be asleep during the procedure. Your mouth will be held open to allow the surgeon to see your tonsils and no cuts will be made in your skin. \n The operation can be carried out in a number of ways, as described below. \n \n Cold steel surgery \u2013 this is the most common method, where a surgical blade is used to cut the tonsils out. Bleeding is controlled by applying pressure or the blood vessels may be sealed using heat generated by diathermy. \n Diathermy \u2013 a diathermy probe is used to destroy the tissue around the tonsils and to remove the tonsils. At the same time, the heat seals the blood vessels to stop any bleeding. \n Coblation (or cold ablation) \u2013 this method works in a similar way to diathermy, but uses a lower temperature (60C). It's considered less painful than diathermy. \n Lasers \u2013\u00a0high-energy laser beams are used to cut away the tonsils and seal the underlying blood vessels shut. \n Ultrasound \u2013 high-energy ultrasound waves are used in a similar way to lasers. \n \n Each of these techniques is relatively similar in terms of safety, results and recovery, so the type of surgery used will depend on the expertise and training of the surgeon. \n You'll usually be able to leave hospital on the same day as you have surgery, or the day after. \n After surgery \n After surgery, it's likely you'll experience some pain at the site of the operation. This can last for up to a week. Painkillers can help to relieve the pain. \n Children who have had a tonsillectomy should be kept off school for two weeks. This is to reduce their risk of picking up an infection from another child that will make them feel more uncomfortable. \n Swallowing will probably be difficult after having a tonsillectomy. However, it's important to eat solid foods, because it will help your throat to heal more quickly. Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid acidic drinks, such as orange juice, because they'll sting. \n Ensuring good oral hygiene by regularly brushing your teeth and using mouthwash can help prevent infection in the mouth. \n The pain usually gets worse during the first week after having a tonsillectomy, before gradually improving during the second week.  Earache  is common with tonsillectomies, but isn't a cause for concern. \n Post-operative bleeding \n Bleeding at the site where the tonsils were removed is a fairly common complication of a tonsillectomy. This can occur during the first 24 hours following surgery or up to 10 days afterwards. \n It's estimated that around 1 in 100 children and 1 in 30 adults will experience post-operative bleeding after having a tonsillectomy. \n Minor bleeding isn't usually a cause for concern, because in most cases it resolves by itself. Gargling with cold water can often help stem the bleeding, because the cold helps to contract the blood vessels. \n Occasionally, the bleeding can be more severe, causing people to cough up blood. Seek immediate medical advice if this happens. You should be given an emergency contact number before you're discharged from hospital. Alternatively, you can call NHS 24's\u00a0'111' service. \n Extensive bleeding may need to be treated with surgery or a blood transfusion.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It can be\u00a0worse at night and disturb sleep. \n Read more about the  symptoms of threadworms . \n When to see your GP \n If you think you or your child may have threadworms, you can usually treat the infection yourself with medication available at pharmacies without a prescription. \n You only need to see your GP if you\u00a0think you have threadworms and you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you think your child has threadworms and they're under 2\u00a0years old. In these circumstances, the recommended\u00a0treatment is\u00a0usually different. \n How threadworms are spread \n Threadworms lay their eggs around an infected person's anus (bottom), usually at night. Along with the eggs, the worm also secretes a mucus that causes itching. \n If the eggs get stuck on the person's fingertips when they scratch, they can be transferred to their mouth or on to surfaces and clothes. If other people touch an infected surface, they can then\u00a0transfer the eggs to their mouth. \n Threadworm eggs can survive for up to 2\u00a0weeks before hatching. If the eggs hatch around the anus, the newborn worms can re-enter the bowel. Eggs that have been swallowed will hatch inside the intestine. After 2\u00a0weeks, the worms reach adult size and begin to reproduce, starting the cycle again. \n Read more about  what causes threadworms . \n Treating threadworms \n If you or your child has threadworms, everyone in your household will need to be treated\u00a0as there's a high\u00a0risk of the infection spreading. This includes those who don't have any symptoms of an infection. \n For most people, treatment will involve taking a single dose of a medication called\u00a0mebendazole to kill the worms. If necessary, another dose can be taken after 2\u00a0weeks. \n During treatment and for a few weeks afterwards, it's also important to follow strict hygiene measures to avoid spreading the threadworm eggs. This includes regularly vacuuming your house and thoroughly washing your bathroom and kitchen. \n If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, hygiene measures are usually recommended without medication. This is also\u00a0often the case for young children.\u00a0 \n Read more about  treating threadworm infections . \n Preventing threadworms \n It's not always possible to prevent a threadworm infection, but you can significantly reduce your risk\u00a0by always maintaining good hygiene and encouraging children to do the same. \n Children should wash their hands regularly, particularly after going to the toilet and before mealtimes. Kitchen and bathroom surfaces should be kept clean.\u00a0\u00a0 \n If your child is infected, encouraging them not to scratch the affected area around their anus or vagina will help prevent reinfection and reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.", "symptoms": "Threadworms often go unnoticed by people who have them. \n However, they can cause intense\u00a0 itching around the anus  (and the vagina in girls), particularly at night when the female worms are laying eggs. This can disturb sleep. \n In some cases, you may spot threadworms on your bed clothes or sheets at night, or you may notice them in your stools. The worms look like threads of white cotton and are about 1\u00a0centimetre long. \n Severe or persistent threadworm infections can cause: \n \n loss of appetite \n weight loss \n skin infection around the anus if bacteria enter\u00a0any scratches caused by itching \u2013 wearing cotton gloves while sleeping may help prevent this \n difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep\u00a0 (insomnia)  \n  bedwetting  \n \n In very rare cases, threadworms can spread outside the intestine\u00a0to\u00a0the urinary tract or\u00a0liver, or the vagina or womb in girls or women. \n Seeking medical help \n Speak to your pharmacist about treatment if you suspect you or your child may have threadworms. \n See your GP if: \n \n you think you have threadworms and you're pregnant or breastfeeding \n your child has threadworms and they're under 2\u00a0years old \n \n Read more about  treating a threadworm infection .", "causes": "A threadworm infection is passed from person to person by swallowing threadworm eggs. \n A female threadworm can lay thousands of tiny eggs around the anus or vagina.\u00a0The female threadworm also releases mucus, which\u00a0can cause an\u00a0 itchy bottom . \n Scratching the anus or vagina, or wiping them after going to the toilet, can cause the eggs to stick to your fingertips or under your fingernails. \n If you don't wash your hands, the eggs can be transferred to your mouth or on to food or objects, such as toys and kitchen utensils. If someone else touches a contaminated object, or eats contaminated food and then\u00a0touches their mouth, they'll become infected. \n After the eggs have been swallowed they pass into a person's intestine, where they hatch. After about 2 \u00a0weeks the threadworms will have grown into adults, at which point they'll reproduce and the cycle of infection will start again. \n Transferring eggs \n Threadworm eggs can be transferred from your anus (or vagina) to anything you touch, including: \n \n bed\u00a0sheets and\u00a0bed clothes \n flannels and towels \n children's toys \n kitchen utensils \n toothbrushes \n furniture \n kitchen or bathroom surfaces \n \n Threadworm eggs can survive on surfaces for up to two weeks. \n As well as being swallowed by a person who touches a contaminated object or surface, threadworm eggs can also be swallowed after being breathed in. This can happen if the eggs become airborne\u00a0\u2013 for example, after shaking a contaminated towel or bed sheet. \n Animals and pets \n Threadworms only infect humans and aren't spread in animal faeces. However, there's a small risk that threadworms can be caught from pets if the animal's fur becomes contaminated with eggs after an infected person strokes it. If another person then touches the animal's fur, the eggs could be passed on to them. \n Who's at risk? \n Threadworm infections most commonly affect young children because they often forget to wash their hands and they share toys with other children. \n People who are in close contact with someone with a threadworm infection also have a high risk of infection. This is why all members of a household\u00a0need to\u00a0be treated when someone has a threadworm infection. \n Read more about  treating threadworms .", "treatment": "To treat threadworms successfully, all household members must be treated, even if they don't have any symptoms. This is because the risk of the infection spreading is very high. \n The aim of treatment is to get rid of the threadworms and prevent reinfection. This will usually involve a combination of medication to kill the worms and strict hygiene measures to stop the spread of the eggs. \n The main medication used to treat threadworms is available from your local pharmacy without a prescription. However, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions\u00a0as it isn't suitable for everyone. \n You only need to see\u00a0your GP if you think: \n \n you have threadworms and you're pregnant or breastfeeding \n your child has threadworms and they're under two years old \n \n This is because the\u00a0recommended treatment in these circumstances usually isn't the same as that recommended for most other people. \n Medication \n Mebendazole\u00a0is the main medication used to treat threadworm infections. It can be bought over the counter from your local pharmacy or\u00a0prescribed by your GP. It's available as a chewable tablet or a liquid. \n Mebendazole works by preventing the threadworms absorbing sugar, which means they should die within a few days. \n This medication is 90-100% effective at killing the threadworms, but it doesn't kill the eggs. This is why the hygiene measures outlined below should also be followed for 6\u00a0weeks. \n Visit your GP if the infection continues two weeks after treatment. They may recommend a second dose of medication. \n In rare cases, mebendazole can cause abdominal pain or\u00a0 diarrhoea , particularly if the threadworm infection is severe. \n Hygiene measures \n Strict hygiene measures can help clear up a threadworm infection and reduce the likelihood of reinfection. \n The lifespan of threadworms is approximately 6\u00a0weeks, so it's important that hygiene measures are followed for at least this length of time. Everyone in the household must follow the advice outlined below. \n \n wash all night clothes, bed linen, towels and soft toys when you're first diagnosed \u2013 this can be done at normal temperatures, but make sure the washing is well rinsed \n thoroughly vacuum and dust the whole house, paying particular attention to the bedrooms \u2013 this should be repeated regularly \n carefully clean the bathroom and kitchen by damp-dusting surfaces and washing the cloth frequently in hot water \u2013 this should be repeated regularly \n avoid shaking any material that may be contaminated with eggs, such as clothing or bed sheets \u2013 this will prevent eggs being transferred to other surfaces \n don't eat food in the bedroom \u2013 you may end up swallowing eggs that have been shaken off the bedclothes \n keep your fingernails short \u2013\u00a0encourage other members of your household to do the same \n discourage nail-biting and sucking fingers \u2013\u00a0in particular, make sure children don't suck their thumb \n wash your hands frequently and scrub under your fingernails \u2013\u00a0it's particularly important to do this before eating, after going to the toilet, and before and after changing your baby's nappy \n wear close-fitting underwear at night and change your underwear every morning \n bathe or shower regularly \u2013 it's particularly important to bathe or shower first thing in the morning: make sure you clean around your anus and vagina to remove any eggs \n ensure everyone in your household has their own face flannel and towel \u2013 don't share towels \n keep toothbrushes in a closed cupboard and rinse them thoroughly before use \n \n Children can easily pick up another threadworm infection from friends or at school, so maintaining good hygiene may help prevent reinfection. \n Pregnant or breastfeeding women \n Medication isn't usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Instead, you should follow the hygiene measures above. \n See your GP if you're more than 3\u00a0months pregnant, or if you're breastfeeding and you continue to experience problems\u00a0after only taking hygiene measures. In certain circumstances, your GP may consider prescribing medication. \n Children under 2\u00a0years old \n Make sure you wash your baby's bottom gently but thoroughly every time you change their nappy. Also wash your hands thoroughly before and after changing their nappy. \n Mebendazole isn't licensed for use in children under 2\u00a0years of age, but GPs may decide to prescribe it\u00a0off-label for children over 6\u00a0months. \n If medication isn't used, the hygiene measures outlined above are recommended instead. \n Read more about  unlicensed medicines .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Thirst", "introduction": "Feeling thirsty all the time and for no good reason isn't normal and should be investigated by your GP. \n Thirst is normally just\u00a0the brain's way of warning that you're  dehydrated  because you're not drinking enough fluid. But\u00a0excessive and persistent thirst (known as\u00a0polydipsia) could be a sign of\u00a0an underlying problem such as  diabetes . \n Common causes of thirst \n Dehydration \n You will usually feel thirsty because you're not\u00a0drinking the amount of fluid your body needs. This may be because you've been sweating heavily or you've lost fluid because you have  diarrhoea \u00a0and are  vomiting . \n You can soon quench your thirst and restore the fluid balance in your body by having a drink and ensuring you remain well hydrated. \n It's\u00a0particularly important to stay well hydrated\u00a0during hot weather, while exercising and while you're unwell with vomiting and diarrhoea.\u00a0 \n Food \n In some cases, thirst may be caused by something as simple as a recent meal or snack. Eating\u00a0salty or spicy foods can cause you to suddenly feel thirsty. \n Diabetes \n If you feel thirsty all the time, it could be a sign of diabetes\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you also have other symptoms such as needing to urinate frequently, extreme tiredness (fatigue) and\u00a0unexplained weight loss. \n Diabetes is a lifelong condition that makes it difficult to control the level of sugar (glucose) in your blood. The high levels of glucose can mean your kidneys need to produce more urine to help pass the glucose out of your body. This can make you feel thirsty because your brain is telling you to drink more to make up for the fluids you've lost. \n If you feel thirsty all the time and have other symptoms, your GP will probably carry out a blood glucose test to see whether you have diabetes. \n Pregnancy \n Feeling thirsty, as well as urinating more often than usual, is a common symptom in pregnancy and usually nothing to worry about.\u00a0 \n Very occasionally, these problems can be a sign of gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy). You should be screened for this as part of your  antenatal care  if you're at risk. \n Medication \n Excessive thirst can\u00a0sometimes be a side effect of certain types of medication, including lithium, certain antipsychotics and diuretics (water tablets). \n If you think a particular medicine is causing your thirst, it may be possible to change to a different medicine or reduce your dose. Speak to your GP about this. \n Other causes of thirst \n There are also many other potential causes of severe thirst. These include: \n \n  diabetes insipidus  \u2013 a condition caused by problems with a hormone that regulates the amount of fluid in the body \n  diabetic ketoacidosis  \u2013 a dangerous complication of diabetes caused by a lack of the hormone insulin in the body \n sickle cell aneamia \u2013 an inherited blood disorder \n psychogenic polydipsia \u2013 where a person with a mental health condition, such as  schizophrenia , drinks excessive amounts of water that can't be excreted (got rid of) by the kidneys \n excessive bleeding", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

Some of the main causes are: \n \n varicoceles  \u2013\u00a0 swellings caused by swollen and enlarged veins within the\u00a0scrotum \n hydroceles  \u2013\u00a0 swellings caused by a build-up of fluid around the testicle\u00a0 \n epididymal cysts  \u2013\u00a0 lumps caused by a collection of fluid in the epididymis (a coiled tube behind the testicles) \n epididymo-orchitis \u2013 inflammation of the epididymis and testicles \n inguinal hernias \u2013\u00a0where fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin, which can cause the scrotum to become enlarged \n \n A sudden and severely painful swelling in one of your testicles can be a sign of a condition called testicular torsion, which is where the blood supply to a testicle is interrupted. \n In rare cases, testicular lumps can be a sign of  testicular cancer .  Cancer Research UK  estimates that fewer than four in every 100 testicular lumps are cancerous. \n Read more about the  causes of testicular lumps and swellings  \n Seeing your GP \n You should see your GP if you notice any lumps, swellings or changes in your testicles. \n Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your testicles to try to identify the cause of the problem. \n In some cases you may be referred for further tests, such as an  ultrasound scan  of your scrotum, to confirm a diagnosis. \n If you experience sudden or severe pain in your testicles, it's important to contact your GP immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department as soon as possible because urgent treatment may be required. \n Read more about  diagnosing testicular lumps and swellings  \n How testicular lumps and swellings are treated \n Treatment for testicular lumps and swellings will depend on the underlying cause. Many conditions do not need to be treated if they are not causing any many problems and they are not cancer. \n Some lumps and swellings will improve over time, and simple measures such as taking over-the-counter painkillers or wearing supportive underwear may be enough to relieve any pain or discomfort in the meantime. \n Surgery may be recommended to drain away any fluid or remove any solid lumps, if the problem gets worse. \n Testicular torsion will require urgent surgery to restore blood flow to the affected testicle because the testicle will start to die if not treated within a few hours of the problem developing. \n Read more about  treating testicular lumps and swellings", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Swollen glands", "introduction": "Swollen lymph glands are usually a sign of infection and tend to go down when you recover.\u00a0However, they can sometimes have a more serious cause and may need to be seen by a doctor.  \n Lymph glands (also called lymph nodes) are\u00a0pea-sized lumps of tissue that contain white blood cells. These help to fight bacteria, viruses and anything else that causes infection. They are an important part of the immune system and are found throughout\u00a0the body. \n The glands\u00a0can swell to more than a few centimetres in response to infection or disease. Swollen glands, known medically as lymphadenopathy,\u00a0may be felt under the chin or in the neck, armpits or\u00a0groin, where they can be found in larger clumps. \n Many different types of infection can cause swollen glands, such as a  cold \u00a0or  glandular fever . Less commonly, swollen glands may be caused by\u00a0a non-infectious condition, such as\u00a0 rheumatoid arthritis  or even cancer. \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you have swollen glands and: \n \n they haven't gone down within a few weeks or are getting bigger \n they\u00a0feel hard or don\u2019t move when you press them \n you also have a  sore throat \u00a0and find it difficult to swallow or breathe \n you also have unexplained weight loss,\u00a0 night sweats \u00a0or a persistent high temperature (fever) \n you don't have an obvious infection and don't feel unwell \n \n If necessary, your GP may request some tests to\u00a0help identify the cause. These can include\u00a0 blood tests , an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  or  computerised tomography (CT) scan , and/or a\u00a0 biopsy  (where a small sample of fluid is taken from the\u00a0swelling and tested). \n Common causes of swollen glands \n Swollen glands are usually caused by a relatively minor viral or bacterial infection, including: \n \n a\u00a0 cold  \n  tonsillitis  \n  glandular fever  \n a  throat infection  \n an  ear infection  \n a\u00a0 dental abscess  \n  cellulitis  (a skin infection) \n \n The glands in\u00a0the affected area\u00a0will often become suddenly tender or painful. You may also have additional symptoms, such as a sore throat,  cough ,\u00a0or fever. \n These\u00a0infections usually clear up on their own, and the swollen glands will soon go down. You will normally just need to drink plenty of fluids, rest and relieve the symptoms at home using over-the-counter medicines such as  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen . \n See your GP if your symptoms don't improve within\u00a0a few weeks. \n Less common causes of swollen glands \n Less often, swollen glands\u00a0may be the result of: \n \n rubella\u00a0\u2013 a viral infection that causes a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots \n  measles \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a highly infectious viral illness\u00a0that causes distinctive\u00a0red or brown spots on the skin\u00a0\u00a0 \n cytomegalovirus (CMV)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a common virus spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva and urine \n  tuberculosis (TB) \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a bacterial infection spread\u00a0that causes a persistent cough\u00a0 \n  syphilis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a bacterial infection\u00a0usually caught by having sex with someone who is infected \n cat scratch disease\u00a0\u2013 a bacterial infection caused by a scratch from an infected\u00a0cat \n  HIV \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a virus\u00a0that attacks the immune system and weakens your ability to fight infections \n  lupus  \u2013 where the immune system starts to attack the body's joints, skin, blood cells and organs \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \u2013 where the immune system starts to attack the tissue lining the joints \n sarcoidosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where small patches of red and swollen tissue, called granulomas, develop in the organs of the body \n \n Click on the links above for more information\u00a0on these conditions. \n Could it be cancer? \n Occasionally, swollen glands can be a sign of cancer that has started elsewhere in the body and spread to the lymph nodes, or a\u00a0type of cancer affecting the white blood cells, such as\u00a0 non-Hodgkin lymphoma  or  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia . \n Swollen glands are more likely to be caused by cancer if they: \n \n don't go away within a few weeks and slowly get bigger \n are painless and firm or hard when you touch them \n occur\u00a0with other symptoms, such as night sweats and weight loss \n \n See your GP if your glands have been swollen for more than\u00a0a couple of weeks.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Sunburn", "introduction": "Sunburn is skin damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays. It usually causes the skin to become red, sore, warm, tender and occasionally itchy for about a week. \n The skin will normally start to flake and peel after a few days and will usually fully heal within seven days. \n While sunburn is often short-lived and mild, it's important to\u00a0try\u00a0to avoid it, because it can increase your chances of developing serious health problems, such as skin cancer, in later life. \n It\u2019s easy to underestimate your exposure to the sun when outside, as the redness doesn\u2019t usually develop for several hours. Breezes and getting wet (such as going in and out of the sea) may cool your skin, so you don\u2019t realise you\u2019re getting burnt. \n You should always be aware of the risk of sunburn if you\u2019re outside in strong sun, and look out for your skin getting hot. \n What to do if you're sunburnt \n If you or your child has sunburn, you should get out of the sun as soon as possible \u2013 head indoors or into a shady area. \n You can usually treat mild sunburn at home, although there are some circumstances where you should seek medical advice (see below). \n The following advice may help to relieve your symptoms until your skin heals: \n \n Cool the skin by sponging it with cold water or by having a cold bath or shower \u2013 applying a cold compress such as a cold flannel to the affected area may also help. \n Drink plenty of fluids to cool you down and prevent\u00a0 dehydration . \n Apply a water-based emollient or petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) to keep your skin cool and moist. \n Take painkillers such as\u00a0 ibuprofen  or\u00a0 paracetamol \u00a0to relieve any pain \u2013 aspirin should not be given to children under 16. \n \n Try to avoid all sunlight, including through windows, by covering up the affected areas of skin until your skin has fully healed. \n When to seek medical advice \n You should contact your GP or the\u00a0NHS 24 111 service for advice if you feel unwell or have any concerns about your sunburn, particularly if you are burnt over a large area or have any of the more severe symptoms listed below. \n You should also see your GP if a young child or baby has sunburn, as their skin is particularly fragile. \n Signs of severe sunburn can include: \n \n blistering or swelling of the skin (oedema) \n chills \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above,\u00a0or 37.5C (99.5F) or above in children under five \n dizziness,\u00a0 headaches \u00a0and feeling sick (symptoms of heat exhaustion) \n \n Your GP may recommend using hydrocortisone cream for a few days (this is also available over the counter at pharmacies) to reduce the inflammation of your skin. \n Severe sunburn may require special burn cream and burn dressings from your GP or a nurse at your GP surgery. Very occasionally, hospital treatment may be needed. \n Who's at risk of sunburn? \n Everyone who is exposed to UV light is at risk of getting sunburn, although some people are more vulnerable than others. \n You should take extra care when out in the sun if you: \n \n have pale, white or light brown skin \n have freckles or red or fair hair \n tend to burn rather than tan \n have many moles \n have skin problems relating to a medical condition \n are only exposed to intense sun occasionally \u2013 for example, while on holiday \n are in a hot country where the sun is particularly intense \n have a family history of skin cancer \n \n People who spend a lot of time in the sun, whether it\u2019s for work or play, are at increased risk of skin cancer if they don\u2019t take the right precautions. \n Snow, sand, concrete and water can reflect the sun\u2019s rays onto your skin, and the sun is more intense at high altitudes.\u00a0 \n Dangers of UV rays \n The short-term risks of sun exposure are sunburn and sun  allergy . \n The longer-term risks (over decades) include: \n \n actinic (solar) keratoses\u00a0\u2013 rough and scaly pre-cancerous spots on the skin \n skin cancer \u2013 including both\u00a0 melanoma \u00a0and\u00a0 non-melanoma skin cancer  \n eye problems \u2013 such as photokeratitis (snow blindness) and\u00a0cataracts \n premature ageing of the skin and wrinkling \n \n Preventing sunburn \n Skin should be protected from strong sunlight by covering up with suitable clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen. \n In the UK, the risk of getting sunburnt is highest from March to October, particularly from 11am to 3pm, when the sun's rays are strongest. \n There is also a risk of getting sunburn in other weather conditions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, light reflecting off snow can also cause sunburn. You can also burn in cloudy and cool conditions. \n Suitable clothing: \n \n a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face, neck and ears \n a long-sleeved top \n trousers or long skirts in close-weave fabrics that do not allow sunlight through \n sunglasses with wraparound lenses or wide arms with the CE Mark and European Standard EN 1836:2005. \n \n Sunscreen: \n When buying sunscreen, make sure it's suitable for your skin\u00a0and blocks both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. \n The sunscreen label should have: \n \n the letters \"UVA\" in a circle logo and at least 4-star UVA protection \n at least SPF15 sunscreen to protect against UVB \n \n Most people do not apply enough sunscreen. The amount of sunscreen needed for the body of an average adult to achieve the stated sun protection factor (SPF) is around 35ml or 6 to 8 teaspoons of lotion.\u00a0 \n If sunscreen is applied too thinly, it provides less protection. If you\u2019re worried you might not be applying enough SPF15, you could use a stronger SPF30 sunscreen. \n If you plan to be out in the sun long enough to risk burning, sunscreen needs to be applied twice: \n \n 30 minutes before going out \n just before you go out \n \n Sunscreen should be applied to all exposed skin, including the face, neck and ears (and head if you have thinning or no hair), but a wide-brimmed hat is better. \n How long it takes for your skin to go red or burn varies from person to person. The Cancer Research UK website has a handy tool where you can\u00a0 find out your skin type , to see when you might be at risk of burning. \n Water-resistant sunscreen is needed if sweating or contact with water is likely. \n Sunscreen needs to be reapplied liberally, frequently and according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. This includes straight after you've been in water (even if it is \"water-resistant\") and after towel drying, sweating or when it may have rubbed off. \n Advice for babies and children \n Children aged under six months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight. \n From March to October in the UK, children should: \n \n cover up with suitable clothing \n spend time in the shade (particularly from 11am to 3pm) \n wear at least SPF15 sunscreen \n \n To ensure they get enough vitamin D, children aged under five are advised to take vitamin D supplements even if they do get out in the sun.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)", "introduction": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) \u2013 sometimes known as 'cot death' \u2013 is the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. \n In the UK, just under 300 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly every\u00a0year. This statistic may sound alarming, but SIDS is rare and the risk of your baby dying from it\u00a0is low. \n Most deaths happen\u00a0during the first six months of\u00a0a baby\u2019s life. Infants born prematurely or with a low birthweight are at greater\u00a0risk. SIDS also tends to be slightly more common in baby boys. \n SIDS\u00a0usually occurs when a baby\u00a0is asleep, although\u00a0it can occasionally happen while they're awake. \n Parents\u00a0can reduce the risk of SIDS by\u00a0not smoking while pregnant or after the baby is born, and always placing the baby on their back when they sleep (see below). \n  Find out how to stop smoking  \n What causes SIDS? \n The exact cause of SIDS is unknown, but it's thought to be down to a combination of factors. \n Experts believe SIDS occurs at a particular stage in a baby\u2019s development, and that it\u00a0affects babies who are vulnerable to certain environmental stresses. \n This vulnerability may be caused by being born prematurely or having a low birthweight, or because of other reasons not yet\u00a0identified.\u00a0 \n Environmental stresses could include\u00a0tobacco smoke, getting tangled in\u00a0bedding,\u00a0a minor illness or a breathing obstruction.\u00a0There's also an association between co-sleeping (sleeping with your baby on a bed, sofa or chair) and SIDS. \n Babies who die of SIDS are thought to have problems in the way they respond to these stresses and how they regulate their heart rate, breathing and\u00a0temperature. \n Although the cause of SIDS isn't fully understood, there are a number of things you can\u00a0do to reduce the risk. \n What can I do to help prevent SIDS? \n Below is a list of things you can do to help prevent SIDS. \n Do: \n \n Always place your baby on their back to sleep. \n Place your baby in the \"feet to foot\" position (with their feet touching the end of the cot, Moses basket,\u00a0or pram). \n Keep your baby\u2019s head uncovered. Their blanket should be tucked in no higher than their shoulders. \n Let your baby sleep in a cot or Moses basket in the same room as\u00a0you for the first six months. \n Use a mattress that's firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition. \n Breastfeed your baby (if you can).\u00a0 \n \n Don't: \n \n Smoke during pregnancy or let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby (both before and after birth). \n Sleep on a bed, sofa or armchair with your baby. \n Share a bed with your baby if you or your partner smoke or take drugs, or if you've been drinking alcohol. \n Let your baby get too hot or too cold. A room temperature of 16-20C, with light bedding or a lightweight baby sleeping bag, will provide a comfortable sleeping environment for your baby. \n \n Read more about  reducing the risk of SIDS  \n Seeking medical advice if your baby is unwell \n Babies often have minor illnesses, which you don't need to worry about. Give your baby plenty of fluids to drink and don't let them get too hot. \n If you're worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call\u00a0 NHS 24 111 \u00a0service for advice. \n Dial 999 for an ambulance if your baby: \n \n stops breathing or turns blue \n is struggling for breath \n is unconscious or seems unaware of what's going on \n won\u2019t wake up \n has a fit for the first time, even if they seem to recover \n \n Read more about\u00a0 spotting signs of serious illness in children  \n Support services \n If\u00a0a baby dies suddenly and unexpectedly, there will need to be an investigation into how and why they died. A  post-mortem  examination will usually be necessary, which can be very distressing for the family. \n The police and healthcare professionals work closely to investigate unexpected infant deaths and\u00a0ensure the family is supported. They should be able to\u00a0put you in touch with\u00a0local sources of help and support. \n Many people find talking to others who have had similar experiences helps them to cope with their bereavement. \n The\u00a0 Lullaby Trust \u00a0provides advice and support for bereaved families.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Stroke", "introduction": "A stroke is a serious, life-threatening medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to\u00a0part of the\u00a0brain is cut off. \n Strokes are a medical emergency and\u00a0urgent treatment is essential because the sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage is likely to happen. \n If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. \n Signs and symptoms \n The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time. \n \n Face\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the face may have dropped on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth or eye may have dropped. \n Arms\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the person with suspected stroke may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm. \n Speech\u00a0\u2013\u00a0their speech may be slurred or garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake. \n Time\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it is time to dial 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms. \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of a stroke  \n Why do strokes happen? \n Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death. \n There are two main causes of strokes: \n \n ischaemic\u2013\u00a0where the blood supply is stopped due to a\u00a0blood clot\u00a0(this accounts for\u00a085% of all cases) \n haemorrhagic\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts \n \n There is also a related condition known as a  transient ischaemic attack (TIA) , where the supply of blood to the brain is temporarily interrupted, causing a \"mini-stroke\" often lasting between 30 minutes and several hours. TIAs should be treated seriously as they are often a warning sign that you are at risk of having a full stroke in the near future. \n Read more about the  causes of strokes  \n Who is at risk? \n In the UK, strokes are a major health problem. Every year, around 110,000 people have a stroke in England and it is the third largest cause of death, after  heart disease  and  cancer .\u00a0The brain injuries caused by strokes are a major cause of adult disability in the UK. \n Older people are most at risk of having strokes, although they can happen at any age \u2013 including in children. \n If you are south Asian, African or Caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher. This is partly because of a predisposition (a natural tendency) to developing\u00a0 high blood pressure (hypertension) , which can lead to strokes. \n Smoking, being overweight, lack of exercise and a poor diet are also risk factors for stroke, as are  high cholesterol ,  atrial fibrillation  and  diabetes . \n How\u00a0strokes are treated \n Treatment depends on the type of stroke you have, including which part of the brain was affected and what caused it. \n Most often, strokes are treated with medication. This generally includes medicines to prevent and remove blood clots, reduce blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels. \n In some cases, surgery may be required to treat brain swelling and reduce the risk of further bleeding in cases of haemorrhagic strokes. \n Read more about  diagnosing strokes  and  treating strokes  \n Life after a stroke \n Around one in every four people who has a stroke will die, and those who do survive are often left with long-term problems resulting from the injury to their brain. \n Some people need to have a long period of rehabilitation before they can recover their former independence, while many will never fully recover and will need support adjusting to living with the effects of their stroke. \n Local authorities should provide free \"reablement services\" for anyone assessed as needing them. These services help the person recovering from a stroke to learn or relearn the skills necessary for independent daily living at home.\u00a0 \n Around half the people who have a stroke will be dependent on some form of care for help with their daily activities. \n For example,\u00a0a care worker could\u00a0come to the person's home to help with washing and dressing, or even just to provide\u00a0companionship. Read more about  care services in your home \u00a0on Care Information Scotland. \n A team of specialists are also available to help, including physiotherapists, psychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and specialist nurses and doctors. \n Read more about  recovering from a stroke  \n Can strokes be prevented? \n You can significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke through a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a  healthy diet , taking regular  exercise , drinking alcohol in moderation and\u00a0 not smoking . \n Lowering high blood pressure and cholesterol levels with medication also lowers the risk of stroke substantially, as does taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to a condition called atrial fibrillation. \n If you have had a stroke or TIA in the past, these measures are particularly important because your risk of having another stroke in the future is greatly increased. \n Read more about\u00a0 preventing strokes", "symptoms": "", "causes": "There are two main types of stroke \u2013 ischaemic strokes and haemorrhagic strokes \u2013 which affect the brain in different ways and can have different causes.\u00a0 \n Ischaemic strokes \n Ischaemic strokes are the most common type of stroke. They occur when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain. \n These blood clots typically form in areas where the arteries have been narrowed or blocked over time by fatty deposits known as plaques. This process is known as atherosclerosis. \n As you get older, the arteries can naturally narrow, but certain things can dangerously accelerate the process. These include: \n \n smoking\u00a0 \n  high blood pressure  (hypertension)\u00a0 \n  obesity \u00a0 \n  high cholesterol levels  \n  diabetes \u00a0 \n an excessive alcohol intake \n \n Another possible cause of ischaemic stroke is a type of irregular heartbeat called  atrial fibrillation , which can cause blood clots in the heart that break up and escape from the heart and become lodged in the blood vessels supplying the brain. \n Atrial fibrillation can have a number of different causes, including lung disease, heart valve disease, excessive alcohol intake,  coronary heart disease , and an\u00a0 overactive thyroid gland \u00a0 (hyperthyroidism). Read more about the  causes of atrial fibrillation . \n Haemorrhagic strokes \n Haemorrhagic strokes (also known as cerebral haemorrhages or intracranial haemorrhages) are less common than ischaemic strokes. They occur when a blood vessel within the skull bursts and bleeds into and around the brain. \n The main cause of haemorrhagic stroke is high blood pressure, which can weaken the arteries in the brain and make them prone to split or rupture. \n Things that increase the risk of high blood pressure include: \n \n being overweight\u00a0or obese \n drinking excessive amounts of alcohol\u00a0 \n smoking \n a lack of exercise\u00a0 \n stress, which may cause a temporary rise in blood pressure \n \n Haemorrhagic strokes can also occur as the result of the rupture of a balloon-like expansion of a blood vessel (brain aneurysm) and badly-formed blood vessels in the brain. \n Can I reduce my risk? \n It's not possible to completely prevent strokes because some things that increase\u00a0your risk of the condition cannot be changed, including: \n \n age \u2013 you are more likely to have a stroke if you are over 65 years old, although about a quarter of strokes happen in younger people \n family history \u2013 if a close relative (parent, grandparent, brother or sister) has had a stroke, your risk is likely to be higher \n ethnicity \u2013 if you are south Asian, African or Caribbean, your risk of stroke is higher, partly because rates of diabetes and high blood pressure are higher in these groups \n your medical history \u2013 if you have previously had a stroke,  transient ischaemic attack (TIA)  or  heart attack , your risk of stroke is higher \n \n However, in most cases it is possible to significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke by making lifestyle changes to avoid problems such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. This includes things such as having a healthy diet, exercising regularly, stopping smoking if you smoke and cutting down on the amount of alcohol you drink. \n As atrial fibrillation can also significantly increase your risk of having a stroke, it is also important to seek medical advice if you think you may have an irregular heartbeat. If you are diagnosed with the condition, you should talk to your doctor about the option of taking anticoagulant medications to lower your stroke risk. \n Read more about  preventing strokes", "treatment": "Treating ischaemic strokes \n If you have had an ischaemic stroke, a combination of medications to treat the condition and prevent it from happening again will usually be recommended. \n Some of these medications will need to be taken immediately and only for a short time, while others may only be started once the stroke has been treated and may need to be taken in the long-term. \n Thrombolysis \n Ischaemic strokes can often be treated using injections of a medication called\u00a0alteplase that dissolves blood clots and restores the flow of blood to the brain. This use of \"clot-busting\" medication is known as thrombolysis. \n Alteplase is\u00a0most effective if started as soon as possible after the stroke occurs and is not generally recommended if more than four-and-a-half hours have passed, because it's not clear how beneficial it is\u00a0when used after this time. \n However, before alteplase can be used, it is very important that a brain scan to confirm a diagnosis of an ischaemic stroke is carried out because the medication can make\u00a0the bleeding that occurs in\u00a0haemorrhagic strokes worse. \n Antiplatelets \n Most people will also be offered a regular dose of\u00a0 aspirin  which \u2013 as well as being a painkiller \u2013 makes the cells in your blood called platelets less sticky, reducing the chances of another clot forming. \n In addition\u00a0to aspirin, other antiplatelet medicines such as  clopidogrel  and dipyridamole are also available. \n Anticoagulants \n Some people may also be offered an additional medication called an anticoagulant to help reduce their risk of developing further blood clots in the future. \n Anticoagulants prevent blood clots by changing the chemical composition of the blood in a way that prevents clots from occurring.  Warfarin , rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban are examples of anticoagulants for long term use. There are also a number of anticoagulants called heparins that can only be given by injection and are used in the short term.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Anticoagulants may be offered if you: \n \n have a type of irregular heartbeat called  atrial fibrillation  that can cause blood clots \n have\u00a0a history of blood clots \n are at risk of developing clots in your leg veins \u2013 known as  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  \u2013 because a stroke has left you unable to move one of your legs \n \n Antihypertensives \n If your blood pressure is too high, you may be offered medicines to lower it. Medicines that are commonly used include: \n \n thiazide diuretics \n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n calcium channel blockers \n beta-blockers \n alpha-blockers \n \n Read more about  treating high blood pressure  \n Statins \n If the level of cholesterol in your blood is too high, you will be advised to take a medicine known as a  statin . Statins reduce the level of cholesterol in your blood by blocking an enzyme (chemical) in the liver that produces cholesterol. \n You may be offered a statin, even if your cholesterol level is not particularly high, because a statin may help reduce your risk of stroke whatever your cholesterol level is. \n Carotid endarterectomy \n Some ischaemic strokes are caused by narrowing of an artery in the neck called the carotid artery, which carries blood to the brain. The narrowing, known as carotid stenosis, is caused by a build-up of fatty plaques. \n If the carotid stenosis is particularly severe, surgery may be offered to unblock the artery. This is done using a surgical technique called a carotid endarterectomy. It involves the surgeon making an incision in your neck to open up the carotid artery and remove the fatty deposits. \n Treating haemorrhagic strokes \n As with ischaemic strokes, some people who have had a haemorrhagic stroke will also be offered medication, such as ACE inhibitors, to lower blood pressure and prevent further strokes from occurring. \n If you were previously taking anticoagulant medicine before you had your stroke, you may also need treatment to reverse the effects of the medication and reduce your risk of further bleeding. \n Surgery \n Occasionally, emergency surgery may\u00a0be needed to remove any blood from the brain and repair any burst blood vessels. This is usually done using a surgical procedure known as a craniotomy. \n During a craniotomy, a section of the skull is cut away to allow the surgeon access to the cause of the bleeding. The surgeon will repair any damaged blood vessels and ensure there are no blood clots present that may restrict the blood flow to the brain. \n After the bleeding has been stopped, the piece of bone removed from the skull is replaced, often by an artificial metal plate. \n Surgery for hydrocephalus \n Surgery can also be carried out to treat\u00a0a complication of haemorrhagic strokes called hydrocephalus. \n This is where damage\u00a0resulting from\u00a0a stroke causes cerebrospinal fluid to build up in the cavities (ventricles) of the brain, causing symptoms such as  headaches , sickness, vomiting and loss of balance. \n Hydrocephalus can be treated\u00a0by surgically placing an artificial\u00a0tube called a shunt\u00a0into the brain to allow the fluid to drain properly. \n Read more about  treating hydrocephalus  \n Supportive treatments \n In addition to the treatments mentioned above, you may also need further short-term treatment to help manage some of the problems that\u00a0can affect people who have had a stroke. \n For example, you may require: \n \n a feeding tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube) to provide nutrition if you have  difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)  \n nutritional supplements if you are malnourished \n fluids given directly into a vein (intravenously) if you are at risk of  dehydration  \n oxygen through a nasal tube or face mask if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood \n \n For more information about the supportive treatments you may need in the long-term to help you manage the lasting effect of a stroke, see  recovering from a stroke . \n What is good stroke care? \n The National Stroke Strategy, published in December 2007, provides a guide to high-quality health and social care for those affected by stroke. Stroke experts have set out standards which define good stroke care, including: \n \n a rapid response to a 999 call for suspected stroke \n prompt transfer to a hospital providing specialist care \n an urgent brain scan \u2013 for example,  computerised tomography (CT) scan  or  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  undertaken as soon as possible \n immediate access to a high-quality stroke unit \n early multidisciplinary assessment, including swallowing screening \n stroke specialised rehabilitation \n planned transfer of care from hospital to community and longer-term support \n \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has also produced  guidelines on the diagnosis and management of stroke . \n If you are concerned about the standard of care provided, speak to your stroke specialist or a member of the stroke team.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Strokes are usually diagnosed by carrying out physical tests and studying images of the brain produced during a scan. \n When you first arrive at hospital with a suspected stroke, a doctor will usually want to find out as much as they can about your symptoms. \n A number of tests can then be carried out to help confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause of the stroke. \n This may include\u00a0 blood tests  to determine your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, checking your pulse for an irregular heartbeat and taking a blood pressure measurement. \n Brain scans \n Even if the physical symptoms of a stroke are obvious, brain\u00a0scans should also be carried out to determine: \n \n if the stroke has been caused by a blocked artery (ischaemic stroke) or burst blood vessel (haemorrhagic stroke) \n which part of the brain has been affected \n how severe the stroke is \n \n Different treatment is required for the different types of stroke, so a rapid diagnosis will make treatment more straightforward. \n Everyone with suspected stroke should receive a brain scan within 24 hours and some people should be scanned within an hour of the onset of symptoms, especially those who: \n \n might benefit from clot-busting drugs (thrombolysis) such as alteplase or early anticoagulant treatment \n are already on anticoagulant treatments \n have a lower level of consciousness \n \n This is why a stroke is a medical emergency and why 999 should be dialled when a stroke is suspected \u2013 there isn\u2019t time to wait for a GP appointment. \n The two main\u00a0types of scan used to assess the brain in people who have had a suspected stroke are a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  and a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . The type of scan you may have largely depends on your symptoms. \n CT scans \n A CT scan is like an  X-ray , but uses multiple images to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional picture of your brain to help your doctor identify any problem areas. \n During the scan, you may be given an injection of a special dye into one of the veins in your arm to help improve the clarity of the CT image and look at the blood vessels that supply the brain. \n If it is suspected you are experiencing a major stroke, a CT scan is usually able to show whether you have had an ischaemic stroke or a haemorrhagic stroke. It's generally quicker than an MRI scan and can mean you are able to receive appropriate treatment sooner. \n MRI scans \n An MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a detailed picture of the inside of your body. \n For people with more complex symptoms, where the extent or location of the damage is unknown \u2013 and in people who have recovered from a  transient ischaemic attack (TIA)  \u2013 an MRI scan is more appropriate. This will provide greater detail of brain tissue, allowing smaller, or more unusually located areas affected by a stroke to be identified. \n As with a CT scan, special dye can be used to improve MRI scan images. \n Swallow tests \n A swallow test is essential for anybody who has had a stroke, as swallowing ability is commonly affected early after a stroke. \n When a person cannot swallow properly, there is a risk that food and drink may get into the windpipe and then into the lungs (called aspiration), which can lead to  chest infections  such as  pneumonia . \n The test is simple. The person is given a few teaspoons of water to drink. If they can swallow this without choking and coughing they will be asked to swallow half a glass of water. \n If they have any difficulty swallowing, they will be referred to the speech and language therapist for a more detailed assessment. \n They will usually not be allowed to eat or drink normally until they have seen the therapist and may therefore need to have fluids or food given directly into an arm vein (intravenously) or through a tube inserted into their stomach via their nose. \n Heart and blood vessel tests\u00a0 \n Further tests on the heart and blood vessels might be carried out later to confirm what caused your\u00a0stroke. Some of the tests that may be carried out are described below. \n Carotid ultrasound \n A carotid\u00a0 ultrasound scan  can help show if there is any narrowing or blockages in the neck arteries leading to your brain. \n An ultrasound scan involves using a small probe (transducer) to send high-frequency sound waves into your body. When these sound waves bounce back, they can be used to create an image of the inside of your body. \n When carotid ultrasonography is needed, it should happen within 48 hours. \n Echocardiography \n In some cases another type of ultrasound scan called an\u00a0 echocardiogram  may be carried out to produce images of your heart and check for any problem with it that could be related to your stroke. \n This will normally involve using an ultrasound probe moved across your chest (transthoracic echocardiogram). \n In\u00a0some cases, an alternative type of echocardiogram called transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) may also be used. \n This involves passing an ultrasound probe down your gullet (oesophagus), usually under sedation. As this allows the probe to be placed directly behind the heart, it produces a clear image of blood clots and other abnormalities that may not get picked up by a transthoracic echocardiogram."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Stomach ulcer", "introduction": "Stomach ulcers, also known as gastric ulcers, are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. \n Ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach\u00a0\u2013 these\u00a0are known as duodenal ulcers. \n Both stomach and duodenal ulcers are sometimes referred to as peptic ulcers. Here the term \u201cstomach ulcer\u201d will be used, although the information applies equally to duodenal ulcers. \n Signs and symptoms \n The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). \n However,\u00a0stomach\u00a0ulcers aren't always painful and some people may experience other symptoms, such as\u00a0indigestion,\u00a0 heartburn  and feeling sick. \n Read more about the  symptoms of a stomach ulcer \u00a0and  diagnosing a stomach ulcer . \n When to seek medical advice \n You should visit your GP if you think you may have a stomach ulcer. \n Seek urgent medical advice if you experience any of the following symptoms: \n \n vomiting blood\u00a0\u2013 the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance, similar to coffee grounds \n passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools \n a sudden, sharp pain in your\u00a0tummy that gets steadily worse \n \n These could be a sign of a serious complication, such as internal bleeding (see below). \n What causes stomach ulcers? \n Stomach ulcers occur when the layer that protects the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down, which\u00a0allows the stomach lining\u00a0to become damaged. \n This is usually a result of : \n \n an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria \n taking  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen  or\u00a0 aspirin \u00a0\u2013 particularly if they're taken for a long time or at high doses \n \n It used to be thought that stress or certain foods might cause stomach ulcers, but there's little evidence to suggest this is the case. \n Read more about the  causes of stomach ulcers . \n Who is affected \n It's not known how many people have stomach ulcers, although they're thought to be quite common. Some studies have\u00a0found that around 1 in 10 people\u00a0may get a\u00a0stomach ulcer at some point in their life. \n Stomach ulcers can affect people of any age, including children, but mostly occur in people aged 60 or over.\u00a0Men are more commonly affected than women. \n How\u00a0stomach ulcers are treated \n With treatment, most stomach ulcers will heal within a month or two. The treatment recommended for you will depend on what caused the ulcer. \n Most people will be prescribed a medication called a proton pump inhibitor\u00a0(PPI) to reduce the amount of acid their stomach produces, and\u00a0allow the ulcer to heal naturally. \n If an H. pylori infection is responsible for the ulcers,\u00a0 antibiotics \u00a0will also\u00a0be used to kill the bacteria, which should prevent the ulcer coming back. \n If the ulcers are caused by the use of NSAIDs,\u00a0PPIs are usually prescribed and your doctor will discuss whether you should keep using NSAIDs. Alternative medication to NSAIDs, such as\u00a0 paracetamol , may be recommended. \n Stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed. \n Read more about  treating stomach ulcers . \n Possible complications \n Complications of stomach ulcers are relatively\u00a0uncommon, but they can be very serious and potentially life-threatening. The main complications\u00a0include: \n \n bleeding at the site of the ulcer \n the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splitting open \u2013 known as perforation \n the ulcer blocking the movement of food through the digestive system \u2013 known as gastric obstruction \n \n Read more about the  complications of stomach ulcers .", "symptoms": "The most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain that develops in your abdomen (tummy). \n However, some stomach ulcers aren't painful and are only noticed when a  complication of a stomach ulcer \u00a0develops, such as bleeding from the ulcer. \n Tummy pain \n The pain caused by a stomach ulcer can travel out from the middle of your tummy\u00a0up to your neck, down to your belly button, or through to your back. \n It can last from a few minutes to a few hours and often starts within a few hours of eating.\u00a0You may also wake up in pain during the night. \n Taking\u00a0antacids (indigestion medication)\u00a0may relieve the pain temporarily, but it\u00a0will keep coming back if the ulcer isn't treated. \n Other symptoms \n Less common symptoms of a stomach ulcer can include: \n \n  indigestion  \n  heartburn  \n loss of appetite \n feeling and being sick \n weight loss \n \n Some people also find they\u00a0burp or become bloated after eating fatty foods. \n When to seek medical advice \n Visit your GP if you experience persistent symptoms of a stomach ulcer. \n Contact your GP or  NHS 24 111 service \u00a0immediately, or go to\u00a0 your\u00a0nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E)\u00a0department , if you develop signs of a serious complication, including: \n \n vomiting blood\u00a0\u2013 the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance, similar to coffee grounds \n passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools \n a sudden, sharp pain in your\u00a0tummy that gets steadily worse", "causes": "Stomach ulcers are usually caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n These can break down\u00a0the stomach's defence against the acid it produces to digest food,\u00a0allowing the stomach lining to become damaged and an ulcer to form. \n H. pylori bacteria \n H. pylori infections are common, and it's possible to be infected without realising it, because the infection doesn't usually cause symptoms.\u00a0The bacteria live in the stomach lining and people of all ages can be infected. \n However, in some people, the bacteria can irritate the stomach lining and make it more vulnerable to damage from the stomach acid. It's not clear exactly why some people are more\u00a0vulnerable to the effects of H. pylori bacteria than others. \n NSAIDs \n  NSAIDs  are medicines\u00a0widely used to treat pain, a high temperature (fever) and inflammation (swelling). \n Commonly used NSAIDs\u00a0include: \n \n  ibuprofen  \n  aspirin  \n naproxen \n diclofenac \n \n Many people take NSAIDs without having any side effects, but there's always a risk the medication could cause problems, such as stomach ulcers, particularly if taken for a\u00a0long time or at high doses. \n You may be advised not to use NSAIDs if you currently have a stomach ulcer or if you have had one in the past.\u00a0 Paracetamol  can often be used as an alternative painkiller, as it's generally considered safer. \n Lifestyle factors \n It used to be thought that stomach ulcers\u00a0may be\u00a0caused by certain lifestyle factors, such as spicy foods, stress and alcohol. \n There is little hard evidence to confirm that this is the case, but these factors may\u00a0make the symptoms of ulcers worse. \n However, it is thought that smoking increases your risk of developing stomach ulcers and may make treatment less effective.", "treatment": "If you have a stomach ulcer, your treatment will depend on what caused it. With treatment, most ulcers heal in a month or two. \n If your stomach ulcer is caused by an Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection, a course of\u00a0 antibiotics  and a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is recommended. \n This is also\u00a0recommended if\u00a0it's thought\u00a0your stomach ulcer is caused by a combination of\u00a0an H. pylori infection and  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) . \n If your stomach ulcer is just caused by\u00a0taking NSAIDs, a\u00a0course of PPI medication\u00a0is recommended. Your use of NSAIDs will also be reviewed, and taking an alternative painkiller may be advised. \n An alternative type of medication, known as H2-receptor antagonists,\u00a0is occasionally used instead of PPIs, and sometimes you may be given additional medication called\u00a0antacids\u00a0to relieve your symptoms in the short term. \n You may have a repeat gastroscopy after 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks to check that the ulcer has healed. \n There aren't any special lifestyle measures you need to take during treatment, but avoiding stress, alcohol, spicy foods and smoking may reduce your symptoms while your ulcer heals. \n Antibiotics \n If you have an H. pylori infection, you'll usually be prescribed a course of two or three antibiotics, which\u00a0each need to be taken twice a day for a week. \n The antibiotics most commonly used are amoxicillin,\u00a0clarithromycin\u00a0and metronidazole. \n The side effects of these antibiotics are usually mild and can\u00a0include: \n \n feeling and being sick \n  diarrhoea   \n a metallic taste in your mouth \n \n You will be re-tested at least four weeks after finishing your antibiotic course has been completed to see whether there are any H. pylori bacteria left in your stomach. If there are, a further course of eradication therapy using different antibiotics\u00a0may be given. \n Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \n PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces, preventing further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally.\u00a0They're usually prescribed for four to eight weeks. \n Omeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole are the PPIs most commonly used to treat stomach ulcers. Side effects of these are usually mild, but can include: \n \n  headaches  \n diarrhoea or  constipation \u00a0 \n feeling sick \n abdominal (tummy) pain \n dizziness \n rashes \n \n These should pass once treatment has been completed. \n H2-receptor antagonists \n Like PPIs, H2-receptor antagonists work by\u00a0reducing the amount of\u00a0acid your stomach produces. \n Ranitidine\u00a0is the most widely used H2-receptor antagonist for treating stomach ulcers. \n Side effects are uncommon, but may include: \n \n diarrhoea \n headaches \n dizziness \n rashes \n tiredness \n \n Antacids and alginates \n All of the above treatments can take several hours before they start to work, so your GP\u00a0may recommend taking additional antacid medication to neutralise your stomach acid and\u00a0provide immediate, but short-term, symptom relief. \n Some antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate, which produces a protective coating on the lining of your stomach. \n These medications are available to buy over the counter at pharmacies. Your pharmacist can advise on which is most suitable for you. \n Antacids\u00a0should be taken when you experience symptoms or when you expect them, such as after meals or at bedtime. Antacids containing alginates are best taken after meals. \n Side effects of both medications are usually minor and can include: \n \n diarrhoea or constipation \n  wind (flatulence)  \n stomach cramps \n feeling and being sick \n \n Reviewing NSAID use \n If your stomach ulcer has been caused by taking NSAIDs, your GP will want to review your use of them. \n You may be advised to use an alternative painkiller not associated with stomach ulcers, such as\u00a0 paracetamol . Sometimes, an alternative type of NSAID that's less likely to cause stomach ulcers, called a\u00a0COX-2 inhibitor, may be recommended. \n If you are taking low-dose  aspirin  (a NSAID) to reduce your risk of blood clots, your GP will\u00a0tell you whether you need to continue taking it. \n If you do need to keep taking it,\u00a0long-term treatment with a PPI\u00a0or H2-receptor antagonist may be\u00a0prescribed alongside the aspirin, to try to prevent further ulcers. \n It's important\u00a0to understand the potential risks associated with continued NSAID use. You're more likely to develop another stomach ulcer and could\u00a0experience a serious complication, such as internal bleeding.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  complications of stomach ulcers .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP may suspect you have an ulcer, based on your symptoms. They will want to know if you're taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)and may test you for an Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. \n You may be referred\u00a0to hospital for a procedure to look inside your stomach (a\u00a0gastroscopy). \n Testing for H. pylori infection \n If your GP thinks your symptoms may be caused by an H. pylori infection, they may recommend one of the following tests: \n \n urea breath test \u2013 you will be given a special drink\u00a0containing a chemical that is\u00a0broken down\u00a0by H. pylori; your breath is then analysed to see whether or not you have an H. pylori infection \n stool antigen test \u2013 a\u00a0small stool sample\u00a0is tested for the bacteria \n  blood test  \u2013 a sample of your blood is tested for antibodies to the H. pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced naturally in your blood and help to fight infection); this has now largely been replaced by the stool antigen test \n \n If you test positive for H. pylori, you will need treatment to clear the infection, which can heal the ulcer and prevent it from returning. Read more about  treating stomach ulcers . \n Gastroscopy \n In some cases, you may be referred for a gastroscopy\u00a0to look inside your stomach directly\u00a0and see whether you have a stomach ulcer. \n The procedure\u00a0is carried out in hospital and involves passing a thin, flexible tube (an endoscope) with a camera at one end into your mouth and down\u00a0into your stomach and\u00a0first section\u00a0of the small intestine (duodenum). \n You may be given a mild sedative injection before the procedure and have your throat sprayed with a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  to make it more comfortable to pass the endoscope. \n The images taken by the camera will usually confirm or\u00a0rule out\u00a0an ulcer. A small tissue sample may also be taken from your stomach or duodenum, so it can be tested\u00a0for the H. pylori bacteria. \n A gastroscopy is\u00a0usually carried out as an outpatient procedure, which means you won't have to spend the night in hospital."},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Stomach cancer", "introduction": "Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, is a fairly uncommon type of cancer. Around 7,000 people are diagnosed with it each year in the UK. \n The initial\u00a0 symptoms of stomach cancer  are vague and easy to mistake for other less serious\u00a0conditions.\u00a0They include: \n \n persistent\u00a0 indigestion  and  heartburn  \n trapped wind and frequent burping \n feeling very full or bloated after meals \n persistent  stomach pain  \n \n Symptoms of advanced stomach cancer can include: \n \n blood in your stools, or black stools \n loss of appetite \n weight loss \n \n As the early\u00a0symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to those of many other\u00a0conditions, the cancer is often advanced by the time it's diagnosed. It's therefore important to get any possible symptoms of stomach cancer checked by your GP as soon as possible. \n Read more about  diagnosing stomach cancer  \n Who's affected \n The exact cause of stomach cancer is still unclear, although you're more likely to develop it if you: \n \n are male \n are 55 years of age or older \n smoke \n have a diet low in fibre and high in processed food or red meat \n have a diet that contains a lot of salted and pickled foods \n have a stomach infection caused by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria\u00a0 \n \n Read more about the  causes of stomach cancer . \n Types of stomach cancer \n There are several different types of stomach cancer. More than 95% of stomach cancers develop in the cells of the stomach lining and are known as adenocarcinomas. \n Less common types of stomach cancer include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue (tissue that drains away fluid and helps fight infection), and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which develop in the muscle or connective tissue of the stomach wall. \n How stomach cancer is treated \n Many cases of stomach cancer can't be completely cured, but it's still possible to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life using  chemotherapy \u00a0and in some cases\u00a0 radiotherapy  and surgery. \n If operable, surgery can cure stomach cancer as long as all of the cancerous tissue\u00a0can be removed. \n Surgery to remove some or all of the stomach is known as a\u00a0gastrectomy. It will still be possible to eat normally after a gastrectomy, but you'll probably have to adjust the size of your portions.\u00a0 \n Chemotherapy can also be used before surgery to help shrink the tumour and sometimes after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. \n Read more about  treating stomach cancer  \n Living with stomach cancer \n Living with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support. \n Read more about  living with stomach cancer  \n Outlook \n The outlook for stomach cancer depends on several factors, including your age, your general health, and how far the cancer has spread (the stage of the condition). \n Unfortunately, as stomach cancer isn't often picked up until the later stages, the outlook isn't as good as for some other cancers. Of all those with stomach cancer, about: \n \n 42 out of 100 people (42%) will live for at least 1 year after diagnosis \n 19 out of 100 people (19%) will live for at least 5 years after diagnosis \n 15 out of every 100 people (15%)\u00a0will live for at least 10 years after diagnosis \n \n In the UK, around 5,000 people die from stomach cancer each year.", "symptoms": "Many symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to less serious conditions, so it can be difficult to recognise in the early stages. \n Early stage symptoms include: \n \n persistent  indigestion   \n trapped wind and frequent burping \n  heartburn  \n feeling full very quickly when eating \n feeling bloated after eating \n feeling sick \n pain in your stomach or breastbone \n difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) \n vomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages \n \n Advanced stomach cancer \n Symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer include: \n \n blood in your stools, or black stools \n loss of appetite \n weight loss \n tiredness \n lumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid) \n  anaemia \u00a0(a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless) \n yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n \n When to seek medical help \n Stomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it's diagnosed early. It's therefore\u00a0important for your GP to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected. \n Stomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age. \n Indigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. However, it's unlikely that someone with indigestion who's under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer. \n However,\u00a0see your GP if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. They\u00a0should refer you to a specialist for further testing. \n Also see your GP if you have difficulty swallowing. This\u00a0isn't a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated. \n Read more about  diagnosing stomach cancer  \n You can also read more about  being referred to a stomach cancer specialist \u00a0on Cancer Research UK.", "causes": "Stomach cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the stomach, although it's unclear exactly why these changes occur. \n Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means cells grow and reproduce\u00a0uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. \n Left untreated, cancer can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system (a network of vessels and glands called lymph nodes located throughout the body). \n Once the cancer reaches your lymphatic system, it's capable of spreading to other parts of your body, including your blood, bones and organs. \n It's not known what triggers the\u00a0changes in DNA\u00a0that lead to stomach cancer and why only a small number of people develop the condition. \n Increased risk \n However, evidence suggests that a number of different factors can affect your\u00a0chances of developing stomach cancer. These are discussed below. \n Age and gender \n Your risk of developing stomach cancer increases with age. Most cases occur in people aged 55 or over. \n For reasons that are unclear, men are twice as likely as women to develop stomach cancer. \n Smoking \n People who smoke are about twice as likely to develop stomach cancer compared with non-smokers. This is because you swallow some cigarette smoke when you inhale and it ends up in your stomach. Cigarettes contain\u00a0harmful chemicals which can damage the cells in your stomach. \n The more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking, the bigger the risk.\u00a0In the UK, around 1\u00a0in every 5 cases of stomach cancer (20%) is thought to be caused by smoking. \n H. pylori infection \n Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)\u00a0is a common type of bacteria. In most people, these bacteria are harmless, but\u00a0in some people an H. pylori infection can cause problems such as\u00a0 stomach ulcers , recurring bouts of\u00a0 indigestion  or\u00a0long-term inflammation of the stomach lining (chronic atrophic gastritis). \n Research has found\u00a0people with severe chronic\u00a0atrophic gastritis have\u00a0an increased\u00a0risk of developing stomach cancer, although this risk is still small. \n Diet \n A diet rich in pickled vegetables, such as pickled onions or piccalilli, salted fish, salt in general and smoked meats, such as pastrami or smoked beef, increases your risk of stomach cancer. \n Countries where this type of diet is popular, such as Japan, tend to have much higher rates of stomach cancer than the UK. \n A high fibre diet with\u00a0five portions of fruit and vegetables a day\u00a0will help protect against stomach cancer, and a diet high in fats and processed food and red meat will increase your risk of getting stomach cancer. \n Family history \n You're more likely to develop stomach cancer if you have a close relative with the condition, such as one of your parents or a sibling (brother or sister). In such cases, it may be appropriate for your doctor to arrange genetic counselling. \n It's not fully understood why stomach cancer seems to run in families. It may be because of shared risk factors, such as having similar diets or having an H. pylori infection, or because of certain genes you inherit from your parents. \n In around one in 50 cases of stomach cancer, testing has found that people share a mutation in a gene known as E-cadherin. \n Research into stomach cancer has also shown that you may be more at risk of getting the condition if you have the blood type A. Your\u00a0blood type is passed on from your parents, so this could be another way in which family history may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. \n There's also a condition that runs in families called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which may increase your risk of developing stomach cancer. FAP causes small growths, called polyps, to form in your digestive system, and is known to increase your risk of developing  bowel cancer . \n Having another type of cancer \n Your risk of developing stomach cancer is increased if you've had another type of cancer, such as\u00a0 cancer of the oesophagus  or  non-Hodgkin lymphoma  (cancer that develops in your white blood cells). \n For men, the risk of getting stomach cancer is increased after having\u00a0 prostate cancer ,  bladder cancer ,\u00a0 breast cancer \u00a0or  testicular cancer . For women, the risk of developing stomach cancer increases after having\u00a0 ovarian cancer ,  breast cancer  or  cervical cancer . \n Certain medical conditions \n Having certain medical conditions can also increase your risk of developing stomach cancer, such as  pernicious anaemia \u00a0(a vitamin B12 deficiency, which occurs when your body can't absorb it properly), and  peptic stomach ulcers \u00a0(an ulcer in your stomach lining, often caused by H. pylori infection). \n Stomach surgery \n If you've had stomach surgery, or surgery to a part of your body that affects your stomach, you may be more likely to develop stomach cancer. \n This can include surgery to remove part of your stomach (known as a partial gastrectomy), surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve (the nerve that carries information from your brain to organs such as your heart, lungs and digestive system), or surgery to repair a stomach ulcer. \n How stomach cancer spreads \n There are 3 ways stomach cancer can spread: \n \n directly \u2013\u00a0the cancer can spread from the stomach into nearby tissues and organs, such as the pancreas, colon, small intestine and peritoneum (the lining of the inside of the abdominal cavity) \n through\u00a0the lymphatic system \u2013 the lymphatic system is a series of glands (nodes) located throughout your body, similar to the blood circulatory system; the glands produce specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection \n through\u00a0the blood \u2013\u00a0which can cause the cancer to spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, most commonly the liver \n \n Stomach cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic stomach cancer.", "treatment": "The treatments recommended for stomach cancer will depend on your general health and how far the cancer has spread. \n Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams made up of a number of different specialists (see below) who work together to plan and carry out\u00a0the best treatment, tailored to your circumstances. \n Feel free to discuss treatment with your care team at any time and ask questions. \n Your treatment plan \n The main treatments for stomach cancer are surgery,  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy . You may have one of these treatments or a combination. \n If surgery is recommended, you may have chemotherapy beforehand. If the tumour is in the upper part of your stomach, including the junction between the oesophagus and stomach, you may also have radiotherapy prior to surgery. \n Surgery is mainly used if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, whereas chemotherapy and radiotherapy tend to be used when the condition is diagnosed at a later stage. \n Where possible, the primary aim of treatment is to completely\u00a0remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body.\u00a0It's estimated that a cure is possible in 20-30% of stomach cancer cases. \n If it's not possible to remove the tumour, your doctors will focus on trying to prevent it from getting any bigger and causing further harm to your body. This may be done using surgery or chemotherapy.\u00a0 \n In some cases, it's not possible to eliminate the cancer or slow it down. In this case, your treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible, usually with surgery or radiotherapy. \n A relatively new medication called\u00a0trastuzumab (see below) can also be used to treat some types of advanced stomach cancer. \n Your healthcare team will talk to you about which treatments are most suitable. \n Surgery \n If you're diagnosed with stomach cancer at an early stage,\u00a0it may be possible for the cancer to be completely removed during surgery. \n In some cases, it may be possible to pass a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your oesophagus (gullet),\u00a0rather than making incisions in your tummy. This is known as endoscopic surgery, and can be used to\u00a0remove a sample of the tumour for testing ( biopsy ). It can also be used to remove the tumour completely if stomach cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. \n However, if your cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it completely. If this is the case, you may still have surgery to remove any cancer blocking your stomach, to ease your symptoms. This will depend on whether your symptoms can be controlled and the risks and side effects of undertaking major surgery. \n Any type of surgery for stomach cancer will involve a large operation and a long recovery time. If you have stomach cancer surgery, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for around 2 weeks. You'll also need several weeks at home to recover. \n Surgery to remove your stomach \n You may\u00a0need to have part or all of your stomach removed. \n Surgery to remove part of your stomach is known as a partial or sub-total gastrectomy, and surgery to remove all of your stomach is known as a total gastrectomy. In some cases, your surgeon may remove part of your oesophagus as well as all of\u00a0your stomach, using\u00a0a procedure known as an oesophagogastrectomy. \n These operations may be carried out\u00a0using either a large incision in your tummy (open surgery), or a number of smaller incisions through which surgical tools can be passed (laparoscopic or keyhole surgery). Both of these techniques are carried out under  general anaesthetic , which means you'll be unconscious throughout the procedure. \n During these operations, your surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes (small glands that help fight infection) nearest to the cancer. It's possible that your stomach cancer may have spread to these lymph nodes, and removing them helps prevent the cancer returning. \n Partial gastrectomy \n If your cancer is in the lower part of your stomach, you may have a partial gastrectomy\u00a0to\u00a0remove it. \n After surgery, your stomach will be smaller than it was before the operation. However, the top part of your stomach, where your oesophagus feeds into it, won't be affected. \n Total gastrectomy or oesophagogastrectomy \n If your cancer is in the middle or at the top of your stomach, you may need to have a total gastrectomy. If the cancer is close to the end of your oesophagus, where it meets your stomach, you may\u00a0need to have an oesophagogastrectomy. \n If you have a total gastrectomy, the end of your gullet will be joined to the top of your jejunum (the top part of your small intestine). If you have an oesophagogastrectomy, the remaining part of your gullet will be joined to your jejunum. \n Surgery to ease your symptoms \n If your stomach cancer has spread beyond your stomach, it may not be possible to remove it using surgery. \n However, if your stomach has been significantly affected by cancer it can cause a blockage, which prevents food from being properly digested. A blocked stomach can cause symptoms such as stomach pain, vomiting and feeling very full after eating. \n If your stomach is blocked, there are a few options:\u00a0 \n \n stenting \u2013 a stent is a plastic or wire mesh tube inserted through the oesophagus using an endoscope under  local anaesthetic ; after being inserted, the stent will be expanded and open up the stomach\u00a0 \n partial or total gastrectomy \u2013 to remove the blockage and improve your symptoms \n bypass surgery \u2013 an operation where part of your stomach above the blockage is joined to your\u00a0small intestine, leaving the blocked part of your stomach out of your digestive system \n \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy is a specialist treatment for cancer that uses medicines, called cytotoxic medicines,\u00a0to stop cancer cells dividing and multiplying. As it circulates through your body, the medicine can target cancer cells in your stomach and any that may have spread to other parts of your body. \n You may have chemotherapy for stomach cancer before surgery to reduce the amount of cancer that has to be removed during the operation. Chemotherapy can also be used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back. \n Chemotherapy can also help to slow the progression of cancer and ease the symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer, which may not be suitable for surgery. \n If may be given orally (as tablets) or intravenously (by injection or a drip through a vein directly into your bloodstream), or a combination of both. \n Intravenous chemotherapy is usually given in hospital, while oral chemotherapy is taken at home. Chemotherapy is often given in cycles, each usually lasting about three weeks. \n Alternatively, chemotherapy may be administered through a small pump, which gives you a constant low dose over a few weeks or months. The pumps are portable and can be worn at home, which means fewer trips to hospital. \n Side effects of chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy works by preventing cancerous cells from growing rapidly. However, it also destroys non-cancerous cells such as\u00a0hair follicles and red and white blood cells. Side effects may include: \n \n tiredness \n nausea and vomiting \n nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy ) \n  hair loss  \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n  anaemia  (a lack of red blood cells) \n weight loss \n skin changes \u2013 such as redness, swelling and a tingling sensation in the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet \n \n The side effects you experience after having chemotherapy will depend on the type of chemotherapy and the number of treatment sessions you need. You'll be told who to contact if you're experiencing serious side effects from chemotherapy, and it's very important that this contact information is recorded carefully. \n If you experience nausea and vomiting as a result of chemotherapy, you may be able to take anti-sickness medication to counter it. This may be given intravenously (by injection directly into your bloodstream) at the same time as your chemotherapy. \n The side effects of chemotherapy will only last for as long as your course of treatment lasts. Once your treatment is over, the\u00a0hair follicles\u00a0and blood cells\u00a0will repair themselves. This means your hair will grow back, although it might look or feel different from how it did before chemotherapy (for example, it may be a slightly different colour, or be softer or curlier than before). \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy uses beams of high energy\u00a0 radiation  to destroy cancer cells. It's not often used to treat stomach cancer because there's a risk that other organs close to your stomach might be damaged by the treatment. \n However, if you have advanced stomach cancer that's causing pain or bleeding,\u00a0you may need to have radiotherapy. In some cases, following surgery, you may have chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to help prevent the stomach cancer from recurring. \n If a cancer is bleeding slowly and causing  anaemia , a single fraction of radiotherapy can be used to try to prevent further bleeding. \n If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will usually begin 2 or 3 months after surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. This is a painless procedure where you lie under a radiotherapy machine while it directs radiation at your stomach. You'll be positioned by a radiographer (a specialist in radiotherapy) so that the machine targets the cancer cells and avoids as much healthy tissue as possible. \n Radiotherapy often involves having treatment sessions 5 days a week. Each session will only last a few minutes. The radiation doesn't stay in your system afterwards, and it's perfectly safe to be around others between your treatments. \n How long you'll need to have radiotherapy for will depend on how it's used. Radiotherapy used after surgery to help prevent stomach cancer coming back usually lasts 5 weeks. If it's being used to control symptoms of advanced stomach cancer, it may only last 1 or 2 weeks. \n Side effects of radiotherapy \n You may experience the following side effects after having radiotherapy: \n \n tiredness \n nausea \n diarrhoea \n irritation and darkening of your skin where the treatment takes place \n \n These side effects will usually improve within a few weeks of treatment finishing. \n Trastuzumab \n Trastuzumab\u00a0(sold under the brand name Herceptin) is a medication\u00a0used to treat\u00a0 breast cancer  and some cases of advanced stomach cancer. \n Some stomach cancers are stimulated by a type of protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab works by blocking the effects of this protein. This doesn't cure stomach cancer, but\u00a0it can slow its growth and increase survival time. \n If you're diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and tests show high levels of the HER2 protein in the cancerous cells, your doctors may recommend treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab. \n Trastuzumab is given intravenously, through a drip, and you'll have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to 1 hour and you'll usually need a session once every 3 weeks. \n Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. Therefore, it may not be suitable if you have a heart problem such as  angina , uncontrolled high blood pressure ( hypertension ) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you'll also need regular tests on your heart to check for any problems. \n Other side effects of trastuzumab may include: \n \n an initial allergic reaction to the medication, which can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever \n diarrhoea \n tiredness \n aches and pains", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP as soon as possible if you have stomach cancer symptoms such as indigestion, unexpected weight loss, anaemia and persistent vomiting. \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your stomach for any lumpiness or tenderness. If they think that stomach cancer may be a possibility they'll refer you to a specialist for further investigation. \n In 2015, the\u00a0 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and\u00a0 symptoms of stomach cancer  and refer people for the right tests faster.\u00a0Find out  who should be referred for further tests for suspected stomach cancer . \n Hospital tests \n If your GP thinks you may have stomach cancer, they'll refer you to a specialist for tests. \n These may include a  blood test  and chest\u00a0 X-ray , which will assess your overall health. A sample of your stools may also be tested for blood. \n Because of\u00a0the potentially serious nature of stomach cancer, you should be referred to the specialist within two weeks. Read more about  waiting times . \n The\u00a0main tests\u00a0used to diagnose stomach cancer are outlined below. \n Endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound \n An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of your body is examined using a piece of equipment called an endoscope (a long, thin flexible tube with a light and a video camera at the end). \n If you need to have an endoscopy, you won't be able to eat or drink for four to eight hours before the procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and duodenum (top of the small intestine) are empty. \n You'll be awake during the endoscopy, but may be given a sedative by injection to make you feel drowsy and relaxed. A\u00a0 local anaesthetic \u00a0may also be sprayed onto the back of your throat, so the area is numbed. \n The endoscope will be passed down your gullet (food pipe) and into your stomach so the specialist can look for any  stomach ulcers  or signs of cancer. If tissue is found that may be cancerous, a sample will be taken for testing. This procedure is known as a  biopsy . The sample will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory. The results will show whether the cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) and will usually take 7 to 10 days to come back. \n The endoscopy itself usually takes about 15 minutes, although you should allow about 2 hours in total for your visit. \n If your specialist thinks you may have cancer in the top part of your stomach, you may have an  ultrasound scan  at the same time as an endoscopy. This is known as an endoscopic ultrasound and uses high frequency sound waves to produce an image of your stomach (this method is commonly used to view an unborn baby in the womb). \n If you have an endoscopic ultrasound, an ultrasound probe will be attached to the end of the endoscope before it's passed down your throat. The scan will help determine the stage of any cancer in the top part of your stomach. \n After an endoscopy, or an endoscopic ultrasound, you won't be able to drive for several hours because of the sedative. You may also have a  sore throat , although this should pass within a few days. \n Barium meal X-ray \n A barium meal X-ray or barium swallow involves drinking a chalky liquid containing a substance called barium, which makes your stomach show up on an X-ray. Nowadays, however, it's less commonly used to diagnose stomach cancers. \n Organs such as your stomach don't usually show up on an X-ray because they're made of soft tissue that isn't dense enough to stop the X-rays passing through. However, when these organs are filled with barium, it blocks the X-rays and shows up white on an X-ray screen. \n You won't able to eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure because your stomach and duodenum need to be empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system. \n A barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you'll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. You may feel slightly sick, and the barium may cause  constipation . Your stools may be white for a few days afterwards as the barium passes through your system. \n Further testing \n If you're diagnosed with stomach cancer, further tests may be needed to help determine how far it's spread and how quickly it's likely to spread (known as the stage and grade). Your cancer specialist (oncologist) will discuss this with you. \n However, it may not always be possible to identify the exact stage of your condition until your treatment starts. \n Laparoscopy \n Your specialist may need to examine your stomach in more detail to see if the cancer has spread, particularly to the lining of the abdominal cavity (peritoneum). If it has, you may need to have a small operation called a laparoscopy. This procedure is carried out under a  general anaesthetic , so you'll be unconscious during it. \n During the procedure, a thin viewing tube with a camera at the end (a laparoscope) will be inserted into your stomach through a small incision in the lower part of your tummy. In some cases, your specialist may need to examine more than one area of your stomach and make more than one incision. \n Computerised tomography or positron emission tomography scans \n During  CT scans  or  PET scans , a series of X-ray images of your body are taken. A computer is then used to put the images together and create a detailed picture of the inside of your body. \n These scans will help your doctor assess how advanced your cancer is. It allows them to see whether the cancerous cells have formed tumours anywhere else in the body. The scans can also\u00a0help your doctors work out which type of treatment will be most effective and appropriate for you. \n Liver ultrasound scan \n If your specialist thinks your stomach cancer may have spread to your liver, you may need to have a liver  ultrasound . This type of scan uses high frequency sound waves to produce an image of your liver. \n Staging and grading \n After all of the tests have been completed and your test results are known, it should be possible to tell what stage and grade of stomach cancer you have. \n Staging is a measurement of how far cancer has spread. There are a number of different ways stomach cancer can be staged.\u00a0One method uses a numbering system from 1 to 4. The higher the number, the further the cancer has spread. \n The majority of stomach cancers are at stage 3 or 4 when diagnosed, which means a cure isn't\u00a0usually possible. \n Grading describes how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. There are 3 grades of stomach cancer: \n \n low-grade \u2013 the cancer tends to grow slowly \n medium-grade \u2013 the cancer grows a bit\u00a0faster \n high-grade \u2013 the cancer is aggressive and likely to grow quickly \n \n Cancer Research UK has more information about the  staging and grading of stomach cancer ."},

It\u2019s about a type of cancer called soft tissue sarcoma. \n There are several different types of soft tissue sarcoma. The information in this section covers rhabdomyosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, soft tissue Ewing\u2019s sarcoma and fibrosarcomas. These are the most common types in teenagers. If you have a different type and want to know more,\u00a0contact  Macmillan . \n   |If you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0 soft tissue sarcoma  section. \n Soft tissue sarcomas are cancers that develop from cells in the soft, supporting tissues of the body. There are many different types, but the ones that tend to affect teenagers are: \n \n rhabdomyosarcomas \n synovial sarcomas \n soft tissue Ewing\u2019s sarcoma \n fibrosarcomas \n \n Sarcomas can also develop in the bones. This is called osteosarcoma. You can find out more in Macmillan's  bone cancer  section. \n Signs and symptoms of soft tissue sarcomas \n The symptoms of a sarcoma will depend on where it is: \n \n if it\u2019s in an arm or leg, symptoms include a lump or swelling in the limb. This is usually painless, but not always. \n if it\u2019s in the tummy (abdomen), symptoms include a painful, swollen tummy, and problems going to the toilet to poo (called constipation). \n if it\u2019s in your bladder, symptoms include pain in the lower tummy, finding it difficult to wee (pass urine), and having blood in your wee. \n if it\u2019s in the chest, symptoms can include breathlessness, a cough and pain in your chest. \n if it\u2019s in the head or neck, symptoms include a lump, a blockage and discharge from the nose or throat. Occasionally an eye may become swollen and stick out a bit. \n \n You may also have other symptoms, such as tiredness, loss of appetite or weight loss. \n Remember - most people with the symptoms listed here won\u2019t have a sarcoma. \u00a0But if you have any of these symptoms, or are worried that you may have a sarcoma, the first thing to do is to see your GP. They'll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor. \n Causes \n We don't know what causes sarcomas in teenagers and young adults. \n People often think a knock or injury might have caused a sarcoma, but there\u2019s no evidence for this. \n Remember that nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the cancer. \n Types of soft tissue sarcoma \n  Rhabdomyosarcoma  \n This type of sarcoma grows in the active muscles of the body. These are muscles that we have control over, like the muscles we use to move our arms or legs. Rhabdomyosarcomas are most likely to happen in the head, neck, bladder, vagina, arms, legs and trunk.\u00a0 \n There are different types or rhabdomyosarcoma. The most likely one to happen in teenagers and young adults is called an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and affects an arm or a leg.\u00a0 \n To find out more look at\u00a0Macmillan's  rhabdomyosarcoma \u00a0information that is written for all ages. \n  Synovial Sarcoma  \n This type of sarcoma is most likely to happen in the tissue around the joints, like your elbow, knee and ankle. It can also happen in other parts of your body, but that is less common. This type of sarcoma might not be obvious straight away because the lump grows slowly and is usually not sore.\u00a0 \n  Soft tissue Ewing\u2019s sarcoma  \n If you have a type of soft tissue sarcoma called a soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma, it's treated in the same way as a Ewing\u2019s sarcoma in a bone. You can read more about this in Macmillan's  bone cancer  section. \n  Fibrosarcoma  \n This type of sarcoma happens in the fibrous tissue in your body. Fibrous tissue joins the structures inside your body together - like your muscles to bones. You\u2019re most likely to find a fibrosarcoma on your arms, legs or trunk, but they can happen deeper in your body.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n We also have more info about: \n \n  the\u00a0soft tissue  \n  having tests for a soft tissue sarcoma  \n  treatment for a soft tissue sarcoma \u00a0 \n  living with a soft tissue sarcoma  \n \n If you're looking for information about soft tissue sarcomas in people of all ages, see our general\u00a0 soft tissue sarcoma  information.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

But\u00a0in most cases it's a symptom of a viral or bacterial\u00a0infection. \n Common causes \n A sore throat\u00a0is often a symptom of: \n \n  colds \u00a0or\u00a0 flu \u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may also have\u00a0a blocked or runny nose, a  cough , a high temperature (fever), a\u00a0 headache  and general aches \n  laryngitis  (inflammation of the\u00a0voice box)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may also have\u00a0a hoarse voice, a dry cough and a constant need to clear your throat \n  tonsillitis  (inflammation of the tonsils) \u2013\u00a0you may also have red or spotty tonsils,\u00a0discomfort when swallowing and a fever \n strep throat\u00a0(a bacterial throat infection)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may also have swollen glands in your neck, discomfort when swallowing and tonsillitis \n  glandular fever \u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may also feel very tired and have\u00a0a fever and swollen glands in your neck \n \n It may also be caused by something irritating your throat, such as smoke,  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease  (where acid leaks up from the stomach) and\u00a0 allergies . \n Less common causes \n Less often, a sore throat can be a sign of: \n \n quinsy (a painful collection of pus at the back of the throat) \u2013 the pain may be severe and you may also have\u00a0difficulty opening your mouth\u00a0or difficulty swallowing \n epiglottitis\u00a0(inflammation of\u00a0the flap of tissue at the back of the throat) \u2013\u00a0the pain may be severe and you may have\u00a0difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing \n \n These conditions are more serious and should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible (see below). \n When to get medical advice \n You don't usually need to get medical advice\u00a0if you\u00a0have\u00a0a sore throat. \n But it's a good idea to\u00a0contact your GP or if they're not open, phone\u00a0the NHS 24 111 service\u00a0if: \n \n your symptoms are severe \n you have persistent symptoms that\u00a0haven't started to improve after a week \n you experience severe sore throats frequently \n you have a weak immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example, you have\u00a0 HIV , are having\u00a0 chemotherapy , or are taking medication that suppresses your immune system \n \n When to get emergency help \n Very rarely, a sore throat can be a sign of a serious problem. \n Visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department or call 999 for an ambulance immediately if: \n \n your symptoms are severe or getting worse quickly \n you have difficulty breathing \n you're making a high-pitched sound as you breathe (called stridor) \n you have\u00a0 difficulty swallowing  \n you start drooling", "symptoms": "", "causes": "A sore throat is often just one symptom of a bacterial or viral infection, such as the common cold. \n The most common types of bacteria and viruses that may cause a sore throat include: \n \n the rhinovirus, coronavirus and parainfluenza viruses, which normally cause the  common cold  \u2013 these\u00a0are responsible for a quarter of all sore throats \n different types of streptococcal bacteria \u2013 group A streptococcal bacteria cause 10% of sore throats in adults and nearly a third of sore throats in children, with groups C and G also thought to be a cause of sore throats \n \n Other bacteria and viruses each tend to be responsible for less than 5% of sore throats. These include: \n \n types A and B of the flu virus \n adenovirus \u2013 which can also cause  conjunctivitis , an infection in the eye \n herpes simplex virus type 1 \u2013 which normally causes  cold sores  \n the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \u2013 which normally causes  glandular fever  \n \n There are many other,\u00a0rarer, bacteria and viruses that are each\u00a0responsible for less than 1% of sore throats. \n Catching an infection \n The bacterium or virus that causes a sore throat is usually caught from someone else who is already infected. For example, the common cold is spread through tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus,\u00a0launched into the air when someone coughs, sneezes or speaks. \n If you breathe in one of these droplets or touch a surface that has the virus on it, and then touch your face, you may become infected. \n Once you have caught an infection, two types of sore throat can develop. These are: \n \n pharyngitis \u2013 when the area at the back of your throat (the oropharynx) becomes inflamed \n  tonsillitis  \u2013 when your tonsils (the two lumps of tissue either side of your throat) become inflamed \n \n Read more about  treating a sore throat . \n Non-infectious causes \n Less commonly, sore throats can have non-infectious causes. These include: \n \n irritation caused by cigarette smoke or alcohol \n irritation from a nasogastric tube (passed down your nose and into your stomach to provide liquid food if you\u00a0can't eat solid food) \n  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease  \u2013 a condition that causes acid to leak upwards from the stomach into the gullet \n Stevens-Johnson syndrome \u2013 a very severe allergic reaction to medication \n Kawasaki disease \u2013 a rare condition that affects children under five years of age \n  allergies  \u2013 such as  hay fever  (an allergic reaction to pollen or spores) which, in rare cases, may also cause a sore throat \n some blood disorders, such as leukaemia (cancer of the bone marrow) or aplastic anaemia (when the bone marrow does not produce enough blood cells) \n oral mucositis (inflammation of the layer of tissue that lines your mouth), which can be caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy (cancer treatments)", "treatment": "Sore throats are not usually serious and often pass in three to seven days. There are some treatments you can use at home to relieve your symptoms. \n When to see your GP \n You should see your GP if you: \n \n fall into one of the groups of people at risk of developing complications \u2013 this includes anyone with a weakened immune system due to medication, or a condition such as  HIV  \n have persistent symptoms that are not improving or responding to self-care \n \n Visit your nearest  accident and emergency department (A&amp;E)  or call 999 for an ambulance if you have severe symptoms such as: \n \n difficulty breathing or swallowing \n severe pain \n drooling \n a muffled voice \n a high-pitched sound as you breathe (stridor) \n \n Read more about  when to visit your GP . \n Painkillers \n For treating sore throats, over-the-counter painkillers, such as  paracetamol , are usually recommended. These may also help reduce a high temperature (fever). \n You should not take  aspirin  or\u00a0 ibuprofen  if you have: \n \n  asthma  \n current or past stomach problems, such as a  stomach ulcer  \n current or past liver or kidney problems \n \n Children under the age of 16 should never be given aspirin. \n Take painkillers as necessary to relieve your pain. Always read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions so you do not exceed the recommended or prescribed dose. \n Self-care tips \n If you or someone in your family has a sore throat, the tips below may help relieve the symptoms: \n \n avoid food or drink that is too hot, as this could irritate the throat \n eat cool, soft food and drink cool or warm liquids \n adults and older children can suck lozenges, hard sweets, ice cubes or ice lollies \n avoid smoking and smoky environments \n regularly gargling with a mouthwash of warm, salty water may help reduce swelling or pain \n drink enough fluids, especially if you have a fever \n \n Steam inhalation is not recommended, as it's unlikely to help a sore throat and there is a risk of scalding. \n Antibiotics \n The use of  antibiotics  is not usually recommended for treating sore throats. This is because most sore throats are not caused by bacteria. \n Even if your sore throat is caused by bacteria, antibiotics have very little effect on the severity of the symptoms and how long they last, and may cause unpleasant  side effects . \n Overusing antibiotics to treat minor ailments can also make them less effective in the treatment of life-threatening conditions. This is known as antibiotic resistance. \n Antibiotics are usually only prescribed if: \n \n your sore throat is particularly severe \n you are at increased risk of a severe infection \u2013 for example\u00a0because you have a weakened immune system due to HIV or  diabetes  (a long-term condition caused by too much glucose in the blood) \n you are at risk of having a weakened immune system \u2013 there are some medications that can cause this, such as carbimazole (to treat an  overactive thyroid gland ) \n you have a history of rheumatic fever (a condition that can cause widespread inflammation throughout the body) \n you have valvular heart disease (a disease affecting the valves in your heart, which control blood flow) \n you experience repeated infections caused by the group A streptococcus bacteria \n \n Delayed antibiotics prescription \n If your GP thinks you might need antibiotics, they may issue a prescription but ask you to wait up to three days for symptoms to improve. \n If your sore throat gets worse, or has not improved after three days, you should have instructions to either: \n \n take your prescription slip to a pharmacy \n return to the GP surgery after three days to collect your medication \n \n Recent studies show that complications of a sore throat are\u00a0uncommon and usually not serious. A delayed antibiotic prescription seems to be as effective as an immediate prescription in reducing complications. \n Using a\u00a0delayed prescription provides similar benefits to an immediate prescription. Most importantly, this\u00a0helps you to avoid taking antibiotics when they're not needed and helps\u00a0prevent antibiotic resistance. \n Tonsillectomy \n A tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the tonsils (the two lumps of tissue on either side of your throat). If your child has repeated infections of the tonsils (tonsillitis), a tonsillectomy may be considered. \n Read more about  treating tonsillitis . \n Persistent sore throat \n If you have a persistent sore throat (one that lasts three to four weeks), your GP may refer you for further tests. This is because your sore throat may be a symptom of a more serious condition. Some possibilities are described below. \n Glandular fever \n If you are 15-25 years of age with a persistent sore throat, you may have  glandular fever  (also known as infectious mononucleosis, or mono). This is a type of viral infection with symptoms that can last up to six weeks. \n Cancer \n A persistent sore throat can also be a symptom of some types of cancer, such as throat cancer. This type of cancer is rare and mainly affects people over the age of 50. In the UK every year, 5,300 people are diagnosed with cancer of the oropharynx (the area at the back of your throat) or mouth. \n Read more about  mouth cancer  \n Non-infectious causes \n In some cases, a sore throat may be caused by substances that irritate the throat. Sources can include: \n \n alcohol \n cigarette smoke \n an  allergy  \u2013 such as  hay fever  \n  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)  \u2013 when stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the gullet \n \n You may find that avoiding these substances, or seeking treatment for an  allergy  or GORD, can help to reduce symptoms of a sore throat. \n Giving up smoking \n If you smoke, giving up will reduce irritation to your throat and strengthen your defences against infection. \n The  Quit Your Way Scotland service \u00a0can offer you advice and encouragement to help you quit smoking.\u00a0Phone Quit Your Way Scotland free on\u00a0 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day).  \n Your GP or pharmacist will also be able to give you help and advice about giving up smoking, or you can read more about  quitting smoking . \n Preventing a sore throat \n As sore throats are caused by bacterial or viral infections, they can be difficult to prevent. \n If you have a sore throat caused by an infection, you can help prevent the infection spreading by practising good hygiene, such as washing your hands regularly and keeping surfaces clean and free of germs.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Stillbirth", "introduction": "A stillbirth is a baby born dead after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy. \n If the baby dies before 24 completed weeks, it's known as a\u00a0 miscarriage  or late foetal loss. \n Stillbirth is more common than many people think.\u00a0There are more than 3,600 stillbirths every year in the UK, and one in every 200 births ends in a stillbirth. Eleven babies are stillborn every day in the UK, making it 15 times more common than  cot death . \n What causes stillbirth? \n Around a half of all stillbirths are linked to placental complications. This means that for some reason the placenta (the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's and nourishes the baby in the womb) isn't functioning properly. \n About 10% of stillborn babies have some kind of birth defect that contributed to their death. A small percentage of stillbirths are caused by problems with the mother's health, for example  pre-eclampsia , or other problems, including cord accidents and infections.\u00a0 \n Read more about\u00a0 causes of stillbirth  \n What happens when a baby dies in the womb? \n If it's suspected that your baby may have died during your pregnancy, a handheld Doppler device or an  ultrasound scan  can be used to check your baby's heartbeat. \n If your baby has died and there's no immediate risk to your health, you'll usually be given time to think about what you want to do next. \n You\u00a0may be able to choose whether you would like to wait for labour to begin naturally, or if you want it to be started with medication (induced). \n If your health is at risk, the baby may need to be delivered as soon as possible. It's rare for a stillborn baby to be delivered\u00a0by caesarean section. \n At this stage, it's common for parents to ask why their baby died. Those caring for you may give you some basic information about tests to try to find out why your baby died. \n Read more about  how stillbirths happen  \n After a stillbirth \n After a stillbirth, many parents want to see and hold their baby. You may also wish to give your baby a name and create memories by taking photographs or a lock of hair. It's completely up to you what you want to do.\u00a0Decisions about what to do are very personal and there\u2019s no right or wrong way to respond. \n Finding out why a stillbirth has happened can be helpful\u00a0with the grieving process and provide information if you want to get pregnant in the future, so you'll be offered tests to try to find out why your baby died. \n By law, all stillborn babies have to be formally registered. In Scotland, this must be done within 21 days of your baby's birth. \n A senior doctor will discuss the test results and post-mortem (if you decided to have one) during a follow-up appointment several weeks after the birth. You may also want to discuss any possible effects on future pregnancies. \n Read more about  what happens after a stillbirth  \n Help and support \n Stillbirth and late miscarriage can be devastating for the baby's parents, and they can also affect wider family members, including children and friends. \n You may find it helpful to discuss your feelings with your GP, community midwife or health visitor, or with other parents who've lost a baby. \n There are many\u00a0support groups in the UK for bereaved parents and their families. \n Find further information and support around\u00a0 bereavement  \n Some of these groups are run by parents who've experienced stillbirth, or by healthcare professionals, such as baby loss support workers or specialist midwives. \n Read more about  stillbirth support \u00a0 \n Can stillbirths be prevented? \n Not all stillbirths can be prevented. However, there are some things\u00a0you can do to reduce your risk of having a stillbirth, such as: \n \n  stopping smoking  \n avoiding  alcohol and drugs during pregnancy \u00a0\u2013 these can seriously affect your baby's development and increase the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth \n attending all your\u00a0 antenatal appointments \u00a0so that midwives can monitor the growth and wellbeing of your baby \n \n Read more about  preventing stillbirth  \n Information about you \n If you\u00a0have experienced a\u00a0stillbirth, your clinical team may pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists to understand more about this complication. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register", "symptoms": "", "causes": "A large proportion of stillbirths seem to happen in otherwise healthy babies and the cause often can't be explained. \n However, many stillbirths are linked to placental complications. This means that for some reason the placenta (the organ that links the baby's blood supply to the mother's and nourishes the baby in the womb) isn't functioning properly. \n A poorly functioning placenta may be the direct cause of stillbirth, or it may contribute to it because the baby's growth has been held back. \n If there have been problems with the placenta, stillborn babies are usually born perfectly formed, though often small. With more research, it's hoped that placental causes may become better understood, leading to better detection of placental problems and better care for these babies. \n Other conditions that can cause stillbirth or may be associated with stillbirth include: \n \n bleeding (haemorrhage) before or during labour \n placental\u00a0abruption \u2013 where the placenta separates from the womb before the baby is born (this may be associated with bleeding or abdominal pain) \n  pre-eclampsia \u00a0\u2013 a condition that causes\u00a0 high blood pressure  in the mother \n a problem with the umbilical cord,\u00a0which attaches the placenta to the baby's tummy button \u2013 the cord can slip down through the entrance of the womb before the baby is born (cord prolapse), or it can be wrapped around the baby and become knotted\u00a0 \n intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) or  obstetric cholestasis  \u2013 a liver disorder during pregnancy characterised by severe itching \n a genetic physical defect in the baby \n pre-existing  diabetes  \n infection in the mother that also affects the baby \n \n Infections \n Around one in 10 stillbirths are caused by an infection. The most common type of infection is a bacterial infection that travels from the vagina into the womb (uterus). These bacteria include group B streptococcus, escherichia coli (E.coli), klebsiella, enterococcus, haemophilus influenza, chlamydia, and mycoplasma or ureaplasma. \n Some bacterial infections, such as chlamydia\u00a0and mycoplasma or ureaplasma, which are  sexually transmitted infections (STIs) , can be prevented using barrier  contraception , such as  condoms . \n Other infections that can cause stillbirths include:\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n rubella \u2013 commonly known as German measles \n  flu \u00a0\u2013 it's recommended that all pregnant women have the seasonal  flu vaccine  irrespective of their stage of pregnancy \n parvovirus B19 \u2013 this causes  slapped cheek syndrome , a common childhood infection that's dangerous for pregnant women \n coxsackie virus \u2013 this can cause  hand, foot and mouth disease  in humans \n cytomegalovirus\u00a0\u2013 a common virus spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva or urine, which often causes few symptoms in the mother \n herpes simplex \u2013 the virus that causes  cold sores  \n  listeriosis  \u2013 an infection that usually develops after eating food contaminated by bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes (listeria); see  preventing stillbirth  for more information about the foods to avoid during pregnancy \n leptospirosis\u00a0\u2013 a bacterial infection spread by animals such as mice and rats \n  Lyme disease \u00a0\u2013 a bacterial infection spread by infected ticks \n Q fever\u00a0\u2013 a bacterial infection caught from animals such as sheep, goats and cows \n toxoplasmosis\u00a0\u2013 an infection caused by a parasite found in soil and cat faeces \n  malaria \u00a0\u2013 a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes \n \n Increased risk \n There are also a number of things that may increase your risk of having a stillborn baby, including: \n \n  having twins or a multiple pregnancy  \n having a baby who doesn't reach his or her growth potential in the womb \n being over 35 years of age \n smoking, drinking alcohol or misusing drugs while pregnant \n being  obese  (having a body mass index (BMI) over 30) \n having a pre-existing physical health condition such as  epilepsy  \n \n Baby's growth \n Your midwife will check the growth and wellbeing of your baby at each  antenatal appointment , and they'll plot your baby's growth on a chart to ensure he or she is continuing to grow. \n Every baby is different and should grow to the size that's normal for him or her (some babies are naturally small). However, all babies should continue to grow steadily throughout the pregnancy. \n If a baby is smaller than expected, or his or her growth pattern tails off as the pregnancy continues, it may be because the placenta isn't working properly. This increases the risk of stillbirth. \n Problems with a baby's growth should be picked up during antenatal appointments. However, it's important to be aware of your baby's movements and let your midwife know immediately if you notice a reduction in the baby\u2019s movements. \n See  preventing stillbirth  for more information", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Slapped cheek syndrome", "introduction": "Slapped cheek syndrome (also called fifth disease or parvovirus B19) is a viral infection that's most common in children, although it can affect people of any age. It usually causes a bright red rash on the cheeks. \n Although the rash can look alarming, slapped cheek syndrome is normally a mild infection that clears up by itself in one to three weeks. Once you've had the infection, you're usually immune to it for life. \n However, slapped cheek syndrome can be more serious for some people. If you're pregnant, have a blood disorder or a weakened immune system and have been exposed to the virus, you should get medical advice. \n This page covers: \n  Symptoms  \n  When to get medical advice  \n  What to do if you or your child has it  \n  How\u00a0you get it  \n  Prevention  \n Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome \n Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4-14 days after becoming infected, but sometimes may not appear for up to 21 days. \n Initial symptoms \n Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won't\u00a0notice\u00a0any\u00a0early symptoms, but most people will\u00a0have the following symptoms for a few days: \n \n a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38C (100.4F) \n a runny nose\u00a0 \n a\u00a0 sore throat  \n a  headache  \n an upset stomach \n feeling generally unwell \n \n The infection is most contagious during this initial period. \n In adults,\u00a0these symptoms are often\u00a0accompanied by\u00a0joint pain and stiffness, which\u00a0may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed. \n Slapped cheek rash \n After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (the so-called \"slapped cheeks\") normally appears, although adults may not get this. \n By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious. \n After another few days, a light pink rash\u00a0may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy. \n The rashes will normally fade within a\u00a0week or two, although occasionally the body rash may come and go\u00a0for a few\u00a0weeks after the infection has passed. This\u00a0can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress. \n When to get medical advice \n You don't usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome, as the condition normally gets better on its own. \n However, you should contact your GP, call the NHS 24 111 service or contact your local out-of-hours service\u00a0if you have been exposed to anyone with slapped cheek or you have symptoms of the infection and: \n \n you're pregnant \u2013 infection in pregnancy, particularly early pregnancy, carries a risk of causing\u00a0 miscarriage ,\u00a0 stillbirth  or other complications; however, this risk is small and most pregnant women will already be immune. Read more about the  risks of slapped cheek syndrome in pregnancy . \n you have a blood disorder, such as\u00a0sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, or a weakened immune system \u2013 the infection can cause severe\u00a0anaemia that may need to be treated in hospital \n you have symptoms of severe anaemia, such as very pale skin, severe\u00a0 shortness of breath , extreme tiredness or\u00a0fainting \n \n In these cases, a\u00a0 blood test  may be carried out to see if you're immune to the infection. If you're not immune, you'll be monitored carefully to check for any problems. \n If you develop severe anaemia, it's likely that you'll need to be admitted to hospital and\u00a0have a\u00a0 blood transfusion  to replace your damaged\u00a0blood cells. \n What to do if you or your child has slapped cheek \n Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment. \n If you or your child is feeling unwell, you can try the following to ease the symptoms: \n \n rest and\u00a0drink plenty of fluids \u2013 babies should continue their normal feeds \n for a fever, headaches or joint pain, you can take painkillers, such as  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen  \u2013 children\u00a0under 16 shouldn't take aspirin \n to reduce itchiness, you can take antihistamines or use an emollient (moisturising lotion) \u2013 some antihistamines are not suitable for young children, so check with your pharmacist first \n \n Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, there\u2019s no need to stay away from school or work once the rash has developed, as the infection is no longer contagious by this point. \n It's a good idea to notify your child's school about the infection, so children who develop early symptoms can be spotted quickly and vulnerable people can be made aware that they may need to get medical advice. \n How do you get slapped cheek syndrome? \n Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is\u00a0found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection. \n The\u00a0virus is spread in a similar way\u00a0to\u00a0 colds  and  flu .\u00a0You can become infected by:\u00a0 \n \n inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection \n touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose \n \n Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the\u00a0period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on. \n Preventing slapped cheek syndrome \n It's very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms. \n However, making sure that everyone in your household washes their hands frequently may help stop the infection from spreading. \n There's currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Soft tissue sarcomas", "introduction": "Soft tissue sarcomas are a group of rare cancers affecting the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures and organs. \n Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments. \n Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in almost any part of the body, including the legs, arms\u00a0and the trunk (torso). \n There are many different types of soft tissue sarcoma, depending on where in the body they are located. For example: \n \n leiomyosarcomas \u2013 which develop in muscle tissue \n liposarcomas \u2013 which develop in fat tissue \n angiosarcomas \u2013 which develop in the cells of the blood or lymph vessels \n gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) - which can develop in\u00a0the connective tissues that support the organs of the digestive system \n \n Soft tissue sarcomas account for around 1 in every 100 cancers diagnosed in the UK. More than 3,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. \n What causes soft tissue sarcomas? \n Cancer develops when cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumours.\u00a0 \n In the vast majority of soft tissue sarcomas it's unclear what causes this to happen but there are a number of factors known to increase the risk, including: \n \n age \u2013 soft tissue sarcomas can occur at any age, including in children, but they are more common in middle-aged or elderly people and your risk increases as you get older \n certain genetic conditions \u2013 some genetic conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and  retinoblastoma , are associated with an increased risk of soft tissue sarcomas \n previous  radiotherapy  \u2013 some people who have previously had radiotherapy for another type of cancer develop a soft tissue sarcoma, often many years after their previous treatment \n exposure to certain chemicals \u2013 exposure to some chemicals, including vinyl chloride, dioxins and phenoxyacetic herbicides, has been associated with increased rates of soft tissue sarcomas \n \n One particular type of soft tissue sarcoma called  Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma  \u2013 which develops in skin cells \u2013 is caused by a virus known as the human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) infecting someone with a weakened immune system (such as people with  HIV ). \n Signs and symptoms \n As soft tissue sarcomas can develop in most parts of the body, they can cause a wide range of symptoms. \n For example, a tumour near the stomach may cause  abdominal (tummy) pain , a feeling of fullness and  constipation , whereas a tumour near the lungs may cause a  cough  or  breathlessness . \n There are often no obvious symptoms in the early stages of soft tissue sarcomas, although you may notice a soft, painless lump under your skin or deeper, that can't easily be moved around and gets bigger over time. \n You should see your GP if you have a worrying lump or any other troublesome symptoms. A lump the size of a golf ball or larger should be regarded as suspicious and needs to be investigated urgently. \n Although it is much more likely you have a benign (non-cancerous) condition, it is important to get your symptoms checked out. \n Diagnosing soft tissue sarcomas \n If your GP feels there is a possibility you do have cancer, they will refer you for a number of hospital tests to confirm whether you have a soft tissue sarcoma. \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of\u00a0soft tissue sarcoma\u00a0and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected soft tissue sarcoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n A diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma will usually be made by a hospital specialist and will be based on your symptoms, a physical examination, and the results of: \n \n a\u00a0 biopsy  \u2013 where a sample of suspected cancerous tissue is removed using a needle or during an operation so it can be tested and analysed in a laboratory \n imaging tests \u2013 a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  is the main type of scan carried out to assess soft tissue sarcomas, although other scans may also be carried out \n \n If a diagnosis of a soft tissue sarcoma is confirmed, these tests will also help determine how far the cancer has spread (known as the 'stage') and how aggressive the cancer is (known as the 'grade'). \n Treating soft tissue sarcomas \n If you're diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma your care team of specialist doctors and nurses will help you decide on the most appropriate treatment. \n Treatment depends on factors such as the stage and grade of the cancer, the location of any tumours, and your age and general health. \n The main treatments used are: \n \n surgery \u2013 to remove any tumours \n radiotherapy \u2013 where high-energy radiation is used to kill cancer cells \n  chemotherapy  \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells \n \n These treatments are described in more detail below. \n Surgery \n Surgery is the main treatment for soft tissue sarcomas that are detected at an early stage. \n It involves removing the cancerous tumour along with a section of surrounding healthy tissue. This will help ensure no cancer cells are left behind. \n Every effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and functionality of the affected body part. \n But there is a possibility you'll have some difficulty using the part of the body that is operated on after surgery and sometimes reconstructive plastic surgery may be needed to repair significant damage. \n In a small number of cases, there may be no option but to  amputate  the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg. \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy is often used after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells. This is carried out using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at a defined treatment area. \n Radiotherapy may also sometimes be used before surgery to make a tumour easier to remove, or as part of your treatment to reduce your symptoms if surgery is not possible. \n Common side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and  hair loss  in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing. \n Read more about the  side effects of radiotherapy  \n Chemotherapy \n Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy is sometimes used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given anti-cancer medication directly into a vein (intravenously). \n Chemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that cannot be surgically removed. \n Chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body's cells, and can cause a number of temporary but unpleasant side effects, such as feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss from several parts of the body. \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy  \n Outlook \n As with most types of cancer, the outlook for a soft tissues sarcoma depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced when it is diagnosed. \n If the cancer is detected at an early stage and can be removed during surgery, there is a possibility it can be cured. \n But you'll need regular check-ups following treatment to check for any signs the cancer has come back. You may also need long-term physiotherapy and  occupational therapy  to help you manage any physical difficulties resulting from surgery. \n A\u00a0cure is not usually possible if a soft tissue sarcoma is only detected at a late stage when it has already spread to other parts of the body, although treatment can help slow the spread of the cancer and control your symptoms. \n Overall, around half of those diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma will live at least five years from the point of their diagnosis. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  soft tissue sarcomas  \n Macmillan:  soft tissue sarcomas  \n Sarcoma UK:  what is sarcoma?", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Skin cancer (non-melanoma)", "introduction": "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin. \n The term 'non-melanoma' distinguishes these more common kinds of skin cancer from the less common skin cancer known as  melanoma , which spreads faster in the body. \n The first sign of non-melanoma skin cancer is usually the appearance of a lump or patch on the skin that doesn't heal after a few weeks. \n In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm, while cancerous patches are often flat and scaly. \n See your GP if you have any skin abnormality that hasn't healed after four weeks. Although it is unlikely to be skin cancer, it is best to be sure. \n Read more about the  symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer  \n Types of non-melanoma skin cancer \n Non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop. \n The 2 most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are: \n \n basal cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the bottom of the epidermis and accounts for about 75% of skin cancers \n squamous cell carcinoma \u2013 starts in the cells lining the top of the epidermis and accounts for about 20% of skin cancers \n \n Although not classed as non-melanoma skin cancers,  actinic keratoses \u00a0and  Bowen's disease \u00a0may sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. \n Why does it happen? \n Non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps. \n In addition to UV light overexposure, there are certain things that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer, such as: \n \n a family history of the condition \n pale skin that burns easily \n a large number of moles or freckles \n \n Read more about the  causes of non-melanoma skin cancer  \n Who is affected? \n Non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. There are more than 100,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer every year in the UK. \n Non-melanoma skin cancer affects slightly more men than women. \n Diagnosis \n Your GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer. \n Your GP may refer you urgently, within 2 weeks, for squamous cell skin cancer. Basal cell skin cancers usually don't need an urgent referral but you should still see a specialist within 18 weeks. Read a  guide to NHS waiting times . \n The specialist will examine your skin again and will perform a  biopsy  to confirm a diagnosis of skin cancer. \n A biopsy is an operation that removes some affected skin so it can be studied under a microscope. \n Read more about  diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer  \n Treating non-melanoma skin cancer \n Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin. \n Other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). \n Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer is generally successful as, unlike most other types of cancer, there is a considerably lower risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body. \n It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5% of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma, which spreads to other parts of the body in around 2-5% of cases. \n Treatment for\u00a0non-melanoma skin cancer\u00a0is completely successful in approximately 90% of cases. \n Read more about  treating non-melanoma skin cancer  \n Complications \n If you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe. \n If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your non-melanoma skin cancer returning, you will probably require regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be shown how to examine your skin to check for tumours. \n Prevention \n Non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light. \n You can help protect yourself from\u00a0 sunburn  by using sunscreen, dressing sensibly in the sun and limiting the time you spend in the sun during the hottest part of the day. \n Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. \n Regularly checking your skin for signs of skin cancer can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment. \n Read more about  sunscreen and sun safety", "symptoms": "The main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn't heal. \n The lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour. \n Non-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and\u00a0shoulders. \n Basal cell carcinoma \n Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually\u00a0appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or 'waxy' looking.\u00a0It can also look like a red, scaly patch. \n The lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer. \n Squamous cell carcinoma \n Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump\u00a0and may have\u00a0a flat, scaly and crusted surface. \n The lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer. \n Bowen's disease \n Bowen's disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as \"squamous cell carcinoma in situ\". It develops slowly and is easily\u00a0treated.\u00a0 \n The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of the skin. \n When to\u00a0seek medical advice \n If you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn't healed after 4 weeks, see your GP.

UVB is thought to be the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer. \n Artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer. \n Repeated  sunburn , either by the sun or artificial sources of light, will make your skin more vulnerable to non-melanoma skin cancer. \n Family history \n Research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased. \n Increased risk \n Certain factors are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including: \n \n pale skin that does not tan easily \n red or blonde hair \n blue eyes \n older age \n a large number of moles \n a large number of freckles \n an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment \n a condition that suppresses your immune system, such as  HIV  \n medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants), commonly used after organ transplants \n exposure to certain chemicals, such as creosote and arsenic \n a previous diagnosis of skin cancer \n \n  Want to know more?  \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Skin cancer risks and causes . \n Macmillan:  Risk factors and causes of skin cancer .", "treatment": "Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer, although it may depend on your individual circumstances. \n Overall, treatment is successful for more than 90% of people with non-melanoma skin cancer. \n People with cancer should be cared for by a team of specialists that often includes a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, an oncologist (a radiotherapy and chemotherapy specialist), a pathologist and a specialist nurse. \n If you have non-melanoma skin cancer, you may see several (or all) of these professionals as part of your treatment. \n When deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider: \n \n the type of cancer you have \n the stage of your cancer (how big it is and how far it has spread) \n your general health \n \n Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. \n Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you would like to ask the specialist.

A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually from a part of your body where any scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. \n In many cases, this operation is enough to cure skin cancer. \n Curettage and electrocautery \n Curettage and electrocautery is a similar technique to surgical excision, but is only suitable for cases where the cancer is quite small. \n The surgeon will use a small, spoon-shaped blade to remove the cancer and an electric needle to remove the skin surrounding the wound. The procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure the cancer is completely removed. \n Cryotherapy \n Cryotherapy uses cold treatment to destroy the cancer. It is sometimes used for non-melanoma skin cancers in their early stages. Liquid nitrogen is used to freeze the cancer, and this causes the area to scab over. \n After about a month, the scab containing the cancer will fall off your skin. Cryotherapy may leave a small white scar on your skin. \n Mohs micrographic surgery \n Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is used to treat non-melanoma skin cancers when: \n \n it's felt there is a high risk of the cancer spreading or returning \n the cancer is in an area where it would be important to remove as little skin as possible, such as the nose or eyes \n \n It involves removing the tumour bit by bit, as well as a small area of skin surrounding it. This minimises the removal of healthy tissue and reduces scarring. \n Each time a piece of tissue is removed, it is checked for cancer. The procedure may need to be repeated two or three times to ensure\u00a0the cancer is completely removed. \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy involves using medicines to kill cancerous cells. In the case of non-melanoma skin cancer, chemotherapy is only recommended when the tumour is contained within the top layer of the skin. \n This type of chemotherapy involves applying a cream containing cancer-killing medicines to the affected area. As only the surface of the skin is affected, you will not experience the side effects associated with other forms of chemotherapy, such as vomiting or hair loss. However, your skin may feel sore for several weeks afterwards. \n Photodynamic therapy (PDT) \n Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat basal cell carcinoma,\u00a0Bowen's disease and actinic keratoses. It involves using a cream which makes the skin highly sensitive to light. \n After the cream has been applied, a strong light source is shone onto the affected area of your skin, which kills the cancer. PDT may cause a burning sensation and around 2% of people who have this treatment will be left with some superficial scarring. \n Imiquimod cream \n Imiquimod cream is a treatment for basal cell carcinoma with a diameter of less than 2cm (0.8 inches). It's also used to treat actinic keratoses. Imiquimod encourages your immune system to attack the cancer in the skin. \n Common side effects of imiquimod include redness, flaking or peeling skin\u00a0and itchiness. \n Less common and more serious side effects of imiquimod include blistering or ulceration of your skin. \n Wash the cream off and contact your GP if your skin blisters or you develop ulcers after using it. \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy involves using low doses of radiation to destroy the cancer. The level of radiation involved is perfectly safe. However, your skin may feel sore for a few weeks after radiotherapy. \n Radiotherapy is sometimes used to treat basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if: \n \n surgery would be unsuitable \n the cancer covers a large area \n the area is difficult to operate on \n \n Radiotherapy is sometimes used after surgical excision to try to prevent the cancer coming back. This is called adjuvant radiotherapy. \n Electrochemotherapy \n Electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. It may be considered if: \n \n surgery isn't suitable or hasn't worked \n radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven't worked \n \n The procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).\u00a0Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes. \n These electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour. The procedure\u00a0is usually\u00a0carried out using general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) but some people may\u00a0be able to have\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're awake but the area is numbed). \n Depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers. \n It usually takes around six weeks for results to appear\u00a0and the procedure usually needs to be repeated. \n Your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option. \n Read the NICE (2013) guidelines on  Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin . \n  Want to know more?  \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Treating skin cancer  .  \n Macmillan:  Treatment for skin cancer .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "A diagnosis of non-melanoma skin cancer will usually begin with a visit to your GP who will examine your skin and decide whether you need further assessment by a specialist. \n Some GPs take digital photographs of suspected tumours so they can email them to a specialist for assessment. \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of\u00a0skin cancer\u00a0and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected skin cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n Biopsy \n If skin cancer is suspected, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or specialist plastic surgeon. The specialist should be able to confirm the diagnosis by carrying out a physical examination. \n However, they will probably also\u00a0perform a  biopsy  \u2013 a surgical procedure where either a part or all of the tumour is removed and studied under a microscope. This is usually carried out under a  local anaesthetic , meaning you will be awake, but the affected area will be numbed so you won't feel pain. \n This allows the dermatologist or plastic surgeon to determine what type of skin cancer you have and whether there is any chance the cancer could spread to other parts of your body. \n Sometimes, skin cancer can be diagnosed and treated at the same time. In other words, the tumour can be removed and tested and you may not need further treatment because the cancer is unlikely to spread. \n It may be several weeks before you receive the results of a biopsy. \n Further tests \n If you have basal cell carcinoma (BCC), then you usually won't require further tests, as the cancer is unlikely to spread. \n However, in rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, further tests may be needed to make sure the cancer has not spread to another part of your body. \n These tests may include a physical examination of your lymph nodes (glands found throughout your body). If cancer has spread, it may cause your glands to swell. \n If the dermatologist or plastic surgeon thinks there is a high risk of the cancer spreading, it may be necessary to perform a biopsy on a lymph node. This is called a fine needle aspiration (FNA). \n During FNA, cells are removed using a needle and syringe so they can be examined. Finding cancerous cells in a nearby lymph node would suggest the squamous cell carcinoma has started to spread to other parts of your body."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Skin cancer (melanoma)", "introduction": "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body. \n The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new\u00a0mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected. \n In most cases, melanomas have an irregular shape and more than one colour. They may also be larger than normal moles and can sometimes be itchy or bleed. \n An \"ABCDE checklist\" has been developed for people to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  symptoms of melanoma . \n These pages mainly cover a type of melanoma known as superficial spreading melanoma, which accounts for around 70% of all melanomas in the UK. \n Other types of melanoma are summarised below. \n Nodular melanoma \n Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren't regularly exposed to the sun. \n Lentigo maligna melanoma \n Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years. \n Acral lentiginous melanoma\u00a0 \n Acral lentiginous melanoma\u00a0is\u00a0a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin. \n Cancer Research UK has more information about the  different types of melanoma . \n Why does melanoma happen? \n Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It is thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible. \n Certain things can increase your chances of developing melanoma, such as having: \n \n lots of moles or freckles \n pale skin that burns easily \n red or blonde hair \n a family member who has had melanoma \n \n Read more about the  causes of melanoma . \n Diagnosing melanoma \n See your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma. \n In most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and studied to see if it is cancerous. This is known as a  biopsy . \n You may also have a test to check if melanoma has spread elsewhere in your body. This is known as a\u00a0sentinel node biopsy. \n Read more about  diagnosing melanoma . \n How is melanoma treated? \n The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances. \n If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an\u00a0early stage, surgery is usually successful. \n If melanoma isn't diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines, such as  chemotherapy . \n Read more about  treating melanoma . \n Once\u00a0you\u00a0have had melanoma, there is a chance it may return. This risk is increased if your cancer was widespread and severe. \n If your cancer team feels there is a significant risk of your melanoma returning, you will probably need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You will also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns. \n Who is affected \n Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK with around 13,000 new cases of melanoma\u00a0diagnosed each year. \n More than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It's also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds. \n More than 2,000 people die every year in the UK\u00a0from melanoma. \n Can melanoma be prevented? \n Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light. \n You can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided. \n Regularly checking your\u00a0moles and freckles\u00a0can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment.", "symptoms": "The first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole. \n Normal\u00a0moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and\u00a0no\u00a0bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter. \n See your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months. \n Signs to look out for include a mole that is: \n \n getting bigger \n changing shape \n changing colour \n bleeding or becoming crusty \n itchy or painful \n \n A\u00a0helpful\u00a0way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist: \n \n Asymmetrical \u2013 melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape. \n Border \u2013 melanomas have a notched or ragged border. \n Colours \u2013 melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours. \n Diameter \u2013 melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter. \n Enlargement or elevation \u2013 a mole that changes size over time\u00a0is more likely to be a melanoma. \n \n Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly\u00a0appear on the\u00a0back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail. \n In rare cases, melanoma can develop in\u00a0the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be\u00a0diagnosed during a routine eye examination. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Melanoma symptoms .", "causes": "Most skin cancer is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light damaging the DNA in skin cells. The main source of UV light is sunlight. \n Sunlight contains 3 types of UV light: \n \n ultraviolet A (UVA) \n ultraviolet B (UVB) \n ultraviolet C (UVC) \n \n UVC is filtered out by the Earth's atmosphere, but UVA and UVB damage skin over time, making it more likely for skin cancers to develop. UVB is thought to be the main cause of skin cancer. \n Artificial sources of light, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, also increase your risk of developing skin cancer. \n Repeated  sunburn , either by the sun or artificial sources of light, increases the risk of melanoma in people of all ages. \n Moles \n You\u00a0are at an increased\u00a0risk of melanoma if you have\u00a0lots of\u00a0moles\u00a0on your body, especially if they are large\u00a0(over 5mm) or unusually shaped. \n Having just one unusually shaped or very large mole increases your risk of melanoma by 60%. \n For this reason, it's important to monitor moles for changes and avoid exposing them to the sun. \n Family history \n Research suggests that if you have 2 or more close relatives who have had non-melanoma skin cancer, your chances of developing the condition may be increased. \n Increased risk \n Certain\u00a0things\u00a0are believed to increase your chances of developing all types of skin cancer, including: \n \n pale skin that does not tan easily \n red or blonde hair \n blue eyes \n older age \n a large number of freckles \n an area of skin previously damaged by burning or radiotherapy treatment \n a condition that suppresses your immune system \u2013 such as  HIV  \n medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants) \u2013 commonly used after organ transplants \n exposure to certain chemicals \u2013 such as creosote and arsenic \n a previous diagnosis of skin cancer \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Melanoma risks and causes .", "treatment": "Melanoma stages \n Health professionals use a staging system to describe how far melanoma has grown into the skin (the thickness) and whether it has spread. The type of treatment you receive will depend on what stage the melanoma has reached. \n The melanoma stages can be described as: \n \n Stage 0 \u2013 the melanoma is on the surface of the skin. \u00a0 \n Stage 1A \u2013 the melanoma is less than 1mm thick. \n Stage 1B \u2013 the melanoma is 1-2mm thick, or the melanoma is less than 1mm thick and the surface of the skin is broken (ulcerated) or its cells are dividing faster than usual (mitotic activity). \n Stage 2A \u2013 the melanoma is 2-4mm thick, or the melanoma is 1-2mm thick and is ulcerated. \n Stage 2B \u2013 the melanoma is thicker than 4mm, or the melanoma is 2-4mm thick and ulcerated. \n Stage 2C \u2013 the melanoma is thicker than 4mm and ulcerated. \n Stage 3A \u2013 the melanoma has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, but they are not enlarged; the melanoma is not ulcerated and has not spread further. \n Stage 3B \u2013 the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1\u00a0to 3 nearby lymph nodes but they are not enlarged, or the melanoma is not ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or the melanoma has spread to small areas of skin or lymphatic channels, but not to nearby lymph nodes. \n Stage 3C \u2013 the melanoma is ulcerated and has spread into 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes and they are enlarged, or\u00a0the melanoma has spread into 4 or more lymph nodes nearby. \n Stage 4 \u2013 the melanoma cells have spread to other areas of the body, such as the lungs, brain or other parts of the skin. \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Treating melanoma  \n Cancer Research UK:  Stages of melanoma  \n Macmillan:  Melanoma  \n \n Stage 1 melanoma \n Treating stage 1 melanoma will involve surgically removing the melanoma and a small area of skin around it \u2013 this is known as surgical excision. \n Surgical excision\u00a0is usually\u00a0carried out\u00a0under  local anaesthetic . This means you will be awake but the area around the melanoma will be numbed, so you won't feel pain. In some cases,  general anaesthetic  is used, which means you will be asleep during the procedure. \n If a surgical excision is likely to leave a significant scar, it may be done in combination with a skin graft. A skin graft involves removing a patch of healthy skin, usually\u00a0taken from a part of your body where scarring cannot be seen, such as your back. It is then connected, or grafted, to the affected area. Skin grafts or flaps are used when the area of skin being removed is too big to close using a direct method. \n Once the melanoma has been removed, there is little possibility it will return and no further treatment should be required. You will probably be asked to come for follow-up appointments before being discharged.\u00a0 \n Stage 2 and 3 melanoma \n As with stage\u00a01 melanomas, any affected areas of skin will be removed.\u00a0The remaining skin is\u00a0either closed directly, or a skin graft or flap may be\u00a0carried out\u00a0if necessary. \n Sentinel node biopsy \n Sentinel node biopsy, which is not a mandatory procedure, will be discussed with you. If you decide to go ahead\u00a0with the procedure\u00a0and the results show no spread to nearby lymph nodes, it is unlikely you will have further problems with this melanoma. \n If the test confirms melanoma has spread to nearby nodes, your specialist will discuss with you whether further surgery is required. Additional surgery involves removing the remaining nodes, known as a completion lymph node\u00a0dissection or completion lymphadenectomy. \n Lymph nodes \n If the melanoma has spread to nearby lymph nodes, you may need further surgery to remove them. Your doctor will\u00a0have felt a lump in your lymph nodes and\u00a0the diagnosis of melanoma is usually confirmed using a needle biopsy (fine needle aspiration).\u00a0Removing the affected nodes requires a procedure called a block dissection, performed under general anaesthetic. \n While the surgeon will try to ensure\u00a0the rest of your lymphatic system can function normally, there is a risk that the removal of lymph nodes will disrupt the lymphatic system, leading to a build-up of fluids in your limbs. This is known as  lymphoedema . \n Follow-up \n Once the melanoma has been removed, you will need follow-up appointments to see how you are recovering and to watch for any sign of the melanoma returning. \n You may be offered treatment to try to prevent the melanoma\u00a0returning. This is called adjuvant treatment. There is not much evidence that adjuvant treatment helps prevent melanoma from coming back, so this is only offered as part of a clinical trial. \n Stage 4 melanoma \n It may not be possible to cure melanoma if it has: \n \n been\u00a0diagnosed at its most advanced stage \n spread to another part of your body (metastasis) \n come back in another part of your body after treatment (recurrent cancer) \n \n Treatment is available and given in the hope that it can slow the cancer's growth, reduce any symptoms you may have and possibly extend your life expectancy. \n You may be able to have surgery to remove other melanomas that have occurred away from the original site. \n You may also be able to have other treatments to help with symptoms. These include: \n \n radiotherapy\u00a0 \n drug treatments \n \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0may be used after an operation to remove your lymph nodes, and can also be used to help relieve the symptoms of advanced melanoma. \n Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is given at the hospital as a series of 10-15 minute daily sessions, with a rest period over the weekend. \n The side effects of radiotherapy include: \n \n tiredness \n nausea \n loss of appetite \n hair loss \n sore skin \n \n Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe, so let them know about any that you experience. After treatment has finished, the side effects of radiotherapy should gradually reduce. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Radiotherapy for melanoma . \n \n Drug treatment \n In recent years there have been major advancements in treating melanoma. The medications used to treat melanoma are changing as new formulations are being introduced into clinics. \n The medications currently being used include: \n \n vemurafenib \n ipilimumab \n nivolumab \n \n However, not everyone is suitable for these drugs. Your specialist will discuss an appropriate treatment with you, and many people are entered into clinical trials (see clinical trials,\u00a0below). \n Some of the available medications are discussed below. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to kill the cancer.\u00a0It is normally used to treat melanoma that has spread to parts of the body and is mainly given to help relieve symptoms of advanced melanoma. \n Several different chemotherapy drugs are used to treat melanoma and are occasionally given in combination. The drugs most commonly used for melanoma are dacarbazine and temozolomide. However, many different types of drugs can be used. Your specialist can discuss with you which drugs are the most suitable. \n Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. Dacarbazine is given through a drip and temozolomide is given in tablet-form. Chemotherapy sessions are usually given once every 3 to 4 weeks, with gaps between treatment intended to give your body and blood time to recover. \n The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on the rest of the body. Side effects include infection, nausea and vomiting, tiredness and sore mouth. Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe. \n Electrochemotherapy \n Electrochemotherapy is a possible treatment for melanoma. It may be considered if: \n \n surgery isn't suitable or hasn't worked \n radiotherapy and chemotherapy haven't worked \n \n The procedure involves giving chemotherapy intravenously (directly into a vein).\u00a0Short, powerful pulses of electricity are then directed to the tumour using electrodes. \n These electrical pulses allow the medicine to enter the tumour cells more effectively and cause more damage to the tumour.\u00a0The procedure\u00a0is usually\u00a0carried out using general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) but some people may\u00a0be able to have\u00a0local anaesthetic\u00a0(where you're awake but the area is numbed). \n Depending on how many tumours need to be treated, the procedure can take up to an hour to complete. The main side effect is some pain where the electrode was used, which can last for a few days and may require painkillers. \n It usually takes around 6 weeks for results to appear and the procedure usually needs to be repeated. \n Your specialist can give you more detailed information about this treatment option. \n Read the NICE (2013) guidelines on  Electrochemotherapy for metastases in the skin   . \n Immunotherapy \n Immunotherapy uses drugs (often derived from substances that occur naturally in the body) that encourage your body's immune system to work against the melanoma. Two such treatments in regular use for melanoma are\u00a0interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. Both are given as an injection (into the blood, under the skin, or into lumps of melanoma). \n Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as chills, a high temperature, joint pain and fatigue. \n Vaccines \n There is ongoing research\u00a0into producing a vaccine for melanoma, either to treat advanced melanoma or to be used\u00a0after surgery in patients who have a high risk of the melanoma coming back. \n Vaccines are designed to focus the body\u2019s immune system so it recognises the melanoma and can work against it. Vaccines are usually given as an injection under the skin every few weeks, often over a period of months. \n As more research is needed into vaccines, they are only given as part of a clinical trial. \n Monoclonal antibodies \n Our immune systems make antibodies all the time, usually as a way of controlling infections. They are substances that recognise something which doesn\u2019t belong in the body and help to destroy it. Antibodies can be produced in the laboratory and can be made to recognise and lock onto specific targets, either in the cancer or in specific parts of the body. \n Antibodies produced in the laboratory are usually called monoclonal antibodies. \n Ipilimumab \n Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been licensed for use in the UK since 2011. It works like an accelerator for the immune system, allowing the body to work against all sorts of conditions, including cancer. \n In December 2012, NICE recommended ipilimumab as a possible treatment for people with previously treated advanced melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed. \n Signalling inhibitors \n Signalling inhibitors are drugs that work by disrupting the messages (signals) a cancer uses to co-ordinate its growth. There are hundreds of these signals, and it is difficult to know which ones need to be blocked. Most of the signals have short, technical names. Two that are of current interest in relation to melanoma are BRAF and MEK. \n There are drugs available that can interfere with these signals, but most are currently only widely available as part of clinical trials. \n NICE recommends a signalling inhibitor called vemurafenib as a possible treatment for melanoma that has spread or cannot be surgically removed. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Biological therapy for melanoma . \n Cancer Research UK:  Chemotherapy for melanoma . \n \n Clinical trials \n All new treatment for cancer (and other diseases) is first given to patients in a clinical trial. \n A clinical trial or study is an extremely rigorous way of testing a drug on people. Patients are monitored for any effects of the drug on the cancer, as well as side effects. Many people with melanoma are offered entry into clinical trials, but some people are suspicious of the process. \n There are a few key things to know about clinical trials: \n \n Overall, patients in clinical trials do better than those on routine treatment, even when receiving a drug that would be given routinely. \n All clinical trials are highly regulated. \n All new treatments will first become available through clinical trials. \n Even where a new drug fails to offer any benefits over existing treatment, the knowledge that we gain from the trial is valuable for future patients. \n \n If you are asked to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Melanoma research . \n \n Deciding against treatment for Stage 4 melanoma \n Many of the treatments described above have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life. You may decide against having treatment if it is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy, or if you do not have symptoms causing you pain or discomfort. \n This is entirely your decision and your healthcare team will respect it. If you decide not to receive treatment, pain relief and nursing care will be made available when you need it. This is called  palliative care . \n Want to know more? \n \n  Accessing palliative care . \n Cancer Research UK:  Advanced melanoma (Stage 4) .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "A diagnosis of melanoma will usually begin with an examination of your skin.

It's important\u00a0to monitor your moles and return to your GP if you notice any changes. Taking photos to document any changes will help with diagnosis. \n Seeing a specialist \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of malignant melanoma and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected\u00a0malignant melanoma, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n You will be referred to a dermatology clinic or hospital\u00a0for further testing if melanoma is suspected. You should see a specialist within two weeks of seeing your GP. \n The\u00a0dermatologist\u00a0or plastic surgeon will examine the mole and the rest of your skin. They may\u00a0also remove the mole and send it for testing ( biopsy ) to\u00a0check whether the mole is cancerous. A biopsy is usually carried out under  local anaesthetic ,\u00a0meaning the area around the mole will be numbed and you won't feel any pain. \n If cancer is confirmed, you will usually need a further operation, most often carried out by a plastic surgeon, to remove a wider area\u00a0of skin. \n Further tests \n Further tests will be carried out if there is a concern the cancer has spread into other organs, bones or your bloodstream. \n Sentinel lymph node biopsy \n If melanoma spreads, it will usually begin spreading through channels in the skin (called lymphatics) to the nearest group of glands (called lymph nodes).\u00a0Lymph nodes\u00a0are part of the body\u2019s immune system, helping to remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body. \n Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a test to determine whether microscopic amounts of melanoma (less than would show up on any X-ray or scan) might have spread to the lymph nodes. It is usually carried out by a specialist plastic surgeon, while you are under  general anaesthetic . \n A combination of blue dye and a weak radioactive chemical is injected around your scar. This is usually done just before the wider\u00a0area\u00a0of skin is removed. The solution follows the same channels in the skin as any melanoma. \n The first lymph node this reaches\u00a0is known as\u00a0the \u201csentinel\u201d lymph node. The surgeon can\u00a0locate and remove the sentinel node, leaving the others intact. The node is then examined for microscopic specks of melanoma\u00a0(this process can take several weeks). \n If the sentinel lymph node is clear of melanoma, it's extremely unlikely that any other lymph nodes are affected. This can be reassuring\u00a0because if melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, it's more likely to spread elsewhere. \n If the sentinel lymph node contains melanoma, there is a risk that other lymph nodes in the same group will contain melanoma. \n Your surgeon should discuss the pros and cons of having a sentinel lymph node biopsy before you agree to the procedure. Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not cure melanoma, but\u00a0is used to investigate the outlook of your condition. \n An operation to remove the remaining lymph nodes in the group\u00a0may be recommended. This is known as a completion lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy. \n Other tests you may have include: \n \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \n a  magnetic resonance imaging\u00a0(MRI) scan  \n a positron emission tomography (PET) scan \n  blood tests  \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Melanoma tests . \n Cancer Research UK:  Further tests for melanoma ."},

Certain glands become inflamed, which reduces the production of tears and saliva, causing the main symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, which are\u00a0dry eyes and  dry mouth . \n In women (who are most commonly affected), the glands that keep the vagina moist can also be affected, leading to vaginal dryness. \n Read\u00a0more about the\u00a0 symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome  \n What causes Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome? \n Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue. \n In Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands,\u00a0and other secretory glands throughout the body. \n The reasons for this remains unknown, but research suggests that it's triggered by a combination of genetic, environmental and, possibly, hormonal factors. \n Some people are thought to be more vulnerable to the syndrome when they're born and that certain events, such an infection, can trigger the problems with the immune system. \n Read more about the  causes of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome  \n Healthcare professionals classify Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome as being either: \n \n primary \u2013 when the syndrome develops by itself and not as the result of another condition \n secondary \u2013 when the syndrome develops in combination with another autoimmune disorder, such as\u00a0 lupus  or  rheumatoid arthritis  \n \n Diagnosing\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \n Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, because\u00a0it has similar symptoms to other conditions and there is no single test for it. \n Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and carry out a test to see how dry your mouth and eyes are. \n Read more about  diagnosing Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome  \n Treating Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \n There is no cure for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but treatments can help control symptoms. \n Dry eyes and mouth can usually be\u00a0helped with artificial tears and saliva. \n It's important to maintain good eye and mouth hygiene, because your risk of developing an infection is greater. Taking care of your eyes and mouth can help prevent problems such as\u00a0corneal ulcers and  tooth decay . \n In severe cases, medication or surgery may be recommended. \n Read more about  treating Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome  \n Complications of\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \n Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can sometimes lead to complications. For example, your eyesight could be permanently damaged if the reduced tear production isn't treated. \n Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome also increases your risk of developing  non-Hodgkin lymphoma , which is\u00a0a cancer of the lymph glands. However, the chances\u00a0are still low, at around 5%. \n Women with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome have an increased risk of having children with a temporary \"lupus\" rash\u00a0or heart abnormalities. Any pregnancy will be closely monitored for potential problems. \n Read more about the\u00a0 complications of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome  \n Who's affected by\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome? \n Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome most commonly affects people aged 40-60, with women accounting for about 90% of cases. \n It\u2019s difficult to know exactly how many people are affected by the syndrome because many don't see their GP about their symptoms. \n However,  Arthritis Research UK  estimates that there may be up to half a million people in the UK who have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. \n Information about you \n If you have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register", "symptoms": "The most commonly reported symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome are a dry mouth and eyes, which can lead to other associated symptoms. \n However, these symptoms can be common in old age, and most people with\u00a0dry eyes or a dry mouth do not have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. \n Many women also experience vaginal dryness, which can make sex painful. \n Associated symptoms of dry mouth \n A\u00a0 dry mouth  can lead to: \n \n  tooth decay \u00a0and  gum disease  \n dry\u00a0 cough  \n difficulty swallowing and chewing \n hoarse voice \n difficulty speaking \n swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and ears) \n repeated fungal infections in the mouth ( oral thrush ) \u2013 symptoms of which can include a coated or white tongue \n \n Associated symptoms of dry eyes \n Dry eyes can lead to: \n \n burning or stinging eyes \n itchy eyes \n a feeling that there's grit in your eyes \n irritated and swollen eyelids \n sensitivity to light (photophobia) \n tired eyes \n mucus\u00a0discharge from your eyes \n \n These symptoms can get worse when you're: \n \n in a windy or smoky environment \n in an air-conditioned building \n travelling on aeroplane \n \n Other symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \n In more serious cases of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the immune system can attack other parts of the body, causing symptoms and conditions such as: \n \n dry skin \n tiredness and fatigue \u2013 which are common and can lead to total exhaustion \n muscle pain \n joint pain, stiffness and swelling \n vasculitis\u00a0(inflammation of blood vessels) \n difficulty concentrating, remembering and reasoning", "causes": "It's not known exactly what causes Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but it's thought to be linked to a problem with the immune system. \n The immune system \n Your immune system usually helps protect the body from infection and illness by making antibodies. Antibodies attack bacteria and viruses, which help stop you from becoming ill. \n An autoimmune condition causes your immune system to react abnormally. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as bacteria, the antibodies start attacking your body's healthy cells and tissue. \n In Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the parts of the body usually affected are the tear, saliva and vaginal glands, which are collectively known as the exocrine glands. \n The antibodies damage the exocrine glands so they can no longer function normally. There's some evidence that the immune system also damages the nerves that control these glands, which further reduces their effectiveness. \n The immune system can go on to damage other parts of the body, such as muscles, joints, blood vessels, nerves and, less commonly, organs. \n Possible triggers for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \n Primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome \n Most researchers believe that primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. \n Certain people are born with specific genes that make them more vulnerable to a faulty immune system. Then, many years later, an environmental factor, possibly a common virus, triggers the immune system to stop working properly. \n The female hormone oestrogen also seems to play\u00a0a role. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome mostly occurs in women, and symptoms usually start around the time of the  menopause , when oestrogen levels begin to fall. Falling oestrogen levels can contribute to dryness, and this dryness\u00a0could make the\u00a0condition more noticeable. \n Secondary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome \n Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as  rheumatoid arthritis  or  lupus . This is known as secondary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. \n The exocrine glands \n Your saliva and tear glands play a vital role in protecting your mouth and eyes, which is why the symptoms of\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be widespread and troublesome. \n The importance of tears \n We usually only notice our tears when we cry, but our eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, known as a tear film. \n Tears are made up of a mix of water, proteins, fats, mucus and infection-fighting cells. Tears serve several important functions. They: \n \n lubricate the eye \n keep the eye clean and free of dust \n protect the eye against infection \n help stabilise your vision \n \n The importance of saliva \n Saliva also serves several important functions, including: \n \n keeping the mouth and throat naturally lubricated \n aiding digestion by moistening food and containing enzymes that can break down certain starches \n acting as a natural disinfectant (saliva contains antibodies, enzymes and proteins that protect against some common bacterial and fungal infections)", "treatment": "There's no cure for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but treatments help relieve symptoms such as eye and mouth dryness. \n Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome affects everyone in different ways, so your treatment plan will be\u00a0tailored to suit you. \n Eye care \n Artificial tears \n Mild to moderate cases of dry eye can usually be successfully treated with eye drops containing \"artificial tears\" \u2013 a liquid that mimics tears. These eye drops are available from a pharmacist, without a prescription. \n There are many different types of eye drops, so you can try different brands to find the one that works best for you. If you're using eye drops regularly (more than three times a day), you should use one that doesn't contain\u00a0preservatives. This is because there's evidence that over-exposure to preservatives can damage the surface of the eye. \n A short-term dose of eye drops containing  corticosteroids  may be recommended if your eyes become irritated. However,\u00a0long-term corticosteroid use isn't recommended because they can cause serious side effects. \n To minimise the chance of experiencing side effects from corticosteroids, you'll be prescribed the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. \n Moisture chamber spectacles \n Wearing glasses reduces tear evaporation by up to 30%, and this effect can be maximised by wearing specially-made glasses called moisture chamber spectacles. These wrap around your eyes like goggles and help retain moisture and protect the eyes from irritants. \n Some people used to be embarrassed to\u00a0wear them, but modern designs look like sports glasses. \n Punctal plugs \n Punctual occlusion is a widely-used technique that seals the tear ducts (into which the tears drain) with small plugs. This should help keep\u00a0the eye better protected by tears. \n Temporary plugs made of silicone are usually used first to see if they help. If it does, more permanent plugs can be used. \n Mouth care \n Looking after your mouth \n A\u00a0number of techniques can be used to keep your mouth lubricated, including: \n \n maintaining good oral hygiene to\u00a0 prevent tooth decay  and\u00a0 gum disease  \n increasing your fluid intake \n using sugar-free chewing gum to stimulate saliva production \n sucking ice cubes to help lubricate your mouth and reduce dryness \n regularly using mouth rinses to soothe\u00a0your mouth and protect it against infection \n \n If you smoke, you should try to quit. Smoking irritates the mouth and increases the rate at which saliva evaporates. \n Read more about\u00a0 how to stop smoking  \n Saliva substitutes \n There are a number of saliva substitute products that can help lubricate your mouth. However, they don't replicate the role of\u00a0saliva in preventing infection, so you'll still need to maintain excellent oral hygiene. \n Saliva substitutes are available as a spray, lozenge (medicated sweet), gel, or gum. Your GP or pharmacist can tell you which product is most suitable for you. \n Medication for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \n Pilocarpine \n The medicine pilocarpine is often used to treat the  symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth . Pilocarpine stimulates the glands to produce more saliva and tears. \n Side effects of pilocarpine include: \n \n  hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)  \n nausea \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n heartburn \n abdominal (stomach) pain \n an increased need to go to the toilet \n \n For some people, the side effects of pilocarpine are mild. Others find that the side effects outweigh the benefits. \n Don't take pilocarpine if you have\u00a0 asthma  or  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. \n Hydroxychloroquine \n Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to slow down the immune system's attack on the tear and saliva glands. It can also help reduce any associated symptoms of muscle pain, joint pain and stiffness. \n You'll need to take hydroxychloroquine for several weeks before you notice any improvements, and it could be six months before you experience the full benefit of the treatment. \n Side effects are uncommon and usually mild. They include: \n \n nausea \n skin rash \n loss of appetite \n stomach cramps \n vomiting \n \n In very rare cases, hydroxychloroquine can damage the retina, affecting vision. You'll probably be asked to attend an eye examination so that your retina can be checked before you start treatment. Regular eye examinations (usually at least once a year) are also recommended after you begin treatment. \n Hydroxychloroquine shouldn't be used by breastfeeding women. \n Treating other symptoms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \n Dry skin \n Several soaps and creams are specifically designed for people with dry skin. Your pharmacist or GP can advise you. \n Vaginal dryness \n Vaginal dryness can be treated using a lubricant. Some women also use oestrogen creams or  hormone replacement therapy (HRT) . \n Muscle and joint pains \n Muscle and joint pains can be treated with an over-the-counter  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) , such as  ibuprofen . If this doesn't work, see your GP, as stronger NSAIDs are available on prescription. \n NSAIDs can increase your risk of developing  stomach ulcers  and internal bleeding, particularly if they're taken on a long-term basis. \n If you find swallowing NSAIDs difficult because of your dry mouth, you can try an NSAID cream that's rubbed into affected joints. \n NSAIDs aren't recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, or for people with pre-existing risk factors for cardiovascular or kidney conditions. \n General advice \n These\u00a0simple tips can help prevent many of the problems associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome: \n \n have a dental check-up every six months \n practise good dental hygiene \u2013 brushing, flossing and using mouthwash regularly \n avoid eating too many sweet foods \n avoid strong and perfumed soaps \u2013 use special creams and soaps from your pharmacist \n avoid dry environments, such as air-conditioned offices, whenever possible \n avoid drinking too much\u00a0 alcohol", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other health conditions. \n You may see different health professionals\u00a0for your\u00a0different symptoms, such as a dentist for a\u00a0 dry mouth , an optician for\u00a0dry eyes and a gynaecologist for\u00a0a\u00a0dry vagina, which can sometimes make it difficult to reach a firm diagnosis. \n See\u00a0your GP if you experience any symptoms of dryness, particularly of your eyes and mouth. \n Screening questions \n Experts in the field have come up with a series of screening questions, which may be useful if you're worried you may have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. \n If you answer \"yes\" to most of the questions below, you may have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and will probably be advised to have further tests. \n \n Have you had daily, persistent, troublesome dry eyes for more than three months? \n Do you keep having a sensation of grit in your eye? \n Do you need to use eye drops containing tear substitutes more than three times a day? \n Have you had a daily feeling of dry mouth for more than three months? \n Do you keep getting swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and your ears)? \n Do you frequently drink liquids to help you swallow food? \n \n Further testing \n Tests used to diagnose\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome include: \n \n tear break-up time and Schirmer tests \n a lip biopsy \n blood tests \n salivary flow rate \n \n These are explained below. \n Tear break-up time and Schirmer tests \n Tear break-up time and Schirmer tests are usually carried out by an ophthalmologist (a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions). \n The tear break-up time test measures how effective your tear glands are.\u00a0A non-toxic dye is dropped onto the surface of your eye and the\u00a0colour of the dye allows the ophthalmologist to see how well your tear film is functioning and how long it takes for your tears to evaporate. \n This test is also carried out\u00a0using a slit lamp. A slit lamp is a low-power microscope with a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine in a\u00a0narrow beam. The specialist will use the slit lamp to examine your tear glands more closely. \n In the Schirmer test, small strips of blotting paper are placed into your lower eyelid. After five minutes, the strips are removed to see how much of the paper is soaked with tears. \n Lip biopsy \n During a lip  biopsy , a small tissue\u00a0sample\u00a0is removed from your inner lip and examined under a microscope. A  local anaesthetic \u00a0is\u00a0injected into\u00a0the inner surface of your lower lip to numb the area, before a small cut is made to remove a few of your minor salivary glands. \n Clusters of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the tissue can indicate Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. \n Blood tests \n  Blood tests \u00a0are carried out to look for antibodies known as anti-Ro and anti-La (or SS-A and SS-B), which are produced when the immune system has been affected by Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. \n These antibodies are only present in about 60% of people with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, so it's possible to have a negative blood test result and still have the condition. \n Salivary flow rate \n A salivary flow rate test measures how much saliva your glands produce. \n You'll usually be asked to spit as much saliva as you can into a cup\u00a0over a five-minute period. The amount of saliva is then weighed or measured. An unusually low flow rate can indicate Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Sinusitis", "introduction": "Sinusitis is a common condition in which the lining of the sinuses becomes inflamed. It's usually caused by a viral infection and often improves within two or three weeks. \n The\u00a0sinuses are small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead. \n The mucus produced by your sinuses usually drains into your nose through small channels. In sinusitis, these channels become blocked because the sinus linings are inflamed (swollen). \n Signs and symptoms \n Sinusitis usually occurs after an upper respiratory tract\u00a0infection, such as a\u00a0 cold . If you have a\u00a0persistent cold and develop the symptoms below, you may have sinusitis. \n Symptoms of sinusitis\u00a0include: \n \n a green or yellow\u00a0discharge from your nose \n a blocked nose \n pain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead \n a\u00a0sinus headache \n a high temperature (fever) of\u00a038C (100.4F) or more \n toothache \n a reduced sense of smell \n bad breath (halitosis) \n \n Children with sinusitis may be irritable, breathe through their mouth, and have difficulty feeding. Their speech may also sound nasal (as though they have a stuffy cold). \n The symptoms\u00a0of sinusitis often clear up within a few weeks (acute sinusitis), although occasionally they\u00a0can last\u00a0three months or more (chronic sinusitis). \n When to see your GP \n If your symptoms are mild and getting better, you don't usually need to see your GP and can look after yourself at home. \n See your GP if: \n \n your symptoms are severe or getting worse \n your symptoms haven't started to improve after around 7-10 days \n you experience episodes of sinusitis frequently \n \n Your GP will usually be able to diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms and by examining the\u00a0inside of your nose. \n If you have severe or recurrent sinusitis, they may refer you\u00a0to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further assessment. \n How\u00a0sinusitis is treated \n Most\u00a0people with sinusitis will feel better within two or three weeks and can look after themselves at home. \n You can help relieve your symptoms by: \n \n taking over-the-counter painkillers such as\u00a0paracetamol or\u00a0 ibuprofen  \n using nasal\u00a0 decongestants \u00a0\u2013 these shouldn't be used for more than a week, as this might make things worse \n holding warm packs to your face \n regularly cleaning the inside of your nose with a saline solution\u00a0\u2013 you can make this at home yourself or use\u00a0sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy \n \n If your symptoms aren't improving or are getting worse, your GP may prescribe  antibiotics  or  corticosteroid  spray or drops to see if they help. \n If your symptoms don't\u00a0get better\u00a0after trying these treatments, you may be referred to an ENT specialist for surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses. \n Read more about  treating sinusitis  \n What causes sinusitis? \n Sinusitis is usually the result of a\u00a0cold or\u00a0 flu \u00a0virus spreading to the sinuses from the upper airways. Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses. \n An infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed. \n It's not clear exactly what causes sinusitis to become chronic (long-lasting), but it has been associated with: \n \n  allergies \u00a0and related conditions,\u00a0including allergic rhinitis,  asthma  and  hay fever  \n nasal polyps (growths inside the nose) \n smoking \n a weakened immune system \n \n Making sure underlying conditions such as allergies and asthma are well controlled may improve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Most people with sinusitis don't need to see their GP. The condition is normally caused by a viral infection that clears up on its own. \n Your symptoms will usually pass within two or three weeks (acute sinusitis) and you can look after yourself at home. \n If the condition is severe, gets worse, or doesn't improve (chronic sinusitis), you may need additional treatment from your GP or a hospital specialist.\u00a0This can be difficult to treat and it may be\u00a0several months before you're feeling better. \n Looking after yourself at home \n If your symptoms are mild and have\u00a0lasted less than a week or so, you can usually take care of yourself without seeing your GP. \n The following tips may help you feel better until you recover: \n \n Take over-the-counter painkillers such as  paracetamol  and  ibuprofen \u00a0to relieve a high temperature and pain\u00a0\u2013 check the leaflet that comes with your medication first to check it's suitable, and never give aspirin to\u00a0children under 16 years of age. \n Use\u00a0over-the-counter  decongestant  nasal sprays\u00a0or drops to help unblock your\u00a0nose and\u00a0allow you to breathe more easily\u00a0\u2013 these shouldn't be used for more than a week at a time. \n Apply warm packs to your face to soothe your pain and help mucus drain from your sinuses. \n Regularly clean the inside of your nose with a salt water solution to help\u00a0unblock your nose and reduce nasal discharge. \n \n Cleaning inside your nose \n You can clean the inside of your nose using either a home-made salt water solution or a solution made with sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy. \n To make the solution at home, mix a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into a pint of boiled water that has been left to cool. To rinse your nose: \n \n wash and dry your hands \n stand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it \n sniff the water into one nostril at a time \n \n Repeat these steps until your nose feels more comfortable (you may not need to use all of the solution). You should make a fresh solution each day. Don't re-use a solution made the day before. \n Special devices you can use instead of your hand are also available for pharmacies. If you choose to use one of these, make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions about using and cleaning it. \n Treatments from your\u00a0GP \n See your GP if your symptoms are severe, don't start to improve\u00a0within 7 to 10 days, or are getting worse. They may recommend\u00a0additional treatment with\u00a0 corticosteroid \u00a0drops or sprays, or  antibiotics . \n If these treatments don't help, you GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for an assessment and to discuss whether surgery is a suitable option. \n Corticosteroid drops or sprays \n Corticosteroids,\u00a0also known as\u00a0steroids, are a group of medications that can help to reduce inflammation. \n If you have persistent symptoms of sinusitis, your GP may prescribe steroid nasal drops or sprays\u00a0to help reduce the swelling in your sinuses. These may need to be used for several months. \n Possible side effects include nasal irritation, a\u00a0 sore throat  and  nosebleeds . \n Antibiotics \n If your GP thinks your sinuses may be infected with bacteria, they will prescribe a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules to treat the infection. \n You'll usually need to take these for\u00a0a week, although sometimes a longer course may be prescribed. \n Possible side effects of antibiotics include feeling and being sick,  diarrhoea  and  abdominal (tummy) pain . \n Surgery \n If your symptoms don't improve despite trying the treatments mentioned above, a type of surgery called functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) may be recommended. This is a procedure to improve the drainage of mucus from your sinuses. \n FESS\u00a0is usually carried out under  general anaesthetic . During the procedure, the surgeon will insert an endoscope into your nose. This is a thin tube with a lens at one end that magnifies the inside of your nose. It will allow the surgeon to see the opening of your sinuses and insert small surgical instruments. \n The surgeon will then either: \n \n remove any tissues, such as\u00a0nasal polyps (growths), that are blocking the affected sinus \n inflate a tiny balloon in the drainage passages from your sinuses to widen them, before the balloon\u00a0is deflated and removed (this is known as a balloon catheter dilation) \n \n Potential side effects and risks of these procedures include temporary discomfort and crusting inside the nose, bleeding from the nose and infection. Make sure you discuss the risks with your surgeon beforehand. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also provides information about  balloon catheter dilation for chronic sinusitis .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP can usually diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms. \n Sinusitis is nearly always caused by a viral infection, such as the\u00a0 common cold  or  flu , and is diagnosed based on the presence of: \n \n nasal blockage or runny nose with facial pain, and/or \n a reduction or loss of sense of smell \n \n Loss of smell is more common and facial pain less common\u00a0in chronic (persistent) sinusitis. \n Referral to a specialist \n If your sinusitis is severe or keeps coming back,\u00a0your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist who will carry out tests to determine the underlying cause. \n You may have\u00a0an\u00a0 X-ray  or\u00a0 CT scan \u00a0to\u00a0find out\u00a0the cause of your sinusitis (a\u00a0series of X-rays are taken for a CT scan, to produce a detailed picture of your sinuses)."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Shingles", "introduction": "Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it. It's caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox. \n It's estimated that around one in every four people will have at least one episode of shingles during their life. \n \u00a0 \n Symptoms of shingles \n The main symptom of shingles\u00a0is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy  blisters ,\u00a0similar in appearance to  chickenpox .\u00a0New blisters may appear for up to a week, but a few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out. \n Scabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring. \n The pain may be\u00a0a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe.\u00a0You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender. \n In some cases, shingles may cause some early symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash first appears. These early symptoms can include: \n \n a\u00a0 headache  \n burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area \n a feeling of being generally unwell \n a high temperature (fever) \n \n An episode of shingles typically lasts around two to four weeks. It usually\u00a0affects a specific area on\u00a0one side of the body and doesn't cross over the midline of the body (an imaginary line running from between your eyes down past the belly button). \n Any part of your body can be affected, including your face and eyes, but\u00a0the chest and abdomen (tummy) are the most common areas. \n When to seek medical advice \n Shingles isn't usually serious, but see your GP as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms.\u00a0They'll usually be able to diagnose shingles based on your symptoms and the appearance of the rash. \n Early treatment may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and the risk of developing complications. \n Referral to hospital \n It's uncommon for someone with shingles to be referred to hospital, but your GP may consider seeking specialist advice if: \n \n they suspect\u00a0a\u00a0 complication of shingles , such as\u00a0 meningitis  or\u00a0encephalitis \n shingles is affecting one of your eyes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0there's a risk\u00a0you could\u00a0develop permanent vision problems if the condition isn't treated quickly \n a diagnosis isn't certain \n you have an unusually persistent case of shingles that's not responding to treatment \n you've been diagnosed with the condition more than twice \n you're pregnant \n you have a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 particularly in severe cases or cases affecting children \n \n Causes of shingles \n Most people have\u00a0 chickenpox  in childhood, but after the illness has gone, the varicella-zoster virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nervous system. The immune system keeps the virus in check, but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles. \n It's possible to have shingles more than once, but it's very rare to get it more than twice.\u00a0 \n It's not known exactly why the shingles virus is reactivated at a later stage in life, but most cases are thought to be caused by\u00a0having lowered immunity (protection against infections and diseases). \n This may be the result of: \n \n old age \u2013 as you age, your immunity may decrease, and\u00a0shingles most commonly occurs in people over 70 years old \n physical and emotional\u00a0stress \u2013 the chemicals released by your body when you're stressed can prevent your immune system working properly \n  HIV and AIDS \u00a0\u2013 people with HIV are much more likely to get shingles than the rest of the population because their immune system is weak \n recently having a bone marrow transplant\u00a0\u2013 the conditioning\u00a0you require before the transplant weakens your immune system \n recently having an organ transplant \u2013 you may need to take medication to suppress your immune system so\u00a0your body accepts the donated organ \n  chemotherapy  \u2013 chemotherapy medication, often used to treat  cancer , can temporarily weaken your immune system \n \n However, young people who appear otherwise healthy can also sometimes develop shingles. \n Is shingles contagious? \n It's not possible to catch shingles from someone with the condition or from someone with chickenpox. However, you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had\u00a0chickenpox before. \n The blisters that form contain live virus. If a person who has never had chickenpox makes\u00a0direct contact with an open blister or something with the fluid on it,\u00a0they can contract the virus and develop chickenpox. \n Preventing the spread of the virus \n If you have shingles, you're contagious until the last blister has dried and scabbed over. To help prevent the virus being passed on,\u00a0avoid sharing towels or flannels, swimming, or playing contact sports.\u00a0You should also avoid work or school if\u00a0your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and can't be covered. \n Chickenpox can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people. If you have shingles, avoid: \n \n women who are pregnant and haven't had chickenpox before as they could catch it from you, which may harm their unborn baby \n people who have a weak immune system, such as someone with HIV or AIDS \n babies less than one month old, unless it's your own baby, in which case your baby should have antibodies (proteins that fight infection) to protect them from the virus \n \n Treating shingles \n Although there's\u00a0no cure for shingles, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms until the condition resolves. Most cases of shingles last around two to four weeks. \n Treatment for shingles can include: \n \n covering the rash with clothing or a non-adherent (non-stick) dressing to reduce the risk of other people becoming infected with chickenpox - as it's very difficult to pass the virus on to someone else if the rash is covered \n painkilling medication, - such as  paracetamol ,  ibuprofen  or codeine \n antiviral medication to stop the virus multiplying -\u00a0although not everyone will need this \n \n Read more about  treating shingles  \n Complications of shingles \n Shingles can sometimes lead to complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia. This is where severe nerve pain lasts for several months or more after the rash has gone. \n Complications such as this are usually\u00a0in elderly people who have had the condition and those with a weakened immune system. \n Read more about the  complications of shingles  \n The shingles vaccine \n It's not always possible to prevent shingles, but a vaccine called Zostavax can reduce your chances of developing the condition. \n If you still develop shingles after having this vaccine, it may be milder and last for a shorter time than usual. \n This vaccine is now routinely offered on the NHS as a single injection to people\u00a0aged\u00a070 and 78.\u00a0 \n Read more about\u00a0 shingles vaccination \u00a0and\u00a0 who can have the shingles vaccine  \n Ophthalmic shingles \n Some cases of shingles can affect one of the eyes and are known as ophthalmic shingles. This occurs when the virus is reactivated in part of the trigeminal nerve,\u00a0a nerve that controls sensation and movement in your face. \n Symptoms can include: \n \n a rash over your forehead, nose and around your eye \n  conjunctivitis \u00a0\u2013 inflammation of your eye that causes it to become red and watery with a sticky coating on your eyelashes \n a\u00a0red eye \n problems with your vision", "symptoms": "An episode of shingles typically lasts around two to four weeks. The main symptoms are pain, followed by a rash. \n Any part of your body can be affected, including your face and eyes, although the chest and abdomen (tummy) are the most common areas where shingles develops. \n Early symptoms \n In some cases, shingles may cause some early (prodromal) symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash first appears. These early symptoms can include: \n \n a\u00a0 headache  \n burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area \n a feeling of being generally unwell \n a high temperature (fever) \n \n Not everyone will experience these prodromal symptoms. A high temperature is particularly uncommon. \n Pain \n Eventually, most people with shingles experience a localised \"band\" of pain in the affected area. \n The pain can be a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe. You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender. \n Pain is less common in young healthy people and is rare in children. It\u00a0usually starts a few days before the rash appears and can remain for a\u00a0few days or weeks after the rash has\u00a0healed. \n Rash \n The shingles rash usually appears on one side of your body and develops on the area of skin related to the affected nerve. \n Initially, the shingles rash appears as red blotches on your skin before developing into itchy\u00a0 blisters \u00a0similar in appearance to  chickenpox . \n New blisters may appear for up to a week, but a few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out. \n Scabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring. It usually takes two to four weeks for the rash to heal completely. \n When to seek\u00a0medical advice \n Shingles is not usually serious, but you should see your GP as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms. Early treatment may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and the risk of developing complications. \n You should also see your GP\u00a0if you\u00a0are pregnant or have a weakened immune system (the body's natural defence system) and you think you have been exposed to someone with chickenpox or shingles and haven't had chickenpox before.", "causes": "Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which is the virus that causes chickenpox. \n After you have had\u00a0 chickenpox , the varicella-zoster virus lies dormant (inactive) inside your body.

This will usually occur after about 10 to 14 days. \n Preventing the virus spreading \n If you have the shingles rash, do not share towels or flannels, go swimming, or play contact sports. This will help prevent the virus being passed on to someone who has not had chickenpox. \n You should also avoid work or school if\u00a0your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and cannot be covered. \n Chickenpox can be particularly dangerous for certain groups of people.

In many cases, shingles gets better within around two to four weeks. \n However, it's still important to see your GP as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms of shingles, as early treatment may help reduce the severity of the condition and the risk of\u00a0potential complications. \n Self-care \n If you develop the shingles rash, there are a number of things you can do to help relieve your symptoms, such as: \n \n keeping the rash as clean and dry as possible\u00a0\u2013 this will reduce the risk of the rash becoming infected with bacteria \n wearing loose-fitting clothing\u00a0\u2013 this may help you feel more comfortable \n not using topical (rub-on) antibiotics or adhesive dressings such as\u00a0plasters\u00a0\u2013 this can slow down the healing process \n using a non-adherent dressing (a dressing that will not stick to the rash) if you need to cover the blisters\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0avoids passing the virus to anyone else \n \n Calamine lotion has a soothing, cooling effect on the skin and can be used to relieve the itching. \n If you have any weeping blisters, you can use a cool compress (a cloth or a flannel cooled with tap water) several times a day to help soothe the skin and keep blisters clean. \n It's important to only use the compress for around 20 minutes at a time and stop using them once the blisters stop oozing. Don't share any cloths, towels or flannels if you have the shingles rash.\u00a0 \n Antiviral medication \n As well as painkilling medication, some people with shingles may also be prescribed a course of antiviral tablets lasting 7 to 10 days. Commonly prescribed antiviral medicines include aciclovir, valaciclovir and famciclovir. \n These medications cannot kill the shingles virus, but can help stop it multiplying. This may: \n \n reduce the severity of your shingles \n reduce how long your shingles lasts \n prevent  complications of shingles , such as postherpetic neuralgia (although the evidence for this is uncertain) \n \n Antiviral medicines are most effective when taken within 72 hours of your rash appearing, although they may be started up to a week after your rash appears if you are at risk of severe shingles or developing complications. \n Side effects of antiviral medication are very uncommon, but can include: \n \n feeling sick \n vomiting \n  diarrhoea  \n  abdominal (tummy) pain  \n  headaches  \n dizziness \n \n Who may be prescribed antiviral medication? \n If you are over 50 years of age and have  symptoms of shingles , it is likely you will be prescribed an antiviral medication. \n You may also be prescribed antiviral medication if you have: \n \n shingles that affects one of\u00a0your eyes \n a weakened immune system \n moderate to severe pain \n a moderate to severe rash \n \n Pregnancy and antiviral medication \n If you are pregnant and have shingles, it is likely your GP will discuss your case with a specialist to decide whether the benefits of antiviral medication significantly outweigh any possible risks. Shingles will not harm your unborn baby. \n If you are under 50 years of age, you are at less risk of developing complications from shingles anyway, so you may not need antiviral medication. \n Children and antiviral medication \n Antiviral medication is not usually necessary for otherwise healthy children because they usually only experience mild symptoms of shingles and have a small risk of developing complications. \n However, if your child has a weakened immune system, they may need to be admitted to hospital to receive antiviral medication directly into a vein (intravenously). \n Painkilling medication \n To ease the pain caused by shingles, your GP may recommend painkilling medication. Some of the main medications used to relieve pain associated with shingles are described below. \n Paracetamol \n The most commonly used painkiller is\u00a0 paracetamol , which is available without a prescription. Always read the manufacturer's instructions to make sure\u00a0the medicine is suitable and you are taking the correct dose. \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen , are an alternative type of painkilling medicine also available without a prescription. \n However, NSAIDs may not be suitable if you: \n \n have stomach, liver or kidney problems, such as a  stomach\u00a0ulcer , or had them in the past \n have  asthma  \n are pregnant or breastfeeding \n \n Ask your GP or pharmacist if you are unsure about whether you should take NSAIDs.\u00a0 \n Opioids \n For more severe pain, your GP may prescribe an opioid, such as codeine. This is a stronger type of painkiller sometimes prescribed alongside paracetamol. \n Occasionally, your GP may consider seeking specialist advice before prescribing an even\u00a0stronger opioid, such as morphine. \n Antidepressants \n If you have severe pain as a result of shingles, you may be prescribed an  antidepressant  medicine. These medications\u00a0are commonly used to treat  depression , but they have also proven to be useful in relieving nerve pain, such as the pain associated with shingles. \n The antidepressants most often used to treat shingles pain are known as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Examples of TCAs most commonly prescribed for people with shingles are amitriptyline, imipramine\u00a0and nortriptyline. \n Side effects of TCAs can include: \n \n  constipation  \n difficulty urinating \n blurred vision \n dry mouth \n weight gain \n drowsiness \n \n If you have shingles, you will usually be prescribed a much lower dose of TCAs than if you were being treated for depression. This will usually be a tablet to take at night. Your dose may be increased until your pain settles down. \n It may take several weeks before you start to feel the antidepressants working, although this is not always the case. \n Anticonvulsants \n Anticonvulsants are most commonly used to control\u00a0seizures (fits) caused by\u00a0 epilepsy , but they are also useful in relieving nerve pain. \n Gabapentin and pregabalin are the most commonly prescribed anticonvulsants for shingles pain. \n Side effects of these medications can include: \n \n dizziness \n drowsiness \n increased appetite \n weight gain \n feeling sick \n vomiting \n \n As with antidepressants, you may need to take anticonvulsants for several weeks before you notice it working. \n If your pain does not improve, your dose may be gradually increased until your symptoms are effectively managed.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will normally be able to diagnose shingles from your symptoms and the appearance of your rash. Testing is not usually necessary. \n Referral \n It is\u00a0uncommon for someone with shingles to be referred to a specialist for further assessment and treatment, but your GP may consider seeking specialist advice or referring you if: \n \n they think you may have a\u00a0 complication of shingles , such as\u00a0 meningitis  or\u00a0encephalitis \n shingles is affecting one of your eyes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0there is a risk\u00a0you could\u00a0develop permanent vision problems if the condition is not treated quickly \n you have a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 particularly in severe cases or cases affecting children \n you are pregnant \n a diagnosis is not certain \n \n You may also be referred to a specialist if you have an unusually persistent case of suspected shingles that is not responding to treatment, or if you have been diagnosed with the condition more than twice. \n Who might I see? \n Who you are referred to will depend on your circumstances.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Shortness of breath", "introduction": "Sudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnoea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department. \n It's also one of the most common reasons people call\u00a0999 for an ambulance. \n It's normal to\u00a0get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition. \n The information below outlines the most common reasons for: \n \n sudden shortness of breath \n long-term shortness of breath \n \n This guide shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what's causing your breathlessness. \n When to call a doctor \n You should\u00a0call your GP immediately if you have sudden shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart. \n Your GP will assess you over the phone, and\u00a0may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is\u00a0the result of\u00a0anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit. \n If you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. See your GP as it's likely you have a long-term condition, such as  obesity ,  asthma  or  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , which needs to be managed properly. \n Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: \n \n Did the breathlessness come on suddenly or gradually? \n Did anything trigger it, such as exercise? \n How bad is it? Does it only happen when you've been active, or when you're not doing anything? \n Is there any pain when you breathe? \n Do you have a cough? \n Do certain positions make it worse \u2013 for example, are you unable to lie down? \n \n Feeling like you can't get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed. \n Causes of sudden shortness of breath \n Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the links below for more information about these conditions. \n A problem with your lungs or airways \n Sudden breathlessness could be an  asthma  attack.\u00a0This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways. \n Your GP may advise you to\u00a0use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler.\u00a0This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness. \n Pneumonia\u00a0(lung inflammation) may also cause\u00a0shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection,\u00a0so you'll need to take  antibiotics . \n If you\u00a0have\u00a0COPD, it's likely\u00a0your breathlessness\u00a0is a sign\u00a0this condition has suddenly got worse. \n A heart problem\u00a0 \n It's possible to have a \"silent\"\u00a0 heart attack  without experiencing all the\u00a0obvious symptoms, such as\u00a0chest pain and overwhelming anxiety. \n In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having\u00a0a\u00a0heart attack. If you or your GP think this\u00a0is the case, they'll give you\u00a0 aspirin  and admit you to hospital straight away. \n  Heart failure \u00a0can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of water inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. \n A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness. \n Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as\u00a0atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate). \n Panic attack or anxiety \n A\u00a0 panic attack  or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag should bring your breathing back to normal. \n More unusual causes \n These include: \n \n a severe allergic reaction  (anaphylaxis)  \n pneumothorax\u00a0\u2013 partial collapse of your lung\u00a0caused by\u00a0a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs \n pulmonary embolism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a\u00a0blockage in one of the blood vessels in the lung \n  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \u00a0\u2013 a rare and poorly understood lung condition that causes scarring of the lungs \n pleural effusion\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0collection of fluid next to the lung \n diabetic ketoacidosis\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0complication of diabetes where acids build up in your blood and urine \n \n Causes of long-term breathlessness \n Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by: \n \n  obesity \u00a0or being unfit \n poorly controlled  asthma  \n  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u00a0\u2013 permanent damage to the lungs usually caused by years of smoking \n  anaemia \u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0low level of oxygen in the blood\u00a0caused\u00a0by\u00a0a lack of red blood cells or haemoglobin (the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen) \n  heart failure \u00a0\u2013 when your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly \n a\u00a0problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as\u00a0atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or\u00a0supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate) \n \n More unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are: \n \n  bronchiectasis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a\u00a0lung condition where the airways are abnormally widened and you have a persistent phlegmy cough \n pulmonary embolism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a\u00a0recurrent blockage in a blood vessel in the lung \n partial collapse of your lung caused by\u00a0 lung cancer  \n pleural effusion\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0collection of fluid next to the lung \n narrowing of the main heart valve, restricting blood flow to the rest of the body \n frequent  panic attacks , which can cause you to hyperventilate (take rapid or deep breaths)", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Sickle cell disease", "introduction": "Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of inherited conditions that affect the red blood cells. The most serious type is called sickle cell anaemia. \n Sickle cell disease\u00a0mainly affects people of African, Caribbean,\u00a0Middle Eastern, Eastern Mediterranean and Asian origin.\u00a0In the UK, it's particularly common\u00a0in\u00a0people with an African or Caribbean family background. \n People with sickle cell disease produce unusually shaped red blood cells that can cause problems because they don't live as long as healthy blood cells and\u00a0they can become stuck in blood vessels. \n Sickle cell disease is a serious and lifelong condition, although long-term treatment can help manage many of the problems associated with it. \n \u00a0 \n Symptoms of sickle cell disease \n People born with sickle cell disease sometimes experience problems from early childhood, although most children have few symptoms and lead normal lives most of the time. \n The main symptoms of sickle cell disease are: \n \n painful episodes called sickle cell crises, which can be very severe and can last up to\u00a0a week \n an increased risk of serious infections \n anaemia (where red blood cells can't carry enough oxygen around the body), which can cause tiredness and\u00a0 shortness of breath  \n \n Some people also experience other problems such as delayed growth,  strokes \u00a0and lung problems. \n Read more about the  symptoms of sickle cell disease  \n Causes of\u00a0sickle cell disease \n Sickle cell disease is caused by a faulty gene that affects how red blood cells develop. \n If both parents have this faulty gene, there's a 25% chance of each child they have being born with sickle cell disease. \n The child's parents often won't have the condition themselves because they're only\u00a0 carriers of the sickle cell trait  (see below). \n Read more about the  causes of sickle cell\u00a0disease  \n Screening and testing for sickle cell disease \n Sickle cell disease is often detected during pregnancy or soon after birth. \n  Screening for sickle cell disease in pregnancy \u00a0is offered to all pregnant women in Scotland\u00a0to\u00a0check if there's a risk of a child being born with the condition, and all babies are\u00a0offered screening\u00a0as part of the  newborn blood spot\u00a0test \u00a0(heel prick test). \n Blood tests can also be carried out at any\u00a0age to check for the condition or to see if you're a carrier of the faulty gene that causes it. \n Treatments for sickle cell disease \n People with sickle cell disease will need specialist care throughout their lives. \n A number of treatments are available to help manage problems caused by the condition. For example: \n \n painful episodes can sometimes be prevented by drinking plenty of fluids and staying warm \n pain can often be treated with ordinary painkillers such as  paracetamol \u00a0or\u00a0 ibuprofen , although sometimes treatment with stronger painkillers in hospital may be necessary \n the risk of infections can be reduced by taking daily\u00a0 antibiotics  and ensuring you're fully vaccinated \n a\u00a0 blood transfusion  may be needed if severe anaemia develops \n a medicine called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) can reduce the symptoms if they're interfering with your or your child's life \n having regular blood transfusions (usually every 3-4 weeks) may be helpful if problems continue or get worse, or there are signs of damage caused by the condition \n \n Stem cell or bone marrow transplants\u00a0can potentially cure sickle cell disease, but they're not done very often because of the significant risks involved. \n Read more about\u00a0 how sickle cell\u00a0disease\u00a0is treated \u00a0and  living with sickle cell disease  \n Outlook for sickle cell disease \n Sickle cell disease is very variable, but most children with it will lead happy and normal lives. \n However, it can still be a serious condition that can have a significant impact on a person's life. \n It can lead to problems such as strokes, serious infections and lung problems, which can occasionally be fatal. \n Overall, the life expectancy for someone with sickle cell disease tends to be shorter than normal, but this can vary depending on the exact type of sickle cell disease they have, how it's treated, and what problems they experience. \n Currently, people with sickle cell anaemia typically live until 40-60 years of age, although milder types of sickle cell disease may have no impact on life expectancy. It's hoped the outlook will continue to improve as newer treatments are developed. \n Carriers of sickle cell (sickle cell trait) \n A carrier of sickle cell is someone who carries one of the faulty genes that causes sickle cell disease, but doesn't have the condition themselves. It's also known as having the sickle cell trait. \n People who carry sickle cell\u00a0won't develop sickle cell disease, but are at risk of having a child with the condition if their partner is also a carrier. \n You can request a blood test to check if you have carry sickle cell\u00a0from your GP surgery. \n Read more about being a  sickle cell carrier", "symptoms": "Sickle cell disease can cause a wide range of symptoms. \n These can start from a few months of age, although many children have few or no symptoms if treatment is started early on. \n Some of the main symptoms are outlined below, although not everyone with the condition will experience all of these. \n Painful episodes \n Episodes of pain \u2013 known as sickle cell crises \u2013 are one of the most common and distressing symptoms of sickle cell disease. They occur when blood vessels to part of the body become blocked. \n The pain can be severe and lasts for up to seven days on average. \n A sickle cell crisis often affects a particular part of the body, such as the: \n \n hands or feet (particularly in young children) \n ribs and breastbone \n spine \n pelvis \n tummy \n legs and arms \n \n How often someone with sickle cell disease gets episodes of pain varies a lot. Some people may have one every few weeks, while others may have less than one a year. The average is one bad episode a year. \n It's not always clear what triggers bad pain, but sometimes they can be caused by the weather (such as wind, rain or cold),\u00a0 dehydration , stress or strenuous exercise. \n Infections \n People with sickle cell\u00a0disease are more vulnerable to infections, particularly when they're young. \n This is because the condition can mean the body isn't very good at dealing with bacteria and viruses. \n Infections that\u00a0may occur can range from mild (such as  colds ), to much more serious and potentially life-threatening (such as\u00a0 meningitis ). \n Vaccinations and daily doses of\u00a0 antibiotics  can help reduce the risk of many infections. \n Anaemia \n Nearly all people with sickle cell disease have anaemia, where the haemoglobin in the blood is low. Haemoglobin is the substance found in red blood cells that's used to transport oxygen around the body. \n This doesn't usually cause many symptoms, but sometimes it can get worse if you become infected with the virus that causes\u00a0 slapped cheek syndrome  (parvovirus). \n This can lead to a sudden drop in the number of red blood cells and may cause additional symptoms such as\u00a0 headaches , a rapid heartbeat,\u00a0dizziness and\u00a0fainting. It's usually treated with a blood transfusion. \n In young children, swelling of the spleen can also cause sudden anaemia that requires a blood transfusion. \n Other problems \n Sickle cell disease can also sometimes cause a wide range of other problems, including: \n \n delayed growth during childhood\u00a0and delayed puberty \n  gallstones \u00a0(small stones in the gallbladder), which\u00a0can cause  tummy (abdominal) pain \u00a0and yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) \n bone and\u00a0joint pain \n priapism (a persistent and painful erection of the penis), which can sometimes last several hours \n  leg ulcers  (painful, open sores on the lower legs) \n  strokes \u00a0or\u00a0 transient ischaemic attacks  (where the flow of blood to the brain is blocked or interrupted) \n a serious lung condition called\u00a0acute chest syndrome, which can cause a fever,  cough , chest pain, and breathing difficulties \n swelling of the spleen, which can cause shortness of breath, a rapid heartbeat, abdominal pain, a swollen tummy and worse anaemia \n vision problems, such as\u00a0floaters, blurred or patchy vision, reduced night vision and occasionally sudden\u00a0vision loss \n  pulmonary hypertension \u00a0(high blood pressure in the blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs) \n kidney or urinary problems, including\u00a0blood in\u00a0the urine and  bedwetting  \n \n See\u00a0 treatments for sickle cell disease  for information about how many of these problems are treated.", "causes": "Sickle cell disease is caused by faulty genes that a child inherits from their parents. \n It's not caused by anything the parents did before or during the pregnancy and you can't catch it from someone who has it. \n How sickle cell disease is inherited \n Genes come in pairs. You inherit one set from your mother and one set from your father. \n To be born with sickle cell disease, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty sickle cell gene from both of their parents. \n This usually happens when both parents are \"carriers\" of the faulty gene \u2013 also known as having the sickle cell trait. \n  Sickle cell carriers \u00a0don't have\u00a0sickle cell disease\u00a0themselves, but there's a chance they could have a child with the condition if their partner is also a carrier. \n If both parents are sickle cell carriers, there's a: \n \n 1 in 4 (25%) chance each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won't have sickle cell disease or be able to pass it on \n 1 in 2 (50%) chance each child they have will just inherit a copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier \n 1 in 4 (25%) chance each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will be born with sickle cell disease \n \n The Sickle Cell Society has more information about the  inheritance of sickle cell disease , including what the risks are if\u00a0a parent has sickle cell disease themselves. \n Who's most at risk of sickle cell disease? \n Sickle cell disease mainly affects people with an African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern, Eastern Mediterranean and Asian family background. \n In the UK, it's most commonly seen in people of African and Caribbean backgrounds. It's estimated that one in every 10 people in this group carries sickle cell. \n A simple blood test will show whether you're a carrier. This is done routinely during pregnancy and after birth, but you can ask to have the test at any time. \n Read more about\u00a0 getting tested for the sickle cell trait  and  being a sickle cell\u00a0carrier  \n How sickle cell disease affects the body \n Your genes are the set of instructions found inside every cell in your body. They\u00a0determine characteristics such as the colour of your eyes and hair. \n People with sickle cell disease have a problem with the genes involved in the development of haemoglobin\u00a0\u2013 a substance found in red blood cells that carry oxygen around the body. \n Normal red blood cells are flexible and disc-shaped, but in sickle cell disease they can become rigid and shaped like a crescent or sickle because the haemoglobin inside them clumps together. \n These unusual cells can cause\u00a0 symptoms of sickle cell disease  because they don't live as long as normal red blood cells and can become stuck in blood vessels.", "treatment": "Sickle cell disease usually requires lifelong treatment. \n Some of the main treatments that may be used are outlined below: \n  Preventing painful episodes  \n  Treating pain  \n  Preventing infections  \n  Treatments for anaemia  \n  Stem cell or bone marrow transplants  \n  Treating other problems  \n Children and adults with sickle cell disease will be supported by a\u00a0team of different healthcare professionals working together in a specialist sickle cell centre. \n Your care team will help you learn more about the condition and work with you to come up with an individual\u00a0care plan that takes into account all your needs and health concerns. \n Preventing painful episodes \n The main thing you can do to reduce your chances of experiencing a painful episode (sickle cell crisis) is to try avoiding possible triggers. \n This may mean you need to: \n \n drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration \n wear appropriate clothing to stop you getting cold \n avoid sudden temperature changes, such as swimming in cold water \n \n Read\u00a0about  living with sickle cell disease \u00a0for more advice. \n If you continue to experience episodes of pain, a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) may be recommended. This is usually taken as a capsule once a day. \n Hydroxycarbamide can lower the amount of other blood cells, such as white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells), so regular\u00a0 blood tests  will usually be recommended to monitor your health. \n Treating pain \n If you experience a sickle cell crisis, you can usually manage it at home. The following can help: \n \n take\u00a0over-the-counter painkillers, such as  paracetamol \u00a0or  ibuprofen  (aspirin should not be given to children under 16) \u2013\u00a0if the\u00a0pain is more severe, your GP may prescribe stronger painkillers \n ensure you have\u00a0plenty to drink \n use a warm towel or a heated pad to gently massage the affected body part\u00a0\u2013 many pharmacies sell pads that can be used for this purpose \n try suitable distractions\u00a0to take\u00a0your mind off the pain\u2013 for example, children might like to read a story, watch a film or play their favourite computer game \n \n Contact your GP if these measures don't work or the\u00a0pain is particularly severe. If this isn't possible, take your child to your local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department. \n Treatment with\u00a0very strong painkillers (such as morphine) in hospital for a few days may\u00a0be needed. \n Preventing infections \n As people with sickle cell disease are more vulnerable to infections, treatment will usually be needed to reduce this risk. \n Most people need to take a daily dose of\u00a0 antibiotics  (usually penicillin), often for the rest of their life. Long-term use of antibiotics won't pose any serious risks to your health. \n Children with sickle cell disease should also have all the\u00a0 routine vaccinations , and possibly also additional vaccinations such as the annual flu vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine. \n Treatments for anaemia \n Anaemia often causes few symptoms and may not require specific treatment. \n However, dietary supplements such as\u00a0folic acid (which helps stimulate the production of red blood cells) may sometimes be required to help improve anaemia if your child has a restricted diet, such as a vegetarian or vegan diet. \n Anaemia caused by sickle cell disease isn't the same as the more common  iron deficiency anaemia . Don't take iron supplements to treat it without seeking medical advice as they could be dangerous. \n If anaemia is particularly severe or persistent, treatment with  blood transfusions  or\u00a0hydroxycarbamide may be necessary. \n Stem cell or bone marrow transplants \n Stem cell or bone marrow transplants\u00a0are the only cure for sickle cell disease, but\u00a0they're not done very often because of the significant risks involved. \n Stem cells are special cells produced by bone marrow (a spongy tissue found in the centre of some bones) that can turn into different types of blood cells. \n For a stem cell transplant, stem cells from a healthy donor are given through a drip into a vein. These cells then start to produce healthy red blood cells to replace the sickle cells. \n A stem cell transplant is an intensive treatment that carries a number of risks. The main risk is graft versus host disease, which is a life-threatening problem where the transplanted cells start to attack the other cells in your body. \n Stem cell transplants are generally only considered in children with sickle cell disease who have severe symptoms that haven't responded to other treatments, when the long-term benefits of a transplant are thought to outweigh the possible risks. \n Treating other problems \n Sickle cell disease can also cause a number of\u00a0other problems that may need to be treated. For example: \n \n a\u00a0short course of hormonal medication may be prescribed to help trigger puberty in children with delayed puberty \n  gallstones  may be treated with gallbladder removal surgery \n bone and joint pain can be treated with painkillers, although more severe cases may require surgery \n persistent priapism (a persistent and painful erection) may require medication to stimulate blood flow or\u00a0using a needle to drain blood from the penis \n  leg ulcers \u00a0can be treated by cleaning the ulcer and dressing it with a bandage (read more about  treating leg ulcers ) \n people at increased risk of having a  stroke , or those who've had a stroke, may need regular blood transfusions or treatment with hydroxycarbamide \n acute chest syndrome\u00a0(a serious lung condition) usually requires emergency treatment with antibiotics, blood transfusions, oxygen and fluids given into a vein\u00a0\u2013 hydroxycarbamide\u00a0may be needed to prevent further episodes \n \n People who need a lot of blood transfusions may also need to take medication to reduce the amount of iron in their blood to safe levels. This is called chelation therapy.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Sickle cell disease is usually detected during pregnancy or soon after birth. \n Blood tests can also be carried out at any time to check for the condition or to see if you're a\u00a0 sickle cell carrier  and are at risk of having a child with the condition. \n Screening during pregnancy \n Screening to check if a baby is at risk of being born with sickle cell disease is offered to all pregnant women in Scotland. \n You can also ask to have the test even if your family origins don't suggest your baby would be at high risk of sickle cell disease. \n Screening\u00a0should ideally be carried out before you're 10 weeks pregnant, so you and your partner have time to consider the option of further tests to find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease. \n Read more about  screening for sickle cell disease during pregnancy  \n Newborn screening \n In Scotland, screening for sickle cell\u00a0disease is offered\u00a0as part of the newborn blood spot test\u00a0(heel prick test). \n This can help to: \n \n indicate whether your baby has sickle cell disease if pregnancy screening suggested they were at high risk but you decided not to have tests to confirm the diagnosis at the time \n identify any babies with sickle cell disease whose parents weren't screened while pregnant \n show if your baby is a carrier of sickle cell and is at risk of having children of their own with the condition \n pick up certain other inherited conditions, such as  cystic fibrosis  \n \n If newborn screening suggests your baby may have sickle cell disease, a second blood test will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. \n Read more about the\u00a0 newborn blood spot test  \n Testing for the sickle cell carriers \n A blood test can be done at any time to find out if you carry sickle cell and are at risk of having a child with sickle cell disease. This is also known as having the sickle cell trait. \n Getting tested can be particularly useful if you have a family history of the condition or your partner is known to carry sickle cell. \n If you think you could be a carrier, you can ask for a test from your GP surgery. \n Both men and women can have the test. \n Read more\u00a0information about\u00a0 sickle cell carriers"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ringworm and other fungal infections", "introduction": "Ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. Ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Despite its name, ringworm doesn't have anything to do with worms. \n Other similar fungal infections can affect the scalp, feet, groin and nails. These fungal infections, medically known as \"tinea\", are not serious and are usually easily treated. However,\u00a0they are\u00a0contagious and easily spread. \n Tinea fungal infections \n There are different types of tinea fungal infection, based on the affected area of the body: \n \n ringworm\u00a0(tinea corporis) \u2013 affecting the body \n  fungal nail infection (onychomycosis)  \u2013 affecting the nails \n athlete's foot (tinea pedis) \u2013 affecting the feet \n jock itch (tinea cruris) \u2013 affecting the groin \n tinea capitis \u2013 affecting the scalp \n \n Ringworm usually looks like a round, red or silvery patch of skin that may be scaly, inflamed and itchy, but other fungal infections may present themselves slightly differently. Read more about the  symptoms of ringworm and other tinea fungal infections . \n When to see a doctor \n See your GP if you or your child has a fungal scalp infection, as it\u2019s treated with antifungal tablets, which are only available on prescription. Symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include small patches of scaly scalp skin (which may be sore), patchy hair loss and itchiness. Other types of fungal infections (including ringworm) are generally treated with antifungal cream from the pharmacy, and you don't need to see a doctor unless it persists. However, pharmacists often prefer children to see a GP to confirm a diagnosis. \n What\u2019s the cause? \n Fungal spores are passed between people through direct skin contact and by sharing objects such as towels, hairbrushes and bedding. Athlete\u2019s foot is commonly spread in gym and swimming pool changing rooms.    Pets, such as dogs and cats, can have ringworm, and you can catch it by stroking them.    Read more about the  causes of ringworm . \n Who is affected? \n It's estimated that 10-20% of people will have\u00a0ringworm in their lifetime.    Although children are more likely to get this, people of all ages can be affected.    Groin infections are more common in young men.    Fungal scalp infections (tinea capitis) are most common in children who have not reached puberty, particularly African-Caribbean children and those who live in urban areas. \n Treatment \n Most ringworm infections are mild and can be treated using a pharmacy antifungal cream. Scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes combined with antifungal shampoo. If the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may need  treatment with antibiotics . Read more about  how to treat fungal infections . \n Stopping it spreading \n It's important to prevent the infection spreading. You should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection. If you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. If your pet is treated quickly, you\u2019ll be less likely to catch it. If your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should inform their teacher. In addition to treatment, your child should maintain a good level of personal hygiene to prevent the infection spreading. Read more about  how to stop the spread of fungal infections .", "symptoms": "The symptoms of a tinea fungal infection depend on where the infection is. \n Ringworm (on the skin) \n The symptoms of ringworm include: \n \n a ring-like red or silvery rash on your skin \u2013 your skin will look red and irritated around the ring, but healthy inside \n scaly, itchy and inflamed skin \n \n In more severe cases: \n \n the rings may multiply, grow in size and merge together \n the rings may feel slightly raised and the skin underneath may be itchy \n blisters and pus-filled sores may form around the rings \n \n The ring spreads outwards as it progresses. You can have one patch or several patches of ringworm, and in more serious cases, your skin may become raised and blistered. \n Face and neck ringworm \n Ringworm\u00a0on the face and neck may not appear ring-shaped, but may be itchy and swollen, and it can become dry and crusted. If you have a beard, you may notice patches of hair breaking away. \n Hand ringworm \n Ringworm on the hand often causes the skin to become thicker on the palm and in between the fingers. It may affect one hand or both and normally only appears on one side. \n Fungal scalp infection (tinea capitis) \n The symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include: \n \n small patches of scaly skin on the scalp, which may be sore \n patchy hair loss \n an itchy scalp \n \n In more severe cases: \n \n small, pus-filled sores on the scalp \n crusting on the scalp \n bald patches (if your hair is affected) \n \n In very severe cases, a large inflamed sore called a kerion may form on your scalp. This can ooze pus, and you may also have a fever and swollen lymph glands. \n Athlete\u2019s foot (tinea pedis) \n The main symptom of athlete\u2019s foot is an itchy, dry, red and flaky rash, usually in the spaces between your toes. In more severe cases, you may have: \n \n cracked skin in the affected area \n  blisters , which may ooze or crust \n swelling of the skin \n a burning or stinging sensation in your skin \n scaling patterns around your sole, between your toes and on the side of your foot \n \n Jock itch (tinea cruris) \n The symptoms of jock itch include: \n \n red-brown sores, which may have blisters or pus-filled sores around the edge \n itchiness and redness around your groin area, such as your inner thighs and bottom (the genitals are not usually affected) \n scaly, flaky skin on your inner thighs \n \n Exercising, walking and wearing tight clothing or underwear can make the symptoms of a groin infection worse. \n Fungal nail infection (onychomycosis) \n The symptoms of a fungal nail infection include: \n \n a whitish thickening of the nail \n discolouration (the nail can turn white, black, yellow or green) \n the nail can become brittle and start to fall off \n the skin around the nail may be sore and irritated \n \n Read more about  fungal nail infection .\u00a0\u00a0 \n When to seek medical advice \n Make an appointment to see your GP if you: \n \n or your child develop the symptoms of a fungal scalp infection \n have ringworm that has not improved after two weeks of treatment with antifungal cream \n have another medical condition, or you\u2019re having medical treatment that is known to weaken your immune system, such as  chemotherapy  or steroid tablets \n \n Read more about  how fungal infections are diagnosed .", "causes": "Tinea fungal infections are caused by a particular type of fungi, called dermatophytes, which live off keratin.Keratin is a tough, waterproof tissue found in many parts of your body, including your skin, hair and nails.This explains why fungal infections mostly affect your skin, scalp or nails. \n How it spreads \n The fungi are tiny spores tough enough to survive for months on your skin, in soil or on household objects, such as combs or towels. They thrive in heat and moisture, which helps them to grow and explains why they are often spread in swimming pool changing rooms and communal showers. The spores can be spread in four different ways: \n \n human-to-human contact \n human-to-animal contact \u2013 for example, by stroking an infected dog or cat \n human-to-object contact \u2013 both animals and humans can leave traces of fungi spores on objects and surfaces, such as towels, clothing, bed linen, combs or brushes \n human-to-soil contact \u2013 less commonly, it can develop after lengthy exposure to infected soil \n \n As an adult, you can become a carrier of a scalp infection without developing any symptoms. This is because your body has usually developed a defence against the infection by the time you reach adulthood. If you\u2019re a carrier of a fungal infection, you can unknowingly pass the condition on to children, who may then go on to develop symptoms. \n Risk groups \n You are more likely to develop a fungal infection if you: \n \n are very young or very old \n are African-Caribbean (in the case of scalp infections) \n have  type 1 diabetes  \n are very overweight ( obese ) \n have a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as  HIV or AIDS  \n are receiving medical treatment that weakens your immune system, such as  chemotherapy  or steroid tablets \n have had fungal infections in the past \n have hardened arteries (atherosclerosis) \n have poor circulation (specifically, a condition called venous insufficiency, where the veins in your legs have trouble moving blood back to your heart)", "treatment": "Most tinea fungal infections, including ringworm, are easily treated by using antifungal creams, tablets or shampoo. You can also help to get rid of fungal infections and stop them from spreading by: \n \n washing areas of affected skin daily and drying thoroughly, paying particular attention to skin folds and between your toes \n in the case of a groin/foot infection, changing your underwear/socks daily, because fungi can persist in flakes of skin \n with a scalp infection, not sharing combs, hairbrushes or hats \n washing clothes, towels and bed linen frequently \n wearing loose-fitting clothes, preferably made of cotton or other natural materials \n \n Read more about  preventing ringworm . \n Ringworm, groin infections and athlete\u2019s foot \n Most cases of ringworm, groin infections and athlete\u2019s foot can be treated using an over-the-counter antifungal cream, gel or spray. There are lots of different types, so ask your pharmacist to help you choose the right one for you. You usually apply antifungal creams, gels and sprays daily to the affected areas of skin for two weeks. The cream, gel or spray should be applied over the rash and to one inch of skin beyond the edge of the rash. Read the manufacturer's instructions first. You may be advised to use the treatment for a further two weeks, to reduce the risk of re-infection. See your GP if your symptoms have not improved after two weeks of treatment, because you may need to take antifungal tablets. Both terbinafine and griseofulvin tablets can be used to treat ringworm infections, as well as another antifungal medicine called itraconazole (see below). \n Treat groin and feet together \n Groin infections can sometimes occur at the same time as athlete's foot. It's vital to treat both infections at the same time to avoid being re-infected with either condition. \n Fungal scalp infections \n Scalp infections are usually treated using antifungal tablets, often alongside an antifungal shampoo. There are two main types of antifungal tablet: \n \n terbinafine \n griseofulvin \n \n The antifungal medicine that your GP prescribes will depend on the type of fungi causing the infection. \n Terbinafine tablets \n Most people with fungal scalp infections are prescribed terbinafine tablets to take once a day for four weeks. It's an effective treatment for most cases. Side effects of terbinafine can include: \n \n nausea \n  diarrhoea  \n  indigestion  \n rashes \n \n These side effects are usually mild and short-lived. Some people have also reported that terbinafine temporarily affected their sense of taste.    Terbinafine is not suitable for people with a history of  liver disease  or  lupus  (where the immune system attacks healthy tissue). \n Griseofulvin \n Griseofulvin is a type of antifungal medicine that prevents fungi from growing and multiplying. It\u2019s available in the form of a spray and is usually taken daily for 8-10 weeks. Side effects of griseofulvin can include:\u00a0 \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n mild  diarrhoea  \n  headache  \n indigestion\u00a0 \n \n However, these side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine. Griseofulvin can cause birth defects, so it shouldn't be taken during pregnancy, or if you intend to become pregnant soon after stopping treatment. Men shouldn't father a child within six months of stopping treatment. Griseofulvin is also not suitable for women who are breastfeeding, and those with severe liver disease or lupus. Griseofulvin can interfere with both the combined contraceptive pill and the progestogen-only pill, so women need to use an alternative barrier form of contraception, such as a  condom , while taking it. Griseofulvin may also affect your ability to drive and can enhance the effects of alcohol. \n Antifungal shampoo \n Antifungal shampoo cannot cure scalp infections, but it can help to prevent the infection spreading and may speed up recovery. Antifungal shampoos, such as selenium sulphide and ketoconazole shampoo, are available from your pharmacist. Ideally, antifungal shampoo should be used twice a week during the first two weeks of treatment. There is no evidence that shaving a child's head will reduce the risk of an infection or speed up recovery. \n Itraconazole \n Itraconazole is usually prescribed in the form of capsules for 7 or 15 days. It is not recommended for use in children, elderly people or those with severe liver disease. Side effects of itraconazole can include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n indigestion \n diarrhoea \n headache \n \n Read about  how to stop ringworm spreading or coming back . \n Fungal nail infections \n Fungal nail infections can be treated with antifungal nail paint, but it also often requires antifungal tablets. These tend to work better than nail paints, although they can cause side effects, such as headache, nausea and diarrhoea.

Knowing exactly which fungus is causing the infection is useful, because some antifungal medications are better at treating certain types. Your GP will take a small scraping of skin from your scalp to test in a laboratory. You may be given an antifungal medication before you receive your test results. If the tests show that a different antifungal medication would work better, you will be prescribed that instead. \n Ringworm and other fungal infections \n Most fungal infections can be diagnosed by your GP after examining your skin and asking whether you have other related symptoms. Further tests will usually only be needed if your symptoms are severe or if they fail to respond to antifungal treatment. If this happens, your GP may take a small scraping of affected skin for analysis in a laboratory. Microscopic analysis will show if fungi are present and the specific type that is causing your infection. Read about  how to treat ringworm and other fungal infections ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Scarlet fever", "introduction": "Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash. \n The illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as group A streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat. \n Generally, scarlet fever is much less common than it used to be but in recent years there have been a number of significant outbreaks. \n For example, figures published by\u00a0Public Health England show that from September 2013 to March 2014 there were 2,830 cases of scarlet fever. For the same period in 2014/15 a total of 5,746 cases were recorded. The reason for recent increase is unclear. \n It\u2019s important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of scarlet fever so that early treatment with\u00a0 antibiotics  can be given. \n Scarlet fever symptoms \n Scarlet fever usually follows a  sore\u00a0throat  or a skin infection, such as  impetigo , caused by particular strains of streptococcus bacteria. \n Initial symptoms usually include a sore throat, headache and a high temperature (38.3C/101F or above), flushed cheeks and a swollen tongue. \n A day or two later the characteristic pinkish rash appears. It usually occurs on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck. \n The\u00a0 symptoms of scarlet fever  usually develop two to five days after infection, although the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as seven days. \n The rash feels like sandpaper to touch and it may be itchy. On darker skin the rash may be more difficult to see although its rough texture should be apparent. \n When to seek medical advice \n Scarlet fever usually clears up after about a week, but if you think you or your child may have it, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. \n Your GP should be able to diagnose scarlet fever by examining the distinctive rash and asking about other symptoms. They may also decide to take a sample of saliva from the back of the throat so it can be tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. \n There's no evidence to suggest that catching scarlet fever when pregnant will put your baby at risk. However, if you're heavily pregnant, tell the doctors and midwives in charge of your care if you've been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever. \n How scarlet fever spreads \n Scarlet fever is very contagious and can be caught by: \n \n breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs and sneezes \n touching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection, such as impetigo \n sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen \n \n It can also be caught from carriers \u2013 people who have the bacteria in their throat or on their skin but don't have any symptoms. \n Who's affected by scarlet fever \n Most cases (about 80%) of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between two and eight years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness. \n As it's so contagious, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks often occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another. \n The symptoms of scarlet fever will only develop in people susceptible to toxins produced by the streptococcus bacteria. Most children over 10 years of age will have developed immunity to these toxins. \n It's possible to catch scarlet fever more than once, but this is rare. \n Treating scarlet fever \n Scarlet fever used to be a very serious illness, but nowadays most cases tend to be mild. \n It can easily be treated with antibiotics. Liquid antibiotics, such as penicillin or amoxicillin,\u00a0are often used to treat children. These must be taken for 10 days, even though most people recover after four to five days. \n It's important to be aware that your child will still be infectious for 24 hours after antibiotic treatment has begun, and therefore they shouldn't attend nursery or school during this period (see below). \n Without antibiotic treatment, your child\u00a0will be infectious for 1-2 weeks after symptoms appear. \n Read more about  treating scarlet fever . \n Complications of scarlet fever \n With the right treatment, further problems are unlikely. However, there's a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections, such as an  ear infection ,  sinusitis , or  pneumonia . \n Read more about  complications of scarlet fever . \n Preventing scarlet fever from spreading \n There\u2019s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever. \n If your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. \n GPs, schools and nurseries should be aware of the current high levels of scarlet fever and inform local health protection teams if they become aware of cases, particularly if more than one child is affected. \n Children and adults should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze and wash their hands with soap and water after using or disposing of tissues. \n Avoid sharing contaminated utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen or towels.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of scarlet fever usually take two to five days to appear after infection. \n However, the incubation period (the time between exposure to the\u00a0infection and symptoms starting) can be as short as one day or as long as seven days. \n The symptoms of scarlet fever include a\u00a0 sore throat ,\u00a0 headache , high temperature (38.3C/101F) or above),\u00a0flushed face and swollen tongue. The distinctive pink-red rash develops 12 to 48 hours later. \n Rash \n Red blotches are the first sign of the rash.\u00a0These turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch and looks like  sunburn . It may also be itchy. \n The rash\u00a0usually starts on the chest and stomach, but soon spreads to other parts of the body, such as the ears, neck, elbows, inner thighs and groin. \n The rash doesn't usually spread to the face.\u00a0However, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The rash will turn white if you press a glass on it. \n The rash usually fades after about a week, but the outer layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for several weeks afterwards. \n In milder cases, sometimes called scarlatina, the\u00a0rash may be the only symptom. \n Other symptoms \n Other symptoms\u00a0may include: \n \n  swollen neck glands  \n loss of appetite \n nausea or vomiting \n red lines\u00a0in the folds of the body, such as the armpit,\u00a0which may last a couple of days after the rash has gone \n a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue) \n a general feeling of being unwell \n \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP as soon as possible if you think you or your child has scarlet fever.\u00a0Although the illness usually clears up after about a week, your GP will be able to confirm a diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment.", "causes": "", "treatment": "Most cases of scarlet fever clear up after about a week without treatment. However, treatment is recommended. \n Treatment reduces the length of time you're contagious, speeds up recovery and lowers the risk of  complications of scarlet fever . \n With treatment, most people recover\u00a0in about four to\u00a0five days and can return to nursery, school or work 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment. \n Without treatment, you'll be contagious for one to two weeks after symptoms appear. \n Antibiotics \n Scarlet fever is usually treated with a 10-day course of  antibiotics . This is often in the form of penicillin or amoxicillin tablets, although liquid may be used for young children. \n For people who are allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotics such as erythromycin can be used instead. \n The fever usually gets better within 24 hours of starting antibiotics, with the other symptoms disappearing\u00a0within a few days. However, it's important that the whole course of treatment is completed to ensure the infection is fully cleared. \n Keep your child away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment. Adults with scarlet fever should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment. \n Self care \n Many of the symptoms of scarlet fever can be relieved using some simple self care measures, such as: \n \n drinking plenty of cool fluids \n eating soft foods (if\u00a0your throat is painful) \n taking\u00a0 paracetamol \u00a0to bring down a high temperature \n using calamine lotion or\u00a0antihistamine tablets to relieve itching", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)", "introduction": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are passed from one person to another through unprotected sex or genital contact. \n You can be tested for STIs at a sexual health clinic,\u00a0genitourinary medicine (GUM)\u00a0clinic or GP surgery.  Search for a sexual health clinic \u00a0near you and find out what services they offer. \n This page provides an overview of the different STIs and links to more information about these conditions. \n Chlamydia \n Chlamydia is the most common STI in the UK and is easily passed on during sex. Most people don't experience\u00a0any symptoms, so they\u00a0are unaware they're\u00a0infected. \n In women, chlamydia can cause pain or\u00a0a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between\u00a0periods. It can also cause heavy periods. \n In men, chlamydia can cause pain or\u00a0a burning sensation when urinating, a white, cloudy or watery discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. \n It's also possible to have a chlamydia infection in your rectum (bottom), throat or eyes. \n Diagnosing chlamydia\u00a0is done with a urine test or by taking a swab of the affected area.\u00a0The infection\u00a0is easily treated with  antibiotics , but can\u00a0lead to serious long-term health problems if\u00a0left untreated, including infertility.\u00a0 \n Genital warts \n Genital warts are small fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes that appear on or around your genital or anal area. They're caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) and\u00a0are the second most common STI in England after chlamydia. \n The warts are usually painless, but you may notice some\u00a0 itching  or redness. Occasionally, they can cause bleeding. \n You\u00a0don't need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. \n Several treatments are available for genital warts, including\u00a0creams and freezing the warts (cryotherapy). \n Read more about  genital warts  \n Genital herpes \n Genital herpes is a common infection caused by\u00a0the  herpes simplex virus (HSV) , which is the same virus that\u00a0causes cold sores. \n Some people develop symptoms of HSV a few days after coming into contact with the virus. Small, painful blisters or sores usually develop, which may cause itching or tingling, or make it painful to urinate. \n After you've been infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive) most of the time. However, certain triggers can reactivate the virus, causing the blisters to develop again, although they're usually smaller and less painful. \n It's easier to test for HSV if you have symptoms. Although there's no cure for genital herpes, the symptoms can usually be controlled using antiviral medicines. \n Read more about  genital herpes  \n Gonorrhoea \n Gonorrhoea is a bacterial STI\u00a0easily passed on during sex. About 50% of women and 10% of men don't experience any symptoms and are unaware they're infected. \n In women, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a vaginal discharge (often watery, yellow or green), pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding during or after sex or between periods, sometimes causing heavy periods. \n In men, gonorrhoea can cause pain or a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow or green discharge from the tip of the penis, and pain or tenderness in the testicles. \n It's also possible to have a gonorrhoea infection in your rectum, throat or eyes. \n Gonorrhoea is diagnosed using a urine test or by taking a swab of the affected area.\u00a0The infection is easily treated with antibiotics, but can lead to serious long-term health problems\u00a0if left untreated, including infertility. \n Syphilis \n Syphilis is a bacterial infection that in the early stages causes a painless, but highly infectious, sore on your genitals or around the mouth. The sore can last up to six\u00a0weeks before disappearing. \n Secondary symptoms such as a rash, flu-like illness or patchy\u00a0hair loss may\u00a0then develop. These may disappear within a few weeks, after which you'll have\u00a0a symptom-free phase. \n The late or tertiary stage of syphilis usually occurs after many years, and can cause serious conditions such as heart problems,\u00a0paralysis and blindness. \n The\u00a0symptoms of syphilis can be difficult to recognise. A\u00a0simple\u00a0 blood test  can usually be used to\u00a0diagnose syphilis\u00a0at any stage. The condition can be treated with antibiotics, usually penicillin injections. When syphilis is treated properly, the later stages can be prevented. \n HIV \n HIV is most commonly passed on\u00a0through unprotected sex.\u00a0It can also be transmitted by coming into contact with infected blood\u00a0\u2013 for example, sharing needles to inject steroids or drugs. \n The HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system, making it less able to fight infections and disease. There's no cure for HIV, but there are treatments that allow most people to live a long and otherwise healthy life. \n AIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. \n Most people with HIV look and feel healthy and have no symptoms. When you first develop HIV, you may experience a flu-like illness with a fever, sore throat or rash. This is called a seroconversion illness. \n A simple blood test is usually used to test for an HIV infection. Some clinics may also offer a rapid test using\u00a0a finger-prick blood test or saliva sample. \n Read more about  HIV and AIDS  \n Trichomoniasis \n Trichomoniasis is an STI caused by a tiny\u00a0parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). It can be easily passed\u00a0on through sex and most people\u00a0don't know\u00a0they're infected. \n In women,\u00a0trichomoniasis can cause a frothy yellow or watery vaginal discharge that has an unpleasant smell, soreness or itching around the vagina, and pain when passing urine. \n In men,\u00a0trichomoniasis rarely causes symptoms. You may experience pain or burning after passing urine, a whitish discharge, or an inflamed foreskin. \n Trichomoniasis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose and your GP may suggest you go to a specialist clinic for a urine or swab test. Once diagnosed, it\u00a0can usually be treated with antibiotics. \n Pubic lice \n Pubic lice (\"crabs\") are\u00a0easily passed to others through close genital contact. They're usually found in pubic hair, but can live in underarm hair,\u00a0body hair, beards and occasionally eyebrows or eyelashes. \n The lice crawl from hair to hair but don't jump or fly from person to person. It may take several weeks for you to notice any symptoms. Most people experience itching, and\u00a0you may notice the lice or eggs on the hairs. \n Pubic lice can usually be successfully treated with special creams or shampoos\u00a0available over the counter in most pharmacies or from a GP or GUM clinic. You don't need to shave off your pubic hair or body hair. \n Scabies \n Scabies is caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin.\u00a0It can be passed on through close body or sexual contact, or from infected clothing, bedding or towels. \n If you develop scabies, you may have intense itching that's worse at night. The itching can be in your genital area, but it also often occurs between your fingers, on wrists and ankles, under your arms, or on your body and breasts. \n You may have a rash or tiny spots. In some people, scabies can be confused\u00a0with  eczema . It's usually very difficult to see the mites. \n Scabies can usually be successfully treated using\u00a0special creams or shampoos\u00a0available over the counter in most pharmacies, or from a GP or GUM clinic. The itching can sometimes continue for a short period, even after effective treatment. \n Read more about  scabies", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Schizophrenia", "introduction": "Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including: \n \n hallucinations\u00a0\u2013 hearing or seeing things that do not exist \n delusions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0unusual beliefs not based on reality that often contradict the evidence \n muddled thoughts based on hallucinations or delusions \n changes in behaviour \n \n Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a psychotic illness.\u00a0This means sometimes a person may not be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality. \n Read more about the  symptoms of schizophrenia . \n Why does schizophrenia happen? \n The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. However, most experts believe\u00a0the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. \n It is thought certain things make you more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia, and\u00a0certain situations can\u00a0trigger the condition. \n Read more about the  causes of schizophrenia . \n Who is affected? \n Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. About\u00a01 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives. \n Schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Men and women are affected\u00a0equally. \n There is no single test for schizophrenia. It is most often diagnosed after an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist. \n It is important that schizophrenia is diagnosed as early as possible, as the chances of recovery improve the earlier it is treated. \n Read more about  diagnosing schizophrenia . \n How is schizophrenia treated? \n Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy\u00a0appropriate to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic\u00a0medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \n People with schizophrenia will usually receive help from a community mental health team (CMHT), which will offer day-to-day support and treatment. \n Many people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help\u00a0reduce the impact\u00a0the condition has\u00a0on your life. \n Read more about treating schizophrenia. \n Living with schizophrenia \n If schizophrenia is well managed, it is possible to reduce the chances of severe relapses. This can include: \n \n recognising the signs of an acute episode \n taking medication as prescribed \n talking to others about the condition \n \n There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people\u00a0find it comforting\u00a0talking to others with a similar condition. \n Read more about  living with schizophrenia .", "symptoms": "Changes in thinking and behaviour are the most obvious signs of schizophrenia, but people can experience symptoms in different ways. \n The symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into one of two categories\u00a0\u2013\u00a0positive or negative. \n \n positive symptoms \u2013 represent a change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions \n negative symptoms \u2013 represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apathetic \n \n The condition\u00a0may develop slowly. The first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping patterns, can be hard to identify. This is because the first symptoms often develop during adolescence and changes can be mistaken for an adolescent \"phase\". \n People often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no positive symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia. \n If you are experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible.\u00a0The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be. \n Read more information about  how schizophrenia is diagnosed . \n Positive symptoms of schizophrenia \n Hallucinations \n A hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is\u00a0nothing or\u00a0nobody there to account for it. It can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices. \n Hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them\u00a0cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations. \n Research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people\u00a0with schizophrenia\u00a0when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices. \n Some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or\u00a0annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer's thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or\u00a0one place in particular, such as the television. \n Delusions \n A delusion is a belief\u00a0held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way people behave. Delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months. \n Some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions. \n Someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe\u00a0they are being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend. \n Some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe\u00a0people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street. \n Confused thoughts (thought disorder) \n People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme. \n People sometimes describe their thoughts as \"misty\" or \"hazy\" when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand. \n Changes in behaviour and thoughts \n A person's behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. People with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason. \n Some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else. \n Another recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions. \n Negative symptoms of schizophrenia \n The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often\u00a0appear several years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode. These initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia. \n Symptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. They include becoming more socially withdrawn and experiencing an increasing lack of care about your appearance and personal hygiene. \n It can be difficult to tell whether the symptoms are part of the development of schizophrenia or caused by something else. Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia include: \n \n losing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex\u00a0 \n lack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns\u00a0 \n being less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to say \n \n The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family because they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness.", "causes": "The exact causes of schizophrenia are unknown, but research suggests that a combination of physical, genetic, psychological and environmental factors can make people more likely to develop the condition. \n Current thinking is that some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode. However, it's not known why some people develop symptoms while others don't. \n Increased risk \n Things that increase the chances of schizophrenia developing include: \n Genetics \n Schizophrenia tends to run in families, but no\u00a0one gene is thought to be responsible. It's more likely\u00a0that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn't necessarily mean you will develop schizophrenia. \n Evidence the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. Identical twins share the same genes. In\u00a0identical twins, if one twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a one in two chance of developing it too. This is true even if they are raised separately.\u00a0 \n In non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when one twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a one in seven chance of developing the condition. \n While this is higher than in the general population (where the chance is about 1 in a 100), it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia. \n Brain development \n Studies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains. These changes aren't seen in everyone with schizophrenia and\u00a0can occur in people who don't have a mental illness. But they suggest\u00a0schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain. \n Neurotransmitters \n These are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells. There is a connection between neurotransmitters and schizophrenia because drugs that alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain are known to relieve some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.\u00a0 \n Research suggests\u00a0schizophrenia may be caused by a change in the level of two neurotransmitters: dopamine and serotonin. Some studies indicate\u00a0an imbalance between the two may be the basis of the problem. Others have found a change in the body's sensitivity to the neurotransmitters is part of the cause of schizophrenia. \n Pregnancy and birth complications \n Research has shown that people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as a low birth weight, premature labour, or a lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during birth. It may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development. \n Triggers \n Triggers are things that can cause schizophrenia to develop in people who are at risk. These include: \n Stress \n The main psychological triggers of schizophrenia are stressful life events, such as a bereavement, losing your job or home, a divorce or the end of a relationship, or physical, sexual, emotional or racial abuse. These kinds of experiences, though stressful, do not cause schizophrenia, but can trigger its development in someone already vulnerable to it. \n Drug abuse \n Drugs do not directly cause schizophrenia, but studies have shown drug misuse increases the risk of developing schizophrenia or a similar illness. \n Certain drugs, particularly cannabis, cocaine, LSD\u00a0or amphetamines, may trigger symptoms of schizophrenia in people who are susceptible. Using amphetamines or cocaine can lead to psychosis and can cause a relapse in people recovering from an earlier episode. \n Three major studies have shown teenagers under 15 who use cannabis regularly, especially \"skunk\" and other more potent forms of the drug, are up to four times more likely to develop schizophrenia by the age of 26. \n Want to know more? \n \n Mind:  mental health effects of street drugs  \n Mind:\u00a0 what causes schizophrenia?  \n Rethink Mental Illness:  causes of schizophrenia  \n Royal College of Psychiatrists:  cannabis and mental health", "treatment": "Community mental health teams \n Most people with schizophrenia are treated by community mental health teams (CMHTs). The goal of the CMHT is to provide\u00a0day-to-day support and treatment while ensuring you have as much independence as possible. \n A CMHT can be made up of and provide access to: \n \n social workers \n community mental health nurses\u00a0\u2013 a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions \n occupational therapists \n pharmacists \n counsellors and psychotherapists\u00a0 \n psychologists and psychiatrists\u00a0\u2013 the psychiatrist is usually the senior clinician in the team \n \n After your first episode of schizophrenia, you should initially be referred to an early intervention team.\u00a0These specialist teams provide treatment and support, and are usually made up of psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, social workers and support workers. \n Care programme approach (CPA) \n People with complex mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia, are usually entered into a treatment process known as a care programme approach (CPA). A CPA is essentially a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. \n There are four stages to a CPA: \n \n assessment \u2013 your health and social needs are assessed \n care plan \u2013\u00a0a care plan is created to meet your health and social needs \n care co-ordinator\u00a0appointed \u2013 a\u00a0care co-ordinator, sometimes known as a key worker, is usually a social worker or nurse, and is your first point of contact with other members of the CMHT \n reviews \u2013\u00a0your treatment will be regularly reviewed and, if needed, changes to the care plan can be agreed \n \n Not everyone uses the CPA. Some people may be cared for by their GP, while others may be under the care of a specialist. \n You will work together with your healthcare team to develop a care plan. The care plan may involve an advance statement or crisis plan, which can be followed in an emergency. \n Your care plan should include\u00a0a combined healthy eating and physical activity programme and, if you smoke,\u00a0support\u00a0for giving up.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Your care co-ordinator will be responsible for making sure all members of your healthcare team, including your GP, have a copy of your care plan. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Rethink Mental Illness: Care programme approach fact sheet (PDF, 483kb)  \n \n Acute episodes \n People who have serious psychotic symptoms as\u00a0the result of an acute schizophrenic episode may require a more intensive level of care than a CMHT can provide. \n These episodes are usually dealt with by antipsychotic medication and special care. \n Crisis resolution teams (CRT) \n One treatment option is to contact a home treatment or crisis resolution team (CRT). CRTs treat people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric crisis. Without the involvement of the CRT, these people would require treatment in hospital. \n The CRT aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. This can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre. \n CRTs are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis from occurring. \n Your care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis. \n Voluntary and compulsory detention \n More serious acute schizophrenic episodes may require admission to a psychiatric ward at a hospital or clinic. You can admit yourself voluntarily to hospital if your psychiatrist agrees it is necessary. \n People can also be compulsorily detained at a hospital under the  Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015 . It is only possible for someone to be compulsorily detained at a hospital if they have a severe mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and if detention is necessary:\u00a0 \n \n in the interests of the person's own health and safety \n to\u00a0protect others \n \n People with schizophrenia who are compulsorily detained may need to be kept in locked wards. \n All people being treated in hospital will stay only as long as is absolutely necessary\u00a0for them to\u00a0receive appropriate treatment and arrange aftercare. \n An independent panel will regularly review your case and progress. Once they feel you are no longer a danger to yourself and others, you will be discharged from hospital. However, your care team may recommend\u00a0you remain in hospital voluntarily. \n Advance statements \n If it is felt there is a significant risk of future acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, you may want to write an advance statement. \n An advance statement is a series of written instructions about what you would like your family or friends to do in case you experience another acute schizophrenic episode. You may also want to include\u00a0contact details for your care co-ordinator. \n If you want to make an advance statement, talk to your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP. \n Want to know more? \n \n Mind:  community care and aftercare \u00a0 \n \n Antipsychotics \n Antipsychotics are usually recommended as the initial treatment for\u00a0the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic episode. They work by blocking the effect\u00a0of the chemical dopamine\u00a0on the brain. \n Antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but\u00a0may take several days or weeks to reduce other symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts. \n It's important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you. \n Antipsychotics can be taken orally (as a pill) or given as an injection (known as a depot). Several slow-release antipsychotics are available.\u00a0These require you to have\u00a0one injection every two to four weeks. \n You may only need\u00a0antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed. However, most people take medication for one or two years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent. \n There are two main types of antipsychotics: \n \n typical antipsychotics \u2013 the first generation of antipsychotics\u00a0developed during the 1950s \n atypical antipsychotics \u2013 newer-generation antipsychotics\u00a0developed in the 1990s \n \n The choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects. \n Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person. \n The side effects of typical antipsychotics include: \n \n shaking \n trembling \n muscle twitches \n muscle spasms \n \n Side effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include: \n \n drowsiness\u00a0 \n weight gain, particularly with some atypical antipsychotics \n blurred vision \n constipation \n lack of sex drive \n dry mouth \n \n Tell your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist\u00a0or GP if your side effects become severe. There may be an alternative antipsychotic you can take or additional medicines\u00a0that will help you deal with the side effects. \n If you do not benefit from one antipsychotic medication after taking it regularly for several weeks, an alternative can be tried. It is important that you work with your treatment team to find the right one for you. \n Do not stop taking your antipsychotics without first consulting your care co-ordinator, psychiatrist or GP.\u00a0If you stop taking them,\u00a0you could\u00a0have a relapse of symptoms. \n Your medication should be reviewed at least once a year. \n Want to know more? \n \n Mind:  antipsychotics \u00a0 \n Royal College of Psychiatrists:  depot medication  \n \n Psychological treatment \n Psychological treatment can help people with schizophrenia cope with the symptoms of hallucinations or delusions better. They can also help treat some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as apathy or a lack of enjoyment. \n Psychological treatments for schizophrenia work best when they are combined with antipsychotic medication. Common psychological treatments include: \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you identify the thinking patterns that are causing you to have unwanted feelings and behaviour, and learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and useful thoughts. \n For example, you may be taught to recognise examples of delusional thinking. You may then receive help and advice about how to avoid acting on these thoughts. \n Most people will require\u00a0between 8 and 20 sessions of CBT over the space of\u00a06 to 12 months. CBT sessions usually last for about an hour. \n Your GP or care co-ordinator should be able to arrange a referral to a CBT therapist. \n Family therapy \n Many people with schizophrenia rely on family members for their care and support. While most family members are happy to help, caring for somebody with schizophrenia can place a strain on any family. \n Family therapy is a way of helping you and your family cope better with your condition. It involves a series of informal meetings\u00a0over a period of around six months. Meetings may include: \n \n discussing information about schizophrenia \n exploring ways of supporting somebody with schizophrenia \n deciding how to solve practical problems that can be caused by the symptoms of schizophrenia \n \n If you think you and your family could benefit from family therapy, speak to\u00a0your care co-ordinator or GP. \n Arts therapy \n Arts therapies are designed to promote creative expression. Working with an arts therapist in a small group or individually can allow you to express your experiences with schizophrenia. \n Some people find expressing things in a non-verbal way through the arts can provide a new experience of schizophrenia and help them develop new ways of relating to others. \n Arts therapies have been shown to alleviate the negative symptoms of schizophrenia in some people. \n NICE recommends\u00a0that arts therapies are provided by an arts therapist\u00a0registered with the\u00a0 Health and Care Professions Council  who has experience of working with people with schizophrenia. \n Want to know more? \n \n Mind:  understanding talking treatments", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "There is no single test for schizophrenia. The condition is usually diagnosed after assessment by a specialist in mental health. \n If you are concerned\u00a0you may be developing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be. \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms and check they are not the result of other causes, such as recreational drug use. \n Community mental health team (CMHT) \n If a diagnosis of schizophrenia is suspected, your GP should refer you promptly to your local community mental health team (CMHT). \n CMHTs are made up of different mental health professionals who support people with complex mental health conditions. \n A member of the CMHT team, usually a psychiatrist or a specialist nurse, will carry out a more detailed assessment of your symptoms. They will also want to know your personal history and current circumstances. \n To make a diagnosis, most mental healthcare professionals use a diagnostic checklist. Schizophrenia can usually be diagnosed if: \n \n you have experienced one or more of the following symptoms most of the time for a month\u00a0\u2013\u00a0delusions, hallucinations,\u00a0hearing voices, incoherent speech\u00a0or negative symptoms, such as a flattening of emotions \n your symptoms have had a significant impact on your ability to work, study or perform daily tasks \n all other possible causes, such as recreational drug use or bipolar disorder, have been ruled out \n \n Related illnesses \n Sometimes it might not be clear whether someone has schizophrenia. If you have other symptoms at the same time, a psychiatrist may have reason to believe you have a related mental illness. \n There are several\u00a0related mental illnesses similar to schizophrenia. Your psychiatrist will ask\u00a0how your illness has affected you so they can confidently confirm you have schizophrenia and not another mental illness, such as: \n \n  bipolar disorder  (manic depression) \u2013\u00a0people with bipolar disorder swing from periods of mania (elevated moods and extremely active, excited behaviour) to periods of deep depression; some people also hear voices or experience other kinds of hallucinations, or may have delusions \n schizoaffective disorder \u2013\u00a0this is often described as a form of schizophrenia because its symptoms are similar to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but schizoaffective disorder is a mental illness in its own right; it may occur just once in a person's life or\u00a0recur intermittently, often when triggered by stress. \n \n You should also be assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions,\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0depression, anxiety and substance misuse.\u00a0 \n Getting help for someone else \n As a result of\u00a0their delusional thought patterns, people with schizophrenia may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there is nothing wrong with them. \n It is likely\u00a0someone who has had acute schizophrenic episodes in the past will have been assigned a care co-ordinator. If this is the case, contact the person's care co-ordinator to express your concerns. \n If someone is having an acute schizophrenic episode for the first time, it may be necessary for a friend, relative or other loved one to persuade them to visit their GP. \n In the case of a rapidly worsening schizophrenic episode, you may need to go to the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department, where a duty psychiatrist will be available. \n If a person who is having an acute schizophrenic episode refuses to seek help, their nearest relative can request that a mental health assessment is carried out. The social services department of your local authority can advise\u00a0how to do this. \n In severe cases of schizophrenia, people can be compulsorily detained in hospital for assessment and treatment\u00a0under the  Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015 . \n After diagnosis \n If you or a friend or relative are diagnosed with schizophrenia, you may feel anxious about what will happen. You may be worried about the stigma attached to the condition, or feel frightened and withdrawn. \n It is important to remember that a diagnosis can be a positive step towards getting good, straightforward information about the illness and the kinds of treatment and services available."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Rosacea", "introduction": "Rosacea is a common but poorly understood long-term skin condition that mainly affects the face. \n It can be controlled to\u00a0some degree with long-term treatment, but sometimes the changes in\u00a0physical appearance can have\u00a0a significant psychological impact. \n Symptoms of rosacea \n Symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing,\u00a0where the skin turns red for a short period, but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as: \n \n burning and stinging sensations \n permanent redness \n spots (papules and pustules) \n small blood vessels in the skin becoming visible \n \n Rosacea is a relapsing condition, which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad, but less severe at others. \n Read about the  symptoms of rosacea  \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you have persistent symptoms that could be caused by rosacea. Early diagnosis and\u00a0treatment can help stop the condition getting worse. \n There's no specific test for rosacea, but your GP will often be able to diagnose the condition by: \n \n examining your skin \n asking about your symptoms \n asking about possible triggers you may have \n \n In some circumstances your GP may arrange further tests\u00a0to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as  lupus \u00a0or the  menopause . For example, these could be a  blood test \u00a0or\u00a0skin  biopsy,  where a small scraping of skin is removed and examined. \n Causes of rosacea \n The exact\u00a0cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of possible factors have been suggested, including abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face and a reaction to microscopic mites commonly found on the face. \n Although they're not thought to be direct causes of the condition, several triggers have been identified that may make rosacea worse. \n These include: \n \n exposure to sunlight \n stress \n strenuous exercise \n hot or cold weather \n hot drinks \n alcohol and caffeine \n certain foods, such as spicy foods \n \n Read about  causes of rosacea  \n Treating rosacea \n There's currently no cure for rosacea, but treatment can help control the symptoms. \n Long-term treatment\u00a0is usually necessary, although there may be periods when your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily. \n For most people, treatment involves a combination of self-help measures and medication, such as: \n \n avoiding known triggers \u2013 for example, avoiding drinks containing alcohol or caffeine \n creams and gels \u2013 medications applied directly to the skin to reduce spots and redness \n oral medications \u2013 tablets or capsules that can\u00a0help clear up more severe spots, such as oral  antibiotics  \n \n In some cases procedures such as laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment may be helpful.\u00a0These involve\u00a0beams of light\u00a0being aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin to shrink them and make them less visible. \n Read about more about\u00a0 treating rosacea \u00a0and\u00a0 self-help measures for rosacea  \n Living with rosacea \n Any long-term (chronic) condition can have an adverse psychological effect, but rosacea can be particularly troublesome\u00a0as it affects your appearance. This can change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others. \n Many people with rosacea have reported feelings of low self-esteem, embarrassment and frustration. \n It's important to try to come to terms with the fact you have a chronic condition that, although incurable, is controllable. \n Persevering with your treatment plan and avoiding your individual triggers are the best ways of controlling your symptoms. \n As your physical symptoms improve, you\u00a0may start to feel better psychologically and emotionally. \n If you have rosacea, take comfort in knowing you're not alone. There are millions of people living with the condition\u00a0in the UK and across the world. \n You can find support and information from organisations such as: \n \n  Changing Faces \u00a0\u2013 a charity for people with facial disfigurements, who can be contacted on\u00a00300 012 0275 for counselling and advice \n \n Speak to your GP if you're feeling\u00a0 depressed  as a result of your condition. They may recommend further treatment if necessary. \n Ocular rosacea \n Rosacea that affects your eyes (ocular rosacea) can lead to a number of eye problems, some of which can be serious. \n Symptoms of ocular rosacea can include: \n \n feeling like there is something in your eyes \n dry eyes \n irritated and bloodshot eyes \n inflammation of the eyelids (blepharitis) \n \n Rosacea can sometimes cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of the eyeball, to become inflamed and damaged. This is known as keratitis. \n This damage can make the cornea vulnerable to ulceration and infection, which could potentially threaten your sight. \n Symptoms of serious problems with your corneas include: \n \n eye pain \n sensitivity to light (photophobia) \n deterioration in your vision \n \n Contact your GP immediately if you think you may have a problem with your corneas. If this isn't possible, visit  your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department . \n If keratitis isn't treated promptly by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions, there's a risk of permanent vision loss.", "symptoms": "Rosacea causes a range of symptoms, although not everyone will experience them all. \n Most people with rosacea have periods when their symptoms are particularly troublesome, followed by periods\u00a0when their symptoms are less so. \n The main symptoms of rosacea include: \n \n flushing \n persistent facial redness \n visible blood vessels \n papules and pustules \n thickened skin \n \n These are discussed in more detail below. \n Other symptoms associated with rosacea include: \n \n sensitive skin\u00a0\u2013 burning, itching, stinging and\u00a0pain \n dry, rough skin \n raised red patches (plaques) on your skin \n facial swelling  (lymphoedema)  \n \n Permanent damage to the face (scarring) almost never occurs in rosacea. \n Flushing \n Flushing\u00a0is when your skin turns red for a short period\u00a0\u2013 usually a few minutes. It tends to mainly affect the face, although it can spread to your neck and chest. \n In some cases the redness may be accompanied by an unpleasant feeling of heat. \n In rosacea flushing\u00a0is often caused by a certain trigger, such as sun exposure, hot drinks or exercise. See\u00a0 causes of rosacea  for more information about possible triggers. \n Persistent facial redness \n Persistent facial redness (erythema) is\u00a0like\u00a0a blush or a patch of sunburn that doesn't go away, or the sort of blotchy skin often associated with drinking too much alcohol. \n This can be upsetting for those with rosacea as people can mistakenly assume they are heavy drinkers. \n The redness usually affects the cheeks, nose and chin, but may spread to other areas, such as the forehead, neck and chest. \n Visible blood vessels \n Over time the blood vessels in the skin may become permanently widened\u00a0(dilated) and visible. The medical name for visible blood vessels is telangiectasia. \n Papules and pustules \n If you have rosacea, you may develop round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings\u00a0(pustules). \n These spots appear on your face and are similar to  acne . Rosacea used to be called acne rosacea, but the 2\u00a0conditions are quite different. \n In rosacea there are no blackheads\u00a0and\u00a0the skin is not greasy, but dry and peeling. Rosacea spots also don't cause scarring. \n Thickened skin \n In the most serious cases of rosacea the skin can thicken and form excess tissue, usually around the nose. This causes the nose to take on a large, bulbous appearance (rhinophyma). \n Rhinophyma is an uncommon,\u00a0severe\u00a0symptom of rosacea and takes several years to develop. It\u00a0almost exclusively affects men.", "causes": "The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of potential factors have been suggested. \n It's possible a combination of these factors may be responsible for the condition, although there isn't enough evidence to say this for certain. \n Some of the main factors that have been suggested are outlined below. \n Blood vessel abnormalities \n Some experts believe abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face may be a major contributing factor for rosacea. This may explain symptoms of flushing, persistent redness and visible blood vessels. \n It's not known what causes these abnormalities. But sun damage may be responsible for degeneration of the elastic tissue of the skin and the dilation of blood vessels. \n Skin peptides \n Recent research has shown external triggers such as ultraviolet (UV) light, spicy food, alcohol (particularly red wine), exercise, stress, heat and cold can lead to the\u00a0activation of certain molecules within the skin called peptides. \n Increased levels of these peptides may in turn affect the immune system or\u00a0nerves and blood vessels\u00a0(neurovascular system) of the skin. Activation of these systems can cause dilation of blood vessels, redness and inflammation. \n Microscopic mites \n Microscopic mites called demodex folliculorum usually live harmlessly on human skin, but people with rosacea have particularly large numbers, which may play a role in the condition. \n It is currently uncertain whether the mite is a cause or an effect of rosacea, although some\u00a0researchers have suggested the symptoms may be caused by the skin reacting to\u00a0bacteria in the mites' faeces. \n Helicobacter pylori bacteria \n Helicobacter pylori bacteria are bacteria\u00a0found in the digestive system. It's been suggested these bacteria may be a possible cause of rosacea, although\u00a0a link\u00a0hasn't been proven. \n One theory is the bacteria may stimulate the production of a protein called bradykinin, which is known to cause blood vessels to expand. \n Genetics \n Rosacea seems to be more common in families, although it's not clear which genes\u00a0\u2013 if any\u00a0\u2013 are involved or how they're passed on. \n Triggers of rosacea \n Although they're not thought to be direct causes of\u00a0the condition, many people with rosacea find certain triggers make their symptoms worse. \n Different people can have different triggers, but triggers that have been commonly reported include: \n \n exposure to sunlight \n stress \n hot or cold weather \n strong\u00a0winds \n strenuous exercise \n  alcohol  \n hot baths \n spicy foods \n hot drinks \n humidity \n caffeine\u00a0\u2013 found in tea, coffee and cola \n the  menopause  \n dairy products \n other\u00a0medical conditions \n certain medicines\u00a0\u2013 such as amiodarone,  corticosteroids  and high doses of vitamins B6 and B12", "treatment": "Although rosacea can't be cured, treatment can help keep the symptoms under control. \n Long-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods where your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily. \n Treatment choices depend on\u00a0which type of symptom is most troublesome, but usually involves a combination of\u00a0self-help measures and medication, and are\u00a0outlined below.\u00a0 \n Self-help measures \n There are a number of\u00a0things you can do yourself to help keep the symptoms of rosacea under control, including: \n \n avoiding things that trigger your symptoms \u2013 for example, by using sun cream and covering yourself up if direct sunlight makes your symptoms worse \n taking good care of your skin \u2013 for example, by\u00a0using\u00a0products suitable for sensitive skin \n using make-up \u2013\u00a0patches of persistent red skin can be disguised using specially designed camouflage make-up \n keeping your eyelids clean \u2013 if rosacea is causing your eyelids to become inflamed (blepharitis) \n \n Treating papules and pustules \n If you have\u00a0round red bumps that rise from your skin (papules) and pus-filled swellings (pustules) caused by rosacea, there are a number of different medications that can be effective. \n These can be divided into topical treatments that are applied to the skin, or oral treatments, which are taken by mouth. \n Topical treatments \n Topical medications are usually prescribed first. These include: \n \n metronidazole cream or gel \n azelaic acid cream or gel \n ivermectin cream \n \n Ivermectin is a relatively new medicine. There's some evidence to suggest it may be more effective and perhaps less irritating to the skin than metronidazole, although it's not currently available on the NHS everywhere and may only be recommended if the other treatments don't work. \n You'll usually need to apply these topical treatments once or twice a day, taking care not to get them in your eyes or mouth. It may be several weeks before you notice any significant improvement in your symptoms. \n Side effects of these treatments can include a burning or stinging sensation, itchiness and dry skin. \n Oral antibiotics \n If your symptoms are more severe, an oral  antibiotic  medication may be recommended as these can help reduce\u00a0inflammation of the skin. \n Antibiotics often used to treat rosacea include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline and erythromycin.\u00a0 \n These medications are usually taken for 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks, but longer courses may be necessary if the spots are persistent. \n For example, a low-dose doxycycline capsule is available if oral antibiotics need to be taken long term. \n Common side effects of these medications include: \n \n feeling and being sick \n  diarrhoea  \n bloating and\u00a0 indigestion  \n  tummy (abdominal)\u00a0pain  \n loss of appetite \n \n Some of the medications used can also\u00a0make your skin sensitive to sunlight and artificial sources of light, such as sun lamps and sunbeds. \n As with the topical treatments mentioned above, these medications usually need to be taken\u00a0once or twice a day and you may not notice a significant improvement in your symptoms for several weeks. \n Oral\u00a0isotretinoin \n Isotretinoin is a medicine often used to treat severe  acne ,\u00a0but at lower doses it's also occasionally used to treat rosacea. \n As isotretinoin is a strong medication that can cause a range of side effects, it can only be prescribed by a\u00a0specialist\u00a0in treating skin conditions (dermatologist) and not your GP. \n Common side effects of isotretinoin include: \n \n dryness and cracking of the skin, lips and nostrils \n inflammation of your eyelids (blepharitis) or\u00a0eyes  (conjunctivitis)  \n  headaches  \n muscle or\u00a0joint pain \n back pain \n blood in your urine (haematuria) \n mood changes \n \n Isotretinion can also cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. \n Treating facial redness \n Treating\u00a0facial redness and\u00a0flushing caused by rosacea\u00a0is generally more difficult than treating papules and pustules caused by the condition.\u00a0 \n But as well as\u00a0the self-help measures mentioned above, there are some medications that can help. \n Brimonidine tartrate \n Brimonidine tartrate is a relatively new medication for facial redness caused by rosacea. It comes in the form of a\u00a0gel that's applied to the face once a day. \n The medication works by restricting the widening (dilation) of the blood vessels in your face. Research\u00a0has shown it can start to have an effect about 30 minutes after it's first used, and this can last for around 12 hours. \n Common side effects of\u00a0brimonidine tartrate include itchiness and a burning sensation where the gel is applied. \n Less common side effects can include: \n \n a dry mouth \n headaches \n pins and needles \n dry skin \n \n A rebound effect, where flushing becomes worse, has also been reported with this medication. \n Oral treatments \n Alternatively, there are a number of oral medications that may help improve redness caused by rosacea. \n These include: \n \n clonidine\u00a0\u2013 a medication that relaxes the blood vessels \n  beta-blockers \u00a0\u2013 medications that decrease the activity of the heart \n anxiety medications\u00a0\u2013 medications sometimes used to help calm the person and reduce blushing\u00a0 \n \n It's not clear how effective these medications are at treating redness caused by rosacea, but they may sometimes be prescribed under the supervision of a dermatologist. \n Laser and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment \n Redness and visible blood vessels (telangiectasia) can also sometimes be successfully improved with vascular laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment. These treatments may also improve flushing. \n A referral to a dermatologist is usually required before having these treatments and they're not usually available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for them privately. Around 2\u00a0to 4\u00a0treatments may be needed, so the overall cost may be significant. \n Laser and IPL machines produce narrow beams of light that are aimed at the visible blood vessels in the skin. The heat from the lasers damages the dilated veins and causes them to shrink so they're no longer visible, with minimal scarring or damage to the\u00a0surrounding area. \n Laser treatment can cause pain, but most people don't need an anaesthetic. Side effects of laser treatment are usually mild and can include: \n \n bruising \n crusting of the skin \n swelling and redness of the skin \n  blisters \u00a0(in rare cases) \n infection (in very rare cases) \n \n These side effects usually only last a few days and are rarely permanent. \n Treating thickened skin \n In some people with rosacea the skin of the nose can become thickened. This is known as\u00a0rhinophyma. \n If you have severe rhinophyma, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to\u00a0discuss\u00a0ways the appearance of your skin can be improved. \n A number of surgical treatments are available to remove any excess tissue and remodel the nose into a more pleasing shape. \n This may be done with a\u00a0laser, a scalpel or specially designed abrasive instruments using a technique called dermabrasion. \n Treating eye problems \n If rosacea\u00a0is affecting your eyes (ocular rosacea), you may require further treatment.\u00a0 \n For example, you may need to use lubricating eye drops or ointment if you have dry eyes, or oral antibiotics if you have blepharitis. \n If\u00a0initial treatment isn't\u00a0effective or you develop any further problems with your eyes, you'll need to be referred to an eye specialist called an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

This means that your immune system \u2013 which usually fights infection \u2013 attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful. \n Over time, this can damage the joint itself, the cartilage and nearby bone. \n It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, although you are at an increased risk if you are a woman, you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis, or you smoke. \n Read more about the  causes of rheumatoid arthritis . \n Who is affected \n Rheumatoid arthritis affects around 400,000 people in the UK. \n It can affect adults at any age, but most commonly starts between the ages of 40 and 50. About three times as many women as men are affected. \n How\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis is treated \n There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with rheumatoid arthritis to have periods of months or even years between flares and to be able to lead full lives and continue regular employment. \n The main treatment options include: \n \n medication that is taken in the long-term to relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the condition \n supportive treatments, such as physiotherapy\u00a0and occupational therapy, to help keep you mobile and find ways around any problems you have with daily activities \n surgery to correct any joint problems that develop\u00a0 \n \n Read more about  treating rheumatoid arthritis . \n Possible complications \n Having rheumatoid arthritis can lead to several other conditions that may cause additional symptoms and can sometimes be life-threatening. \n Possible complications include carpal tunnel syndrome, inflammation of other areas of the body (such as the lungs, heart and eyes), and an increased risk of  heart attacks  and  strokes . \n Ensuring that rheumatoid arthritis is well controlled helps reduce your risk of complications such as these. \n Read more about the  complications of rheumatoid arthritis .", "symptoms": "Rheumatoid arthritis mainly affects the joints, although it can cause problems in other parts of the body too. \n The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis often develop gradually over several weeks, but some cases can progress quickly over a number of days. \n The symptoms vary from person to person. They can come and go, and may change over time. You\u00a0may occasionally experience flares when your condition deteriorates and your symptoms become more severe. \n Symptoms affecting the joints \n Rheumatoid arthritis is primarily a condition that affects the joints. It can cause problems in any joint in the body, although the small joints in the hands and feet are often the first to be affected. \n Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the joints symmetrically (both sides of the body at the same time and to the same extent), but this is not always the case. \n The main symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the joints are outlined below. \n Pain \n The\u00a0joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0is usually a throbbing and\u00a0aching pain. It is often worse in the mornings and after a period of inactivity. \n Stiffness \n Joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis can feel stiff. For example, if your hands are affected, you may not be able to fully bend your fingers or form a fist. \n Like joint pain, the stiffness\u00a0is often\u00a0more severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Morning stiffness associated with another type of arthritis called\u00a0 osteoarthritis  usually wears off within 30 minutes of getting up, but rheumatoid arthritis morning stiffness often\u00a0lasts longer than this. \n Swelling, warmth and redness \n The lining of\u00a0joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis become inflamed, which can cause the joints to swell, and become hot and tender to touch. \n In some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules can also develop under the skin around affected joints. \n Additional symptoms \n As well as problems affecting the joints, some people with rheumatoid arthritis experience a range of more general symptoms, such as: \n \n tiredness and a lack of energy \n a high temperature (fever) \n sweating \n a poor appetite \n weight loss \n \n The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis can also sometimes cause problems affecting other areas of the body, including\u00a0dry eyes if the eyes are affected and\u00a0chest pain if the heart or lungs are affected. Read more about the  complications of rheumatoid arthritis . \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. \n There are a number of conditions that can cause problems such as joint pain and stiffness, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis. \n Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis as soon as possible is particularly important because early treatment can help\u00a0stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of\u00a0further problems such as joint damage. \n Read more about  diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis .", "causes": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by the body\u2019s immune system attacking itself. However, it is not yet known what triggers this. \n Normally, your immune system makes antibodies that attack bacteria and viruses, helping fight infection.\u00a0But if you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly sends antibodies to the lining of your joints, where they attack the tissue surrounding the joint. \n This causes the thin layer of cells (synovium) covering your joints to become sore and inflamed. \n This inflammation in turn causes chemicals to be released that thicken the synovium and damage nearby: \n \n bones \n cartilage \u2013 the stretchy connective tissue between bones \n tendons \u2013 the tissue that connects bone to muscle \n ligaments \u2013 the tissue that connects bone and cartilage \n \n If the condition is not treated, these chemicals gradually cause the joint to lose its shape and alignment and, eventually, can destroy the joint completely. \n Various theories of why the immune system starts to attack the joints have been suggested, including that an infection or\u00a0virus may trigger this, but none of these theories has been proven. \n Possible risk factors \n There are a number of things that may increase your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including: \n \n your genes \u2013\u00a0there is some evidence that rheumatoid arthritis can run in families, although the risk of inheriting the condition is thought to be low as genes are only thought to play a small role in the condition \n hormones \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis is more common in women than men, which may be due to the effects of a hormone called oestrogen that is found at higher levels in women, although this has not been conclusively proven \n smoking \u2013 some evidence suggests that people who smoke are at an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis \n \n Want to know more? \n \n National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS):  Possible causes and risk factors", "treatment": "Stopping the condition progressing \n There are a number of medications available that can be used to help stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse and reduce your risk of further problems. \n These are often divided into two types of medication: 'disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)' and 'biological treatments'. \n Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \n If you have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, you will normally be offered a combination of DMARD tablets as part of your initial treatment, as\u00a0these medications are particularly effective in\u00a0easing symptoms of the condition and slowing down its progression. \n DMARDs work by\u00a0blocking the effects of the chemicals released when the immune system attacks the joints, which could otherwise\u00a0cause further damage to nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage. \n There are many different DMARDs that can be used, including methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. \n Methotrexate is\u00a0normally the first\u00a0medicine given for rheumatoid arthritis, often alongside another DMARD and\u00a0a short-course of corticosteroids to relieve any\u00a0pain (see\u00a0below). It may also be combined with the biological treatments mentioned\u00a0below. \n Common side effects of methotrexate include feeling sick, loss of appetite, a sore mouth,  diarrhoea ,\u00a0 headaches  and hair loss.\u00a0The medication\u00a0can also sometimes have an effect on your blood count and your liver,\u00a0so you will have regular  blood tests  to monitor this. \n Less commonly, methotrexate can affect the lungs, so you will usually have a chest  X-ray  and possibly breathing tests when you start taking methotrexate, to provide a comparison if you develop\u00a0 shortness of breath  or a persistent dry\u00a0 cough  while taking it. However, most people tolerate methotrexate well. \n It can take a few months to notice a DMARD working. It is important to keep taking the medication, even if you do not notice it working at first. \n You may have to try two or three types of DMARD before you find the one that is most suitable for you. Once you and your doctor work out the most suitable DMARD, you will usually have to take the medicine in the long term. \n Biological treatments \n Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. They include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, rituximab, abatacept and tocilizumab. \n They are usually taken in combination with methotrexate or another DMARD and are normally only used if these medications alone have not been effective. \n Biological medications are given by injection and they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating your immune system to attack your joints. \n Side effects from biological treatments are usually mild and include skin reactions at the site of the injections, infections, feeling sick, a high temperature (fever) and headaches. \n Some people may also\u00a0be at risk of getting more serious problems, including the reactivation of infections such as  tuberculosis (TB) \u00a0in people who have had them in the past. \n Want to know more? \n \n National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS):\u00a0 Treatment  \n Arthritis Care:  Taking medication  \n NICE:\u00a0 Abatacept for treating rheumatoid arthritis  \n NICE:\u00a0 Golimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  \n NICE:\u00a0 Certolizumab pegol for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  \n NICE:\u00a0 Tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  \n NICE:\u00a0 Adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, rituximab and abatacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  \n \n Relieving pain \n In addition to the medications used to control the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, you may also need to take medication specifically to relieve pain. \n Some of the different medicines that\u00a0may be used to relieve pain\u00a0are outlined below. \n Painkillers \n In some cases, you may be advised to use painkillers such as  paracetamol , or a combination of paracetamol and codeine (co-codamol) to relieve the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis. \n These medications don't help treat the underlying inflammation of your joints, but they can sometimes be helpful in relieving pain. For example, they may be recommended while you are waiting to see a specialist or during periods where your symptoms are particularly bad (flare-ups). \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n In addition to \u2013 or instead of \u2013 the painkillers mentioned above, your doctor may prescribe a  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) . \n This may be a traditional NSAID (such as  ibuprofen , naproxen or diclofenac) or an alternative type called a COX-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib or etoricoxib). \n These medications can help relieve pain while also reducing inflammation in the joints, although they will not stop rheumatoid arthritis getting worse over time. \n Your doctor will discuss with you what type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with each of them. \n Although uncommon, taking an NSAID tablet can increase the risk of serious stomach problems \u2013 such as internal bleeding \u2013 because the medications can break down the lining that protects the stomach against damage from stomach acids. \n If you are prescribed an NSAID tablet, you will often have to take another medicine, such as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), as well. Taking a PPI reduces the amount of acid in your stomach, which greatly reduces the risk of damage to your stomach lining. \n Corticosteroids \n  Corticosteroids  are powerful medications that can help reduce pain, stiffness and inflammation. \n They can be used as a tablet (for example, prednisolone), as an injection directly into a painful joint, or as an injection into the muscle (to help lots of joints). \n They are usually used to provide short-term pain relief \u2013 for example, while you are waiting for DMARD medication to take effect or during a flare-up. \n Corticosteroids are normally only used in this way because long-term use of corticosteroids can have serious side effects, such as weight gain,  osteoporosis  (thinning of the bones), easy bruising, muscle weakness and thinning of the skin. \n Want to know more? \n \n National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS):  Symptom control  \n \n Supportive treatments \n Your doctor may also refer you to other services that might be able to help you with your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. \n Physiotherapy \n A physiotherapist\u00a0may help you improve your fitness and muscle strength, and make your joints more flexible. \n They may also be able to help with pain relief using heat or ice packs, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). A TENS machine applies a small pulse of electricity to the affected joint, which\u00a0numbs the nerve endings and can help ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. \n Occupational therapy \n If rheumatoid arthritis causes you\u00a0problems with everyday tasks,\u00a0 occupational therapy  may help. \n An occupational therapist can provide training and advice that will help you to protect your joints, both while you are at home and at work. \n Some type of support for your joints, such as a splint, may also be recommended, or devices that can help\u00a0open jars or turn on taps. \n Podiatry \n If you have problems with your feet, a podiatrist may be able to help. You may also be offered some type of support for your joints or shoe insoles that can ease pain. \n Want to know more? \n \n Arthritis Care:  Occupational therapy  \n Arthritis Research UK:  Therapies  \n Arthritis Research UK:  Rheumatology team  \n National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS):\u00a0 Who can help me?  \n \n Surgery \n Sometimes, despite medication, damage to your joints may occur. In such cases, you may need surgery to help restore your ability to use your joint. \n Surgery may also be recommended to reduce pain\u00a0or correct deformities. \n Finger, hand and wrist surgery \n There are different types of surgery to correct joint problems in the hand. Examples include: \n \n carpal tunnel release (cutting a ligament in the wrist to relieve pressure on a nerve) \n release of tendons in the fingers to treat abnormal bending \n removal of inflamed tissue that lines the finger joints \n \n Arthroscopy \n  Arthroscopy  is a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue. \n During the operation, a thin tube with a light source and camera (arthroscope) is inserted into the joint through a small cut in the skin so that the surgeon can see the affected joint. \n Special surgical instruments are inserted through other small cuts in the skin to remove the damaged tissue. You usually do not have to stay overnight in hospital for this kind of surgery, but the joint will need to be rested at home for several days. \n Joint replacement \n Some people with rheumatoid arthritis will need surgery to\u00a0replace part or all of a joint, such as the hip, knee or shoulder joint. This is known as a joint replacement or arthroplasty. \n Replacement of these joints is a major operation that involves several days in hospital followed by months of rehabilitation. \n The\u00a0latest joints have a limited lifespan of 10-20 years. They are not perfect and some function may not be restored after the damaged joint is replaced by a new one.\u00a0 \n Read more about  knee replacement  and  hip replacement . \n Want to know more? \n \n Arthritis Care:  Surgery  \n Arthritis Research UK:  Arthritis surgery  \n National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS):\u00a0 Surgery  \n \n Complementary and alternative therapies \n Many people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies, such as: \n \n massage \n acupuncture \n osteopathy \n chiropractic \n \n In most cases, there is little or no evidence these are effective in the long-term, although some people may experience a short-term benefit from them. \n Nutritional supplements and dietary changes \n There is no strong evidence to suggest that specific dietary changes can help improve rheumatoid arthritis, although some people with rheumatoid arthritis feel that their symptoms get worse after they have eaten certain foods. \n If you think this may be the case for you, it may be useful to try avoiding problematic foods for a few weeks to see if your symptoms improve. However, it is important to ensure your overall diet is still healthy and balanced. \n There is also little evidence supporting the use of supplements in rheumatoid arthritis, although some can be useful in preventing side effects of medications you may be taking. For example,\u00a0calcium\u00a0and\u00a0vitamin D\u00a0supplements may help prevent osteoporosis if you are taking steroids and\u00a0folic acid supplements may help prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate. \n However, there is some evidence to suggest that taking fish oil supplements may help reduce joint pain and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis. \n Want to know more? \n \n Arthritis Care:  Complementary therapy  \n Arthritis Research UK:  Complementary and alternative medicines  \n National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS):  Diet", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation and there is no definitive test for the condition. \n You should see your GP if you have these symptoms so they can try to determine the cause. \n Seeing your GP \n Your GP will\u00a0carry out a physical examination, checking your joints for any swelling and to assess how easily they move. Your GP will also ask you about your symptoms. \n It is important to tell your GP about all\u00a0your symptoms, not just ones you think are important, as this will help\u00a0the doctor make the correct diagnosis. \n If your GP thinks you have rheumatoid arthritis,\u00a0they will refer you to a specialist (rheumatologist). \n Your GP may arrange\u00a0 blood tests  to help confirm the diagnosis after conducting a physical examination and consulting your medical history, or they may refer you at the same time as requesting tests. \n Blood tests \n No\u00a0blood test can\u00a0definitively prove or rule out a diagnosis of\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, but\u00a0a number of tests can show possible indications of the condition. Some of the main tests used\u00a0are outlined below. \n Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) \n In an ESR test, a sample of your red blood cells\u00a0is placed into a test tube of liquid. The cells are then timed to see how fast they fall to the bottom of the tube (measured in millimetres per hour). If they are sinking faster than usual, you may have an inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. \n C-reactive protein (CRP) \n A CRP test can indicate if there is inflammation anywhere in the body by checking how much CRP is present in your blood. CRP is produced by the liver. If there is more CRP than usual, there is inflammation in your body. \n Full blood count \n The full blood count will measure your red cells to rule out anaemia. Anaemia is a condition where the blood is unable to carry enough oxygen, due to a lack of blood cells. \n Anaemia is common in people with\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis, although\u00a0the problem can\u00a0have many causes, so having anaemia\u00a0does not prove that you have rheumatoid arthritis. \n Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies \n Specific blood tests can help to diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, but are not accurate in every person. About half of all people with rheumatoid arthritis have a positive rheumatoid factor present in their blood when the disease starts, but about one in every 20 people without rheumatoid arthritis also tests positive for this. \n Another antibody test known as anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide) is also available. People who test positive for anti-CCP are very likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis, but not everybody found to have rheumatoid arthritis has this antibody. \n Those who test positive for both rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP may be more likely to have severe rheumatoid arthritis requiring higher levels of treatment. \n Joint imaging \n A number of different scans may also be carried out to check for joint inflammation and damage. These can help differentiate between different types of  arthritis \u00a0and can be used to monitor how\u00a0your condition is progressing over time. \n Scans that may be carried out to diagnose and monitor rheumatoid arthritis include: \n \n  X-rays \u00a0\u2013 where radiation is passed through your body to examine your bones and joints \n  ultrasound scans \u00a0\u2013 where high frequency sound waves are used to create an image of joints \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans \u00a0\u2013 where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your joints \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Arthritis Care:  Getting a diagnosis  \n National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society:\u00a0  Making a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Scoliosis", "introduction": "Scoliosis is the abnormal twisting and curvature of the spine. \n It is usually first noticed by a change in appearance of the back. \n Typical signs include: \n \n a visibly curved spine \n one shoulder being higher than the other \n one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other \n clothes not hanging properly \n a prominent ribcage \n a difference in leg lengths \n \n Back pain\u00a0is common in adults with scoliosis. Young people with scoliosis may also experience some discomfort but it's less likely to be severe. \n Seeking medical advice \n If you or your child\u00a0have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your GP.\u00a0They can examine your back and can refer you for an  X-ray  for confirmation. \n If you or your child are diagnosed with scoliosis, it's important to see a scoliosis specialist to talk about treatment options. \n Read more about  diagnosing scoliosis . \n What causes scoliosis? \n In around\u00a0eight out of every 10 cases, a cause for scoliosis is not found. This is known as idiopathic scoliosis. \n A small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including: \n \n cerebral palsy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition\u00a0 associated with brain damage \n muscular dystrophy\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness\u00a0 \n Marfan syndrome\u00a0\u2013 a disorder of the connective tissues \n \n Rarely, babies can be born with scoliosis,\u00a0as a result of\u00a0a problem with the development of the spine in the womb. \n In adults, age related changes in the discs and joints of the spine and a reduction in bone density may cause scoliosis. Adults can also experience worsening over time of previously undiagnosed or untreated scoliosis. \n Read more\u00a0about the  causes of scoliosis . \n Who is affected \n It used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it\u2019s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well. \n It can develop\u00a0at any age, but is most common in children aged 10-15. In the UK, around three or four in every 1,000\u00a0children\u00a0need treatment for scoliosis. \n It's more common in females than males. \n How scoliosis is treated \n Treatment for scoliosis depends on your age,\u00a0how severe it is, and whether it\u2019s thought it will worsen with time. \n In very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. If treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve\u2019s progression. \n If the infant or younger child's curve continues to progress despite bracing or casting, an operation may be necessary. This will usually involve inserting metal rods into the back to stabilise the spine, which are lengthened at regular intervals as your child grows. \n In older children and adults, it is unlikely that scoliosis will improve with time, and in some it may progressively worsen. \n The main treatments for older children are: \n \n a back brace worn until they stop growing, to prevent the spine from curving further \n surgery to correct the curvature \u2013 where the spine is straightened using rods attached to the spine by screws, hooks and/or wires \n \n In adults, treatment primarily aims to relieve any pain. Non-surgical options, such as painkillers and exercises are often tried first, with correctional surgery seen as a last resort. \n Read more  about treating scoliosis in children  and  treating scoliosis in adults . \n Further problems \n Scoliosis can sometimes lead to\u00a0further emotional and physical problems. \n Having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis. \n If this is a problem for you or your child, you may find it useful to contact a scoliosis support group, such as  Scoliosis Association UK . These groups are a good source of\u00a0information and support for people with scoliosis. \n In rare cases, scoliosis can lead to physical problems if it's severe. For example, significant curvature of the spine can sometimes put increased pressure on the heart and lungs. \n Read more about the possible  complications of scoliosis .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown and it cannot usually be prevented. \n It is not\u00a0thought to be linked\u00a0with things such as bad posture, exercise or diet. \n If the cause of scoliosis is unknown,\u00a0it is called idiopathic scoliosis. About eight out of every 10 cases of scoliosis are idiopathic. \n However, researchers have found\u00a0there is\u00a0a family history of the condition in some\u00a0idiopathic cases,\u00a0which suggests\u00a0a possible genetic link. \n Idiopathic scoliosis can affect adults and children.\u00a0Some cases\u00a0may only become noticable\u00a0in later life. \n Known causes \n In a small number of cases, a cause is identified. \n Other health conditions \n Some cases of scoliosis are caused by conditions that affect the nerves and muscles (neuromuscular conditions), such as: \n \n cerebral palsy\u00a0\u2013 a condition that\u00a0affects the brain and nerves\u00a0and occurs during or shortly after birth \n muscular dystrophy\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that causes muscle weakness \n neurofibromatosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a\u00a0genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along your nerves \n \n Scoliosis can also develop as part of a pattern of symptoms called a syndrome. This is known as syndromic scoliosis. Conditions that can cause syndromic scoliosis include: \n \n Marfan syndrome \u2013 a disorder of the connective tissues inherited by a child from their parents \n Rett syndrome \u2013 a genetic disorder, usually affecting females, which causes severe physical and mental disability \n \n These conditions are usually diagnosed at a young age and children with them are often monitored for problems\u00a0such as\u00a0scoliosis. \n Birth defects \n In rare cases, babies can be born with scoliosis. This is known as congenital scoliosis. Congenital scoliosis is caused by the bones in the spine developing abnormally in the womb. \n Long-term damage \n In adults, scoliosis can sometimes be caused by gradual deterioration to the parts of the spine. This is known as degenerative scoliosis. \n This can occur because some parts of the spine become narrower and weaker ( osteoporosis ) with age.", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Scoliosis can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination of the spine, ribs, hips and shoulders. \n You may be asked to bend\u00a0forward to see if any areas are\u00a0particularly prominent. For example, one of your shoulders may be higher than the other or there may be a bulge in your back. \n Initial examinations are usually carried out by a GP. If scoliosis is suspected, you should be referred to an orthopaedic specialist (a specialist in conditions that affect the skeleton) for further tests and to discuss treatment. \n Scans \n The orthopaedic specialist will take an\u00a0 X-ray  to confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis. \n The X-ray images will also help determine the shape, direction, location and angle of the curve.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Rhabdomyosarcoma", "introduction": "Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma (tumour). Fewer than 60 children are diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma in the UK each year. Most of them are younger than 10 years old. It is more common in boys than girls. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Sarcomas \n Sarcomas are rare types of tumour that develop in the supporting tissues of the body, such as bone, muscle or cartilage. There are two main types of sarcomas: \n \n soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels, or in any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body \n bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton \n \n Rhabdomyosarcoma \n Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common of soft tissue sarcomas in children. These tumours develop from muscle or fibrous tissue and can grow in any part of the body. \n The most common areas of the body to be affected are around the head and neck, bladder, testes, womb, or vagina. \n Sometimes tumours are also found in a muscle or a limb, in the chest or in the abdominal wall. If the tumour is in the head or neck area, it can occasionally spread into the brain or the fluid around the spinal cord. \n Causes \n The causes of rhadomyosarcoma are unknown but research is going on all the time. Children with certain rare genetic disorders, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, have a higher risk of developing rhabdomyosarcoma. \n Symptoms \n The most common symptom is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that\u2019s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma: \n \n a\u00a0tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat. Occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding \n a\u00a0tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation) \n a\u00a0tumour in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine \n \n How rhabdomyosarcoma is diagnosed \n Different tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma. Your child may need a small operation to remove a sample from the tumour (a biopsy) so that it can be examined under a microscope. This is usually done under a general anaesthetic. \n Tests may be done to check the exact size of the tumour and to find out if it has spread to any other part of the body. These may include: \n \n a chest  X-ray  to check the lungs \n an  ultrasound  \n  CT  or  MRI scans  \n  blood tests  and bone marrow \n \n Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you \n Staging \n The \u2018stage\u2019 of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage helps the doctors decide on the most effective treatment for your child. \n The staging system for rhabdomyosarcoma is based on: \n \n where in the body the tumour started \n if it is in only one part of the body (localised disease), or if it has spread to another part of the body (metastatic disease). \n \n There are different ways of staging rhabdomyosarcoma, and your child\u2019s specialist doctor will explain more about the system they are using. \n Treatment \n Rhabdomyosarcomas are rare tumours and should be treated at specialist centres. Treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread. \n The three main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Your child may have a combination of treatments. \n  Chemotherapy  \n      Chemotherapy  is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be given: \n \n to shrink the tumour before surgery \n after surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming back \n \n The drugs used and the length of treatment depends on the type and stage of the rhabdomyosarcoma. \n  Surgery  \n If it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. The operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. The surgeon will explain what is involved. Chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. If an operation isn\u2019t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given. \n  Radiotherapy  \n  Radiotherapy  treats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started. \n Side effects of treatment \n The side effects will depend on the treatment being given and the part of the body that is being treated. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops. \n Chemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick,  hair loss ,  tiredness , and an increased risk of infection. But it can also make your child feel better by relieving any symptoms the tumour is causing. \n Radiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that\u2019s being treated may go red or get darker. Other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. Your child\u2019s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this. \n Late side effects \n A small number of children may develop long-term side effects many years after treatment for a rhabdomyosarcoma. This depends on the type of treatment your child had. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible risk of late side effects. Follow-up for children who\u2019ve had cancer includes close monitoring for any signs of any late effects. \n Late effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancer. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. \n Before any trial is allowed to take place, it must be approved by an ethics committee, which protects the interests of the patients taking part. If you decide to take part in a trial, your doctor or a research nurse must discuss the treatment with you so that you understand the trial and what it means for your child to take part. You may decide not to take part, or you can withdraw from a trial at any stage. You will then receive the best standard treatment available. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n After treatment, the doctors will regularly check your child to be sure that the cancer has not come back and there are no complications. After a while, you will not need to visit the clinic so often. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows their situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Retinoblastoma: Children", "introduction": "Retinoblastoma is an uncommon eye cancer that usually affects children under five, although it can affect children of any age. About 40 to 50 cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed in the UK each year. Treatment is very effective and nearly all (98 out of 100) children with retinoblastoma are cured. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Retinoblastoma \n Retinoblastoma develops in the light-sensitive lining of the eye (called the retina). \n There are two forms of retinoblastoma: \n \n a\u00a0heritable form - this is genetic or inherited. There are often tumours in both eyes (bilateral) or sometimes only in one eye. \n a\u00a0non-heritable form - this is not passed on in the family. There\u2019s one tumour in only one eye (unilateral). \u00a0 \n \n Causes of retinoblastoma \n The heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about two in every five cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. This means that an abnormal gene allows the tumour to develop. This abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb. \n Genetic counselling and support is available for families in which a member has retinoblastoma. Not all children of a parent with retinoblastoma will inherit this gene, but children born into families with a history of retinoblastoma are offered blood testing. They are also usually checked (screened) soon after birth for signs of retinoblastoma. This means that treatment can be started early if a tumour does develop. \n Screening usually starts shortly after birth and is repeated every few months for five years. An eye specialist examines the eye, while shining a light into it with an opthalmoscope. In younger children this may need to be done under a  general anaesthetic . \n The genetic abnormality in the heritable form of retinoblastoma is now well-understood. But we don\u2019t know what causes non-heritable retinoblastoma. \n Signs and symptoms \n Some children with a family history of retinoblastoma are picked up by screening before they have any symptoms. \n If there\u2019s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leucocoria). This may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. The pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph. \n Some children may have a squint or, if the tumour is large, they may have a painful red eye. \n How a retinoblastoma is diagnosed \n Tests are likely to involve an examination under anaesthetic (EUA) where an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) examines your child\u2019s eye while they\u2019re asleep. Unlike nearly all other types of cancer, retinoblastomas can be diagnosed just by their appearance. So it\u2019s not usually necessary to take a sample of tissue (a biopsy). Your child will have several more EUAs to check how treatment is progressing. \n When a retinoblastoma is diagnosed, your child may have some other tests to check the exact position and size of the tumour, and whether it has begun to spread into surrounding structures. This is known as staging. \n They may have some of the following tests: \n \n an  ultrasound scan . This is a painless scan that uses sound waves to examine the eye and the surrounding area. \n an  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan . This uses magnetism to build up a detailed picture of the eye and the head. \n a\u00a0lumbar puncture. The doctor inserts a fine needle between the bones in the lower spine to remove a sample of the fluid from around the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). The fluid is examined under a microscope to check whether there are any cancer cells present. \n a\u00a0bone marrow sample. This may be taken to check whether there are any cancer cells in the bone marrow (where our blood cells are made). The doctor inserts a needle into the hip bone and draws some of the bone marrow out with a syringe so that it can be checked for any cancer cells. \n a\u00a0bone scan. This involves taking a series of  X-rays  to check for signs of any spread to the bones. \n a\u00a0blood test. This may be taken for genetic testing for the Rb gene. The results of this test can take some months. \n \n The doctor or a specialist nurse will explain more about the tests that your child needs. \n Staging \n The stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage of your child\u2019s retinoblastoma helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment. \n The following staging system is commonly used for retinoblastoma: \n  Intraocular retinoblastoma  \n There is cancer in one or both eyes, but it has not spread to other parts of the eye or the tissues surrounding the eye. This stage may be sub-divided into five grades (A\u2013E), depending on the size and position of the cancer and on whether there\u2019s any damage to the eye. \n  Extraocular retinoblastoma  \n The cancer has spread outside the eye into surrounding tissue, or to other parts of the body. \n Treatment \n This depends on the number, position and size of the tumours in the eye. The aim of treatment is firstly to get rid of the cancer and secondly to try to keep the sight in the eye. Some treatments may cause changes to the vision in the affected eye. Your child\u2019s specialist will talk to you about the possible risks as well as the advantages of the treatment. \n Smaller tumours \n For smaller tumours, treatment is given to the eye itself (called local therapy), while your child is asleep and under anaesthetic. One of the following methods may be used: \n  Cryotherapy  \n This is used to freeze the tumours. More than one session may be necessary, in which case they are usually done at monthly intervals. \n  Laser therapy  \n A laser is used to heat the tumour. Your child may need a number of sessions at intervals of 3-4 weeks. \n  Plaque  \n A small radioactive disc is stitched over the tumour on the outside of the eye. The disc needs to stay in place for up to four days while the radiation destroys the cancer cells. This is done for slightly larger tumours, or tumours that have not been successfully treated with other methods. \n  Thermotherapy  \n This process uses heat to destroy the cancer cells and may be combined with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as heat can improve the effectiveness of these treatments. The heat is produced by a laser, which is directed at the tumour. \n Larger tumours \n These can be treated in a number of ways, including: \n  Chemotherapy  \n This is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It may be given before the local treatments mentioned above, to help shrink the tumour and make treatment more successful.  Chemotherapy  can also be used if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or if there\u2019s a risk that it may spread. The chemotherapy drugs most commonly used to treat retinoblastoma are carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine. \n Newer techniques include giving chemotherapy directly into the artery (the blood vessel) that supplies the eye (intra-arterial chemotherapy) or injecting chemotherapy into the central gelatinous part of the eye (intra-vitreal chemotherapy). \n  Surgery  \n If the tumour is very large and the vision in the eye is lost, your child is likely to need an operation to remove the eye. The specialist will only do this if it is absolutely necessary. An artificial eye is then fitted. \n  Radiotherapy  \n  Radiotherapy  treats cancer by using high energy rays from a machine to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It can be given to the whole eye but does have some effect on the surrounding tissue. Radiotherapy for retinoblastoma is normally only used when other treatments have not worked well. \n Side effects of treatment \n The side effects will depend on the treatment your child is having. The immediate side effects will usually improve when treatment finishes. But unfortunately some treatments may cause side effects that develop many years later. The specialist will explain all of this to you before treatment starts, and your child\u2019s follow- up will include checking for any long-term effects of treatment. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancers. \n If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group  (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n At least 9 out of every 10 children with retinoblastoma are cured. Following treatment, the eye specialist will frequently examine your child\u2019s eye under anaesthetic to check that the retina is healthy, the cancer has not come back, and no new tumours have developed. Follow-up is usually in a clinic for childhood cancers, called a paediatric oncology clinic. \n Children with heritable retinoblastoma will be given genetic counselling when they are old enough to understand it. \n Having the heritable form of retinoblastoma means an increased risk of developing other types of cancer later in life. Your child will be followed up closely into adulthood. They will be encouraged to get any new symptoms, such as a lump, checked early, and to have a healthy lifestyle to help to reduce cancer risk. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Retinoblastoma", "introduction": "Retinoblastoma is a rare type of eye cancer that can affect young children (usually under 5 years of age). \n If it's picked up early, retinoblastoma can often be successfully treated (children treated for retinoblastoma diagnosed at an early stage have a survival rate of more than 95%). \n Retinoblastoma can either affect one or both eyes.\u00a0If it affects both eyes, it's\u00a0usually diagnosed before a child is 1 year old. If it affects one eye, it tends to be diagnosed later (between the ages of 2 and 3). \n This page covers: \n \n  Symptoms of retinoblastoma  \n  Causes of retinoblastoma \u00a0 \n  Diagnosing retinoblastoma  \n  Treating retinoblastoma  \n  Screening for retinoblastoma  \n  Getting support  \n \n Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma \n Signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include: \n \n an unusual white reflection\u00a0in the\u00a0pupil \u2013 this may be apparent\u00a0in photos where only the healthy eye appears red from the flash, or you may notice it\u00a0in a dark or artificially lit room \n a\u00a0squint \n a change in the colour of the iris\u00a0\u2013 in one eye or sometimes only in one area of the eye\u00a0 \n a red or inflamed eye\u00a0\u2013 though\u00a0your child won't usually complain of any pain \n poor vision \u2013 your child may not focus on faces or objects, or they may not be able to control their eye movements (this is more common when both eyes are affected);\u00a0they may\u00a0say that they can't see as well as they used to \n \n These symptoms may be caused by something other than retinoblastoma. However, you should get them checked by your GP as soon as possible. \n It's unusual for retinoblastoma to progress unnoticed beyond the age of 5.\u00a0Signs in older children include\u00a0the eye appearing red, sore or swollen, and some\u00a0loss of vision in the affected eye. \n What causes retinoblastoma? \n Retinoblastoma is cancer of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive lining at the back of the eye. \n During the early stages of a baby's development, retinal eye cells grow very quickly and then stop growing. However, in rare cases, one or more cells continue to grow and form a cancer called retinoblastoma. \n In about 4 out of 10 (40%) of cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a faulty gene, which often affects both eyes (bilateral). The faulty gene\u00a0may be inherited from a parent, or a change to the gene (mutation) may occur at an early stage of the child's development in the womb. \n It's not known what causes the remaining 60% of retinoblastoma cases. In these cases, there's no faulty gene and only 1 eye is affected (unilateral). \n Around 50 to 60 children are diagnosed with retinoblastoma in the UK each year. \n Diagnosing retinoblastoma \n Your GP will carry out a\u00a0'red reflex test' in a darkened room\u00a0using an ophthalmoscope (a magnifying\u00a0instrument with\u00a0a light at one end). \n When a light is shone into your child's eyes, your GP will see a red reflection\u00a0if the retina is normal. If the reflection is white,\u00a0it may be a sign of an eye condition such as cataracts, retinal detachment\u00a0or retinoblastoma. In this case, your child\u00a0will be urgently referred (within 2 weeks) to an eye specialist for further investigation. \n The eye specialist (ophthalmologist)\u00a0will examine your child's eyes, and they may carry out another red reflex test. Eye drops will be used to increase the size of your child's pupils, allowing a clear view of the retina at the back of the eye. \n An\u00a0 ultrasound\u00a0scan  is also sometimes used to help diagnose retinoblastoma. This is a painless procedure where gel is rubbed on the outside of the eyelid and a small\u00a0ultrasound probe is placed on the eyelid, which scans the eye. \n After these investigations,\u00a0if the eye specialist thinks your child has retinoblastoma they'll refer them\u00a0to one of two specialist\u00a0retinoblastoma treatment centres,\u00a0either at\u00a0The Royal London Hospital\u00a0(RLH)\u00a0or the Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH). \n Your child's appointment should be within a week of being seen at your local eye clinic. At the specialist centre, your child will need to have a\u00a0 general anaesthetic  so their eyes can be thoroughly examined and a diagnosis of retinoblastoma can be confirmed or ruled out. \n Treating retinoblastoma \n Your child will be treated by a specialist retinoblastoma team at either the Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital. \n However, if your child needs\u00a0 chemotherapy , it will usually be carried out at a local children's cancer centre and overseen by the retinoblastoma team at 1 of the 2 specialist hospitals. \n The recommended\u00a0treatment for retinoblastoma will depend on the stage of the tumour which can either be: \n \n intraocular\u00a0\u2013 where the cancer is completely within the eye \n extraocular\u00a0\u2013 where the cancer spreads beyond the eye to the surrounding tissue, or to another part of the body (this is rarely seen in the UK)\u00a0 \n \n Most cases of retinoblastoma (9 out 10) are detected early and successfully treated before the cancer spreads outside the eyeball. \n If the cancer has spread beyond the eye it will be more difficult to treat. However, this is rare as the condition is usually identified well before it reaches this stage. \n Depending on the size and position of the tumour, your child's specialist will be able to accurately stage the cancer into one of a number of categories (A to E). \n Visit Cancer Research UK to read\u00a0more about\u00a0 retinoblastoma . \n Treating small tumours \n There are 2\u00a0possible treatment options for treating small tumours contained within the eye. These are: \n \n laser treatment to the eye (photocoagulation or thermotherapy) \n freezing the tumour (cryotherapy) \n \n These treatments are carried out under general anaesthetic, so your child will be unconscious and won't feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. In some cases, chemotherapy (see below) may be needed before or after these treatments. \n Treating larger tumours \n Larger tumours will be treated with one or a combination of the following treatments: \n \n brachytherapy\u00a0\u2013 if the tumour isn't too large, small radioactive plates called plaques are stitched over the tumour and left in place for a few days to destroy the tumour, before being removed;  radiotherapy  to the whole eye may be recommended for larger tumours that haven't responded to other treatment methods \n chemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 may be used to shrink the tumour before one of the above treatments are used, or it may be recommended if there's a\u00a0chance of the cancer spreading; in some cases, chemotherapy medication can be delivered directly to the eye \n surgery to remove the eye \u2013 is often necessary for very large tumours where there's no sight from the eye; if your child needs to have their eye removed, they'll have an artificial eye fitted in its place \n \n Side effects of treatment \n Your child's treatment team will discuss any possible side effects of treatment with you. Different treatments have different side effects. \n Sight loss\u00a0is one of the biggest worries for parents. Your child's treatment team will do everything they can to avoid your child losing their sight. If your child needs to have one of their eyes removed, the sight in their other eye won't be affected\u00a0as long as there are no tumours in the important areas for seeing in that eye. \n Children who lose sight in one eye are usually able to adapt very quickly to using their other eye, without it affecting their home and school life. If both eyes are affected by retinoblastoma, your child will probably have some degree of sight loss, and they may need support either within a mainstream or specialist school. \n The UK-based retinoblastoma charity, the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT), has more information about the\u00a0 side effects of treatment for retinoblastoma . \n Follow-up \n Retinoblastoma requires a long period of follow-up tests, which will initially be carried out at one of the specialist retinoblastoma centres. After a period of treatment and observation, the tests will usually take place at your local eye department. \n Screening for retinoblastoma \n If you're expecting a baby and you had retinoblastoma yourself as a child, or you have a family history of retinoblastoma, it's important to tell your GP or midwife. \n This is because in some cases retinoblastoma is an inherited condition and babies considered at increased risk of developing it\u00a0may be offered screening after the birth. \n Your GP will be able to refer you to a specialist centre so the appropriate tests can be arranged when your baby is born. Your children's risk will depend on the type of retinoblastoma you or your relative had. \n The aim of screening is\u00a0to identify\u00a0tumours as early as possible so that treatment can be started straight away. \n Children under 5\u00a0years of age are usually screened by having their eyes examined while under general anaesthetic. This will be carried out at 1\u00a0of the UK's 2\u00a0specialist retinoblastoma centres\u00a0(The Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital). \n Your child will need to be screened frequently up until they're 5\u00a0years old. \n Does my child need screening? \n The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) says that your child may need to be screened if: \n \n you or your partner has had\u00a0retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby or you've recently had a baby \n you or your partner has had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five years of age who hasn't been checked \n you have a child who's been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and you're expecting a baby, or you have other children under five who haven't been checked \n your parent (or brother or sister) had retinoblastoma and you have a child under five who hasn't been checked \n \n Getting support \n The specialist teams at the retinoblastoma centres at The Royal London Hospital and Birmingham Children's Hospital have a wealth of knowledge about retinoblastoma. You can discuss any worries or concerns you have with them. \n They'll also be able to put you in touch with the parents of children who've recently been diagnosed with retinoblastoma and treated for it. \n The  Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT)  can give you further information about retinoblastoma. It also provides help and support to parents and carers of children affected by retinoblastoma, as well as adults who were affected during childhood.\u00a0You can contact them on 020 7377 5578 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). \n You can also call the\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  helpline to speak to a cancer nurse who will be able to provide you with information and support. The number is 0808 800 4040 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). \n  Macmillan  operate a similar helpline\u00a0\u2013\u00a00808 808 00 00 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Restless legs syndrome", "introduction": "Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system that causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs. \n It can also cause an unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation\u00a0in the feet, calves and thighs. The sensation is often worse in the evening\u00a0or at night. Occasionally, the arms are affected too. \n Restless legs syndrome is also associated with involuntary jerking of the legs and arms, known as periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). \n Some people have\u00a0the symptoms of restless legs syndrome occasionally, while others have them every day. The symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases, restless legs syndrome can be very distressing and disrupt a person's daily activities. \n What causes restless legs syndrome? \n In the majority of cases, there's no obvious cause of\u00a0restless legs syndrome. This known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families. \n Some neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles\u00a0a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and\u00a0may\u00a0be responsible for\u00a0the involuntary leg movements associated with\u00a0restless legs syndrome. \n In some cases, restless legs syndrome is caused by an underlying health condition,\u00a0such as  iron deficiency anaemia \u00a0or kidney failure. This is known as secondary\u00a0restless legs syndrome. \n There's also a link between\u00a0restless legs syndrome and pregnancy. About 1 in\u00a05 pregnant women will experience symptoms in the last three months of their pregnancy, although it's not clear exactly why this is. In such cases,\u00a0restless legs syndrome usually disappears after the woman has given birth. \n Read more about the  causes of restless legs syndrome  \n Treating restless legs syndrome \n Mild cases of\u00a0restless legs syndrome that aren't linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes, such as: \n \n adopting\u00a0good sleep habits\u00a0\u2013 for example, following a regular bedtime ritual, sleeping regular hours, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night \n  quitting smoking \u00a0if you\u00a0smoke \n  exercising regularly \u00a0during the daytime \n \n If your symptoms\u00a0are more severe, you may need medication to regulate the levels of dopamine and iron\u00a0in your body. \n If\u00a0restless legs syndrome is caused by iron deficiency anaemia, iron supplements may be all that's needed to treat the symptoms. \n Read more about  treating restless legs syndrome  \n Who's affected by restless legs syndrome? \n As many as 1 in 10 people are affected by\u00a0restless legs syndrome at some point in their life. \n Women are twice as likely to develop\u00a0restless legs syndrome than men. It's also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood. \n Outlook \n The\u00a0symptoms\u00a0of\u00a0restless legs syndrome will usually disappear if it's possible to address an underlying cause.\u00a0 \n However, if the cause\u00a0is unknown, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with time and severely affect the person's life. Restless legs syndrome isn't life threatening, but severe cases can severely disrupt sleep (causing  insomnia )\u00a0and trigger anxiety and  depression .", "symptoms": "Restless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs and an uncomfortable sensation in your legs. \n The sensation may also affect your arms, chest and face, too. It has been described as: \n \n tingling, burning, itching or throbbing \n a \"creepy-crawly\" feeling \n feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs \n a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves\u00a0 \n \n These unpleasant sensations\u00a0can range from mild to unbearable, and are usually worse in the evening and during the night. They can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs. \n Some people experience symptoms occasionally,\u00a0while others have them every day. You may find it difficult to\u00a0sit for long periods of time\u00a0\u2013 for example, on\u00a0a long train journey. \n Just over half of people with\u00a0restless legs syndrome also experience episodes of lowerback pain. \n Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) \n Up to 80% of people with\u00a0restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). \n If you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably,\u00a0usually\u00a0at night while you're asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds. \n PLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements\u00a0can also occur when you're awake and resting.", "causes": "In many cases, the exact cause of restless legs syndrome is unknown. \n When no cause can be found, it's\u00a0known as \"idiopathic\" or primary restless legs syndrome. \n Research has identified specific genes related to restless legs syndrome, and\u00a0it can run in families. In these cases, symptoms usually occur before the age of 40. \n Dopamine \n There's evidence to suggest restless legs syndrome is related to a problem with part of the brain called the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia uses a chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and\u00a0movement. \n Dopamine acts as a messenger between the brain and nervous system to help the brain regulate and co-ordinate movement. If\u00a0nerve cells become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced, which causes muscle spasms and\u00a0involuntary movements. \n Dopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day, which may explain why the\u00a0 symptoms of restless legs syndrome  are often worse in the evening and during the night. \n Underlying health condition \n Restless legs syndrome can sometimes occur\u00a0as a complication of another health condition, or it can be the result of another health-related factor. This is known as secondary\u00a0restless legs syndrome. \n You can\u00a0develop secondary\u00a0restless legs syndrome if you: \n \n have\u00a0 iron deficiency anaemia  \u2013\u00a0low levels of iron in the blood can lead to a fall in dopamine, triggering\u00a0restless legs syndrome \n have a long-term health condition \u2013\u00a0such as  chronic kidney disease ,  diabetes ,  Parkinson's disease ,  rheumatoid arthritis , an  underactive thyroid gland , or  fibromyalgia \u00a0\u00a0 \n are pregnant \u2013\u00a0particularly from week 27\u00a0until birth; in most cases the symptoms disappear within four weeks of giving birth \n \n Triggers \n There are a number of triggers that don't cause\u00a0restless legs syndrome, but can make symptoms worse. These include medications such as: \n \n some  antidepressants  \n antipsychotics \n lithium\u00a0\u2013 used in the treatment of  bipolar disorder  \n calcium channel blockers\u00a0\u2013 used in the treatment of  high blood pressure  \n some antihistamines \n metoclopramide\u00a0\u2013 used to relieve nausea \n \n Other possible triggers include: \n \n excessive  smoking , caffeine or\u00a0 alcohol  \n being overweight or  obese  \n stress \n lack of\u00a0 exercise", "treatment": "Mild restless legs syndrome that isn't linked to an underlying health condition can be managed with just a few lifestyle changes. \n If symptoms are more severe, medication may be needed. \n Restless legs syndrome caused by an underlying health condition\u00a0can often be cured by\u00a0treating that condition. For example,\u00a0 iron deficiency anaemia  can be treated by taking iron supplements. \n If it's associated with pregnancy, it\u00a0usually disappears on its own within four weeks of the birth. \n Lifestyle changes \n A\u00a0number of lifestyle changes may be enough to ease the  symptoms of restless legs syndrome, \u00a0including: \n \n avoiding stimulants in the evening \u2013 such as caffeine, tobacco and  alcohol  \n not smoking \u2013 read more about  quitting smoking  \n taking regular daily  exercise \u00a0\u2013 but avoid exercising near bedtime   \n practising  good sleep habits \u00a0\u2013 for example, going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, not napping during the day, taking time to relax before going to bed, and avoiding caffeine close to bedtime \n avoiding medicines that trigger the symptoms or make them worse \u2013 if you think medication is causing your symptoms, continue to take it and make an appointment to see your GP \n \n During an episode of\u00a0restless legs syndrome, the following measures may help relieve your\u00a0symptoms: \n \n massaging your legs \n taking a hot bath in the evening \n applying a hot or cold compress to your leg muscles \n doing activities that distract your mind, such as reading or watching television \n relaxation exercises, such as\u00a0 yoga or\u00a0tai chi  \n  walking \u00a0and\u00a0 stretching  \n \n A\u00a0small medical trial carried out in 2011 found a type of osteopathic exercise technique called positional release manipulation could be of benefit to people with\u00a0restless legs syndrome. It involves holding different parts of the body in positions found to reduce feelings of pain and discomfort. \n Medication \n Dopamine agonists \n Dopamine agonists may be recommended if you're experiencing frequent symptoms of restless legs syndrome. They work by increasing dopamine levels, which are often low. \n Dopamine agonists that may be recommended\u00a0include: \n \n ropinirole\u00a0 \n pramipexole\u00a0 \n rotigotine\u00a0skin patch \n \n These medications can occasionally make you feel sleepy, so you should be cautious when\u00a0driving or using tools or machinery after taking them. Other possible side effects\u00a0can include nausea, dizziness and  headaches . \n If you experience nausea while taking a dopamine agonist, you may be given medication to help with this (antiemitic medication). \n Impulse control disorder (ICD) is a less common side effect sometimes associated with dopamine agonists. \n People with ICD are unable to resist the urge to do something harmful to themselves or others. For example, this could be an\u00a0addiciton to  alcohol , drugs, gambling, shopping, or sex\u00a0(hypersexuality). \n However, the urges associated with ICD will subside once treatment with the dopamine agonist is stopped. \n Painkillers \n A mild opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol, may be prescribed to relieve pain associated with\u00a0restless legs syndrome. \n Gabapentin and pregabalin are also sometimes prescribed to help relieve painful symptoms of restless legs syndrome. Side effects of these medications\u00a0include dizziness, tiredness and headaches. \n Aiding sleep \n If\u00a0restless legs syndrome\u00a0is disrupting your sleep, a short-term course of medication may be recommended to help you sleep. \n These types of medication are known as hypnotics, and include temazepam and loprazolam. Hypnotics are usually only recommended for short-term use (typically no longer than a week). \n You may find you still feel sleepy or \"hungover\" the morning after taking your medication.\u00a0 \n Levodopa \n Levodopa may be recommended if you only have occasional symptoms of restless legs syndrome. This is because if you took levodopa every day, there's a high risk it would actually make your symptoms worse. \n Levodopa is available in tablet or liquid form, and you should take it once you feel the symptoms of\u00a0restless legs syndrome coming on. \n The medication will make you feel very sleepy (often suddenly), so you should never drive or use tools or machinery after taking levodopa.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "There's no single test for diagnosing restless legs syndrome. \n A diagnosis will be based on your symptoms, your medical and family history, a physical examination, and your test results. \n Your GP should be able to diagnose restless legs syndrome, but they may refer you to a neurologist if there's any uncertainty. \n There are four main criteria your GP or specialist will look for to confirm a diagnosis. These are: \n \n an overwhelming urge to move your legs, usually with an uncomfortable sensation such as\u00a0itching or tingling \n your symptoms occur or get worse when you're resting or inactive \n your symptoms are relieved by moving your legs or rubbing them \n your symptoms are worse during the evening or at night \n \n Assessing your symptoms \n Your GP or specialist will ask you about the pattern of your symptoms to help assess their severity. For example, they may ask you: \n \n how often you have symptoms \n how unpleasant you find your symptoms \n whether your symptoms cause significant distress \n whether your sleep is disrupted, making you tired during the day \n \n Keeping a\u00a0sleep diary may help your doctor assess your symptoms. You can use the diary to record your daily sleeping habits, such as the time you go to bed, how long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake during the\u00a0night, and episodes of tiredness during the day. \n Mild\u00a0 symptoms of restless legs syndrome  can usually be treated by making lifestyle changes\u00a0\u2013 for example, establishing a regular sleeping pattern and avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine, alcohol or tobacco, in the evening. \n If your symptoms are more severe, you may need medication to bring them under control. \n Read more about  treating restless leg syndrome  \n Blood tests \n Your GP may refer you for\u00a0 blood tests  to confirm or rule out possible underlying causes of restless legs syndrome.\u00a0For example, you may have blood tests to rule out conditions such as  anaemia ,\u00a0 diabetes  and kidney function problems. \n It's particularly important to find out the levels of iron in your blood because low iron levels can sometimes cause secondary restless legs syndrome. Low iron levels can be treated with\u00a0iron tablets. \n Sleep tests \n If you have\u00a0restless legs syndrome and your sleep is being severely disrupted, sleep tests\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as a\u00a0suggested immobilisation test \u2013\u00a0may be recommended. The test involves\u00a0lying\u00a0on a bed for a set period of time without moving your legs while any\u00a0involuntary leg movements are monitored. \n Occasionally, polysomnography may be recommended. This is a test that measures your breathing rate, brain waves and heartbeat throughout the course of a night. The results will confirm whether you have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Reactive arthritis", "introduction": "Reactive arthritis, formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in various places in the body. \n It usually develops following an infection, and in most cases clears up in a few months without\u00a0causing long-term problems. \n The three most common places\u00a0affected by reactive arthritis\u00a0are: \n \n the joints ( arthritis ), which can cause\u00a0pain, stiffness and swelling \n the eyes ( conjunctivitis ), which can cause\u00a0eye pain and redness \n the urethra\u00a0(non-gonococcal urethritis), which can cause pain when urinating (the urethra\u00a0is the tube that carries urine out of the body)\u00a0 \n \n However,\u00a0most people will not experience all of these problems.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  symptoms of reactive arthritis . \n What causes reactive arthritis? \n Reactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a  sexually transmitted infection (STI)  such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel. \n For reasons that are still unclear, the immune system (the body's defence against infection) appears to malfunction in response to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed. \n Read more about the  causes of reactive arthritis . \n Seeking medical advice \n See\u00a0your GP if\u00a0you have\u00a0swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had\u00a0symptoms of an infection such as  diarrhoea  or pain when passing urine. \n There is no single test for reactive arthritis, although blood and urine tests, genital swabs\u00a0and  X-rays  may be used to check for\u00a0infection and rule out other causes of your symptoms. \n Your GP will also want to know about your recent medical history,\u00a0such as whether you may have recently had a\u00a0bowel infection or an STI. \n How reactive arthritis is treated \n There is currently no cure for reactive arthritis, but most people get better in around six months. Meanwhile, treatment can help to relieve symptoms such as pain and stiffness. \n Symptoms can\u00a0often be controlled using\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and painkillers such as  ibuprofen . \n Severe symptoms\u00a0may\u00a0require more powerful steroid medication ( corticosteroids ) or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). \n Read more about  treating reactive arthritis . \n Who is affected \n Reactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40. \n Men are generally affected more than woman\u00a0\u2013 particularly in cases linked to STIs, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men. \n People who have a certain gene called HLA-B27, which is found in around one in every 10 people in the\u00a0UK,\u00a0are about thought to be around 50 times more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don't have this gene. \n Preventing reactive arthritis \n The most effective way to reduce your risk of reactive arthritis is to avoid the STIs and\u00a0bowel infections that most commonly\u00a0cause the condition. \n The most effective way of preventing STIs is to always use a barrier method of  contraception , such as a  condom , during sex with a new partner.\u00a0 \n Read advice\u00a0on  STIs ,  contraception  and  sexual health . \n Ensuring good standards of hygiene when preparing and storing food can help to prevent gastrointestinal infections.\u00a0Read about\u00a0 preventing food poisoning .", "symptoms": "The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually develop within four weeks of an infection. \n In most cases, reactive arthritis follows a  sexually transmitted infection (STI)  such as chlamydia, or a\u00a0bowel infection such as  food poisoning . \n The three parts of the body most commonly affected by reactive arthritis\u00a0are the: \n \n joints and\u00a0tendons \n urinary system \n eyes \n \n However, most people won't experience problems in\u00a0all of these areas. \n Joints and tendons \n Reactive arthritis usually involves inflammation of the joints ( arthritis ) and tendons, which can cause: \n \n joint pain, tenderness and swelling \u2013 usually in weight-bearing joints such as your knees, feet and ankles \n lower back and buttock pain \n swelling of your fingers and toes \n joint stiffness \u2013 particularly in the morning \n \n See your GP if you have any swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had\u00a0 diarrhoea  or problems passing urine. \n The urinary system \n Reactive arthritis can sometimes also\u00a0involve inflammation of the urethra (non-gonococcal urethritis), which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. Symptoms of urethritis can\u00a0include: \n \n pain or a burning sensation when you pee \n urinating more often than usual \n having a sudden urge to\u00a0pee \n a discharge of fluid from the penis or vagina \n blood in your urine (less commonly) \n \n The eyes \n Reactive arthritis may occasionally\u00a0involve inflammation of the eyes ( conjunctivitis ). Symptoms of conjunctivitis can\u00a0include: \n \n red eyes \n watery eyes \n eye pain \n swollen eye lids \n \n In rare cases, a type of\u00a0uveitis called iritis can develop.\u00a0Iritis can cause the eyes to become\u00a0painful, red and sensitive to light.\u00a0See your doctor or an eye specialist as soon as possible if you have these symptoms. \n Other symptoms \n Reactive arthritis can also cause symptoms, including: \n \n feeling unusually tired \n a\u00a0high\u00a0temperature\u00a0(fever) \n weight loss \n  mouth ulcers  \n painless white\u00a0patches\u00a0inside your mouth \n a rash \n thick and crumbly nails \n  abdominal (tummy) pain  \n bouts of\u00a0diarrhoea", "causes": "It's not known exactly what causes reactive arthritis, but it's thought to be the result of the immune system reacting to an infection. \n The immune system \n Your immune system is your body's defence against illness and infection. When it senses a virus or bacteria, it\u00a0sends antibodies and cells to fight the infection. This causes tissues to swell, known as inflammation, which makes\u00a0it harder for the\u00a0infection to spread.\u00a0\u00a0 \n In cases of reactive arthritis, something goes wrong with the immune system and it causes inflammation in parts of the body that were not infected, often after the infection has already passed. \n Infection \n The two most common types of infection linked to reactive arthritis are: \n \n  sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u00a0\u2013 such as chlamydia\u00a0or gonorrhoea, although many cases\u00a0occur after\u00a0non-gonococcal urethritis \n infections of the\u00a0bowel and digestive system (gastrointestinal infections) \u2013 usually\u00a0caused by either campylobacter or salmonella bacteria, both of which can cause  food poisoning  \n \n Genetic factors \n Research has shown that people with a specific gene known as HLA-B27 have a significantly\u00a0increased chance of developing reactive arthritis, as well as related conditions such as  ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis that affects the spine) . \n In the UK, it's estimated that\u00a0around\u00a01 in every 10 people have the HLA-B27 gene. Around\u00a03\u00a0out of every\u00a04 cases of reactive arthritis develop in people with the gene. \n People with\u00a0the HLA-B27 gene also tend to have more severe and longer-lasting symptoms, with a greater risk of their symptoms recurring. \n Exactly how the gene contributes to the development of reactive arthritis is unclear.", "treatment": "There's no cure for reactive arthritis, but the condition is usually temporary and treatment can help to relieve your symptoms. \n Most people will make a full recovery in about six months, although around one in five cases lasts a year or more, and a small number of people experience long-term joint problems. \n There is also a risk you could develop the condition again after another infection. \n Self-care \n In the initial stages of reactive arthritis, it's recommended\u00a0that you get plenty of rest and avoid using affected joints. \n As your symptoms improve, you should begin a gradual programme of exercise\u00a0designed to strengthen affected muscles and improve the range of movement in your affected joints. \n Your GP or specialist may recommend a suitable\u00a0 exercise programme for your arthritis . Alternatively, you may be referred to a physiotherapist for physical therapy. \n You might also find ice packs and heat pads useful in reducing joint pain and swelling, although these should not be directly placed on your\u00a0skin. \n Antibiotics \n  Antibiotics \u00a0may not help to treat reactive arthritis itself, but they are sometimes prescribed if you have an ongoing infection\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you have a\u00a0sexually transmitted infection (STI). Your recent sexual partner(s) may also need treatment. \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen ,\u00a0are the main medication used for reactive arthritis, as they can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. \n However, taking a regular dose of a NSAID on a long-term basis can increase your risk of problems such as  stomach ulcers . If you are at an increased risk of developing stomach ulcers, your GP may recommend an additional medication known as a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which can protect your stomach by reducing the production of stomach acid. \n Rarely, long-term use of NSAIDs\u00a0can also slightly increase your risk of having a\u00a0 heart attack  or  stroke . Read more about the  side effects of NSAIDs . \n Steroid medication \n Steroid medication ( corticosteroids ) may be recommended if your symptoms don't respond to NSAIDs, or you're unable to use NSAIDs. \n Steroids work by blocking the effects of many of the chemicals the body uses to trigger inflammation. \n A corticosteroid called prednisolone is usually the preferred choice. Prednisolone can be given as an injection into a joint or as a tablet. Eye drops are also available if you have inflamed eyes ( conjunctivitis ). \n Around\u00a01 in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state, such as  depression  or hallucinations. Contact your GP as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behaviour. \n Other side effects can include weight gain,  acne , stomach ulcers and  osteoporosis ,\u00a0although these should improve as your dose is decreased. Read more about the  side effects of corticosteroids . \n Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \n If your symptoms persist despite treatment with NSAIDs and/or corticosteroids, you may be prescribed a medication known as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). \n Like corticosteroids, DMARDs work by\u00a0blocking the effects of some of the chemicals your immune system uses to trigger inflammation. \n It can take a few months before you notice a DMARD working, so it's important to keep taking medication even if you don't see immediate results. \n A DMARD called sulfasalazine is usually the preferred option. Common side effects of sulfasalazine include feeling sick, loss of appetite and  headaches , although these usually improve once your body gets used to the medication.\u00a0 \n DMARDs may also\u00a0cause changes in\u00a0your blood or liver, so it's important to have regular  blood\u00a0tests  while taking these medicines.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Psychosis", "introduction": "Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. This might involve hallucinations or delusions. \n The two main\u00a0 symptoms of psychosis  are: \n \n hallucinations\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren't there; a common hallucination is hearing voices \n delusions \u2013\u00a0where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example,\u00a0thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you \n \n The combination of hallucinations and delusional thinking can often severely disrupt perception, thinking, emotion, and behaviour. \n Experiencing the symptoms of psychosis is often referred to as having a psychotic episode. \n What causes psychosis? \n Psychosis isn't a condition in itself\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it's triggered by\u00a0other conditions. \n It's\u00a0sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as: \n \n  schizophrenia \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including hallucinations and delusions \n  bipolar disorder \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a mental health condition that affects mood; a person with bipolar disorder can have episodes of\u00a0 depression \u00a0(lows) and mania (highs) \n severe depression \u2013\u00a0some people with depression also have symptoms of psychosis when they're very depressed \n \n Psychosis can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, stress, or physical conditions, such as\u00a0 Parkinson's disease , a  brain tumour , or as\u00a0a result of\u00a0drug\u00a0misuse or  alcohol misuse . \n How often a psychotic episode occurs and how long it lasts can depend on the underlying cause. \n For example, schizophrenia can be long term, but most people can make a good recovery and about a quarter only have a single psychotic episode. Episodes related to bipolar disorder usually resolve, but may recur. \n Read more about the  causes of psychosis . \n Diagnosing psychosis \n You should see your GP immediately if you're experiencing psychotic episodes. It's important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes. \n Your GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. They may ask you some questions to help determine what's causing your psychosis. For example, they may ask you: \n \n whether you're taking any medication \n whether you've been taking illegal substances \n how your mood has been\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you've been depressed \n how you've been functioning day-to-day\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you're still working \n whether you have a family history of mental health conditions\u00a0\u2013 such as schizophrenia \n about your hallucinations\u00a0\u2013 such as whether you've heard voices \n about your delusions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as whether you feel people are controlling you \n whether you have any other symptoms \n \n Your GP should refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment. \n Read more about  diagnosing psychosis . \n Treating psychosis \n Treatment for psychosis involves using a combination of: \n \n antipsychotic medication \u2013\u00a0which can help relieve the symptoms of psychosis \n psychological therapies \u2013\u00a0the one-to-one talking therapy cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0has proved successful in helping people with schizophrenia;\u00a0in appropriate cases, family therapy has been shown to reduce the need for hospital treatment in people with psychosis \n social support \u2013\u00a0support with social needs, such as education, employment, or accommodation \n \n Most people with psychosis who get better with medication need to continue taking it for at least a year. Some people need to take medication long term to prevent symptoms recurring. \n If a person's psychotic episodes are severe, they may need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. \n Read more about the  treatment of psychosis . \n Getting help for others \n People with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They're unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely. \n Because of\u00a0their lack of insight,\u00a0it's often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them. \n If you're concerned about someone you know and think they may have psychosis, you could contact their social worker or community mental health nurse if they've previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. If you think the person's symptoms are placing them at possible risk of harm, you can: \n \n take them to the nearest\u00a0accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department, if they agree \n call their GP or\u00a0local out-of-hours GP \n call 999 and ask for an ambulance \n \n Complications \n People with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both. \n This may be because these\u00a0substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term. \n People with psychosis also have a higher than average risk of\u00a0 suicide . It's estimated\u00a01 in 5 people with psychosis will attempt to commit suicide at some point in their life, and\u00a01 in 25 people with psychosis will kill themselves. \n Side effects can also occur if someone is\u00a0taking antipsychotics on a long-term basis.

They can occur in all five of the senses:\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n sight \u2013\u00a0someone with psychosis may see colours and shapes, or people or animals that aren't there \n sounds \u2013\u00a0someone with psychosis may hear voices that are angry, unpleasant or sarcastic \n touch \u2013\u00a0a common psychotic hallucination is that you are being touched when there is nobody there \n smell \u2013\u00a0usually a strange or unpleasant odour \n taste \u2013 some people with psychosis have complained of having a constant unpleasant taste in their mouth \n \n Delusions \n A delusion is where a person has an unshakeable belief in something implausible, bizarre, or obviously untrue. Paranoid delusion and delusions of grandeur are two examples of psychotic delusions. \n A person with psychosis will often believe an individual or organisation is making plans to hurt or kill them. This can lead to unusual behaviour. For example, a person with psychosis may refuse to be in the same room as a mobile phone because they believe they are mind control devices. \n Someone with psychosis may also have delusions of grandeur. This is where they believe they have some imaginary power or authority. For example, they may think they're the president of a country or they have the power to bring people back from the dead. \n Confused and disturbed thoughts \n People with psychosis often have disturbed, confused, and disrupted patterns of thought. Signs of this include: \n \n rapid and constant speech \n random speech\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, they may switch from one topic to another mid-sentence \n a sudden loss\u00a0in their train of thought, resulting in an abrupt pause in conversation or activity \n \n Lack of insight \n People who have psychotic episodes are often totally unaware their behaviour is in any way strange or that their delusions or hallucinations are not real. \n They may recognise delusional or bizarre behaviour in others, but lack the self-awareness to recognise it in themselves. \n For example, a person with psychosis being treated in a psychiatric ward may complain that their fellow patients are mentally unwell, while they're perfectly normal. \n Postnatal psychosis \n Postnatal psychosis, also called puerperal psychosis, is a severe form of\u00a0 postnatal depression , a type of depression some women experience after having a baby. \n It's estimated postnatal psychosis affects around 1 in every 1,000 women who give birth. It most commonly occurs during the first\u00a0few weeks\u00a0after having a baby. \n Postnatal psychosis is more likely\u00a0to affect women who already have a mental health condition, such as  bipolar disorder  or  schizophrenia .\u00a0 \n As well as the symptoms of psychosis, symptoms of postnatal psychosis can also include: \n \n a high mood (mania)\u00a0\u2013 for example, talking and thinking\u00a0too much or too quickly \n a low mood\u00a0\u2013 for example,  depression , lack of energy,\u00a0loss of\u00a0appetite, and trouble sleeping \n \n Postnatal psychosis is regarded as a medical emergency. Contact your GP immediately if you think someone you know may have developed postnatal psychosis. If this isn't possible, call the\u00a0NHS 24 '111' service\u00a0or your local\u00a0out-of-hours service. \n If you think there's an imminent danger of\u00a0harm, call 999 and ask for an ambulance.", "causes": "The causes of psychosis have three main classifications. \n They are psychosis caused by: \n \n mental (psychological)\u00a0conditions \n general medical conditions \n substances, such as alcohol or drugs \n \n The three classifications are described in more detail below. \n Psychological causes \n The following conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people: \n \n  schizophrenia \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long-term (chronic) mental health condition that causes hallucinations and delusions \n  bipolar disorder \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that affects a person's moods, which can swing from one extreme to another (highs and lows) \n severe  stress \u00a0or  anxiety  \n severe  depression \u00a0\u2013\u00a0feelings of persistent sadness that last for more\u00a0than six weeks, including\u00a0 postnatal depression ,\u00a0which some women experience after having a baby \n lack of sleep \n \n The underlying psychological cause will often influence the type of psychotic episode someone experiences. \n For example, a person with bipolar disorder is more likely to have delusions of grandeur, whereas someone with depression or schizophrenia is more likely to develop  paranoid delusions . \n General medical conditions \n The following medical conditions have been known to trigger psychotic episodes in some people: \n \n  HIV and AIDS \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a virus that attacks the body's natural defence against illness and infection (the immune system) \n  malaria \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a tropical disease spread by infected mosquitoes \n syphilis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a bacterial infection usually passed on through sexual contact \n  Alzheimer's disease \u00a0\u2013\u00a0the most common form of\u00a0dementia, which causes a decline in mental abilities like memory and reasoning \n  Parkinson's disease \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long-term condition that affects the way the brain co-ordinates body movements, including walking, talking, and writing \n  hypoglycaemia \u00a0\u2013\u00a0an abnormally low level of sugar (glucose) in the blood \n  lupus \u00a0\u2013 a condition where the immune system attacks healthy tissue \n Lyme disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks \n  multiple sclerosis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that affects the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, causing problems with muscle movement, balance, and vision\u00a0 \n  brain tumour \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a growth of cells in the brain that multiply in an abnormal and uncontrollable way \n \n Substances \n  Alcohol misuse \u00a0and\u00a0drug misuse can trigger a psychotic episode. \n A person can also experience a psychotic episode if they suddenly stop drinking\u00a0alcohol or\u00a0taking drugs after using them for a long time. This is known as withdrawal. \n It's also possible to experience psychosis after drinking large amounts of alcohol or if you're high on drugs. \n Drugs known to trigger psychotic episodes include: \n \n cocaine \n amphetamine (speed) \n methamphetamine (crystal meth) \n mephedrone (MCAT or miaow) \n MDMA (ecstasy) \n cannabis \n LSD (acid) \n psilocybins (magic mushrooms) \n ketamine \n \n In rare situations, psychosis can also occur as a side effect of some types of medication or as a result of an overdose of that medication. \n For example, levodopa, a medication used to treat  Parkinson's disease , can sometimes cause psychotic episodes. However, any medicine that acts on the brain can cause psychosis with an overdose. \n Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional\u00a0responsible for your care. \n See your GP if you're experiencing psychotic side effects\u00a0caused by\u00a0medication. \n The brain \n There's been a great deal of research into how psychosis affects the brain and how changes in the brain can trigger  symptoms of psychosis . \n Grey matter \n Research has revealed several physical and biological changes occur in the brain\u00a0during a psychotic episode. Grey matter is the part of the brain responsible for processing thoughts. \n The results of\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  have shown some people with a history of psychosis have less grey matter than most other people. However, it's not yet fully understood why this is. \n Dopamine \n Researchers also believe dopamine plays an important role in psychosis. \n Dopamine is a neurotransmitter,\u00a0one of many chemicals the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another.\u00a0It is associated with how we feel whether something is significant, important, or interesting. \n It's thought\u00a0levels of dopamine in the brain become too high\u00a0in people with psychosis. The excess dopamine interrupts specific pathways in the brain that are responsible for some of its most important functions, such as: \n \n memory \n emotion \n social behaviour \n self-awareness \n \n Disruption to these important brain functions may explain the symptoms of psychosis. \n Evidence for the role of dopamine in psychosis comes from several sources, including brain scans and\u00a0the fact medications\u00a0known to reduce the effects of dopamine in the brain also reduce the\u00a0symptoms of psychosis. \n However, illegal drugs\u00a0known to increase\u00a0levels of dopamine in the brain\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines\u00a0\u2013\u00a0can trigger psychosis.", "treatment": "Treatment for psychosis involves a combination of antipsychotic medicines, psychological therapies, and social support. \n Your care team \n Your treatment is likely to be co-ordinated by a team of mental health professionals working together. If this is your first psychotic episode, you may be referred to an early intervention team. \n Early intervention teams \n An early intervention team is a\u00a0team of healthcare professionals set up specifically to work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis. \n Some early intervention teams only focus on a certain age range, such as people who are 14 to 35 years old. \n Depending on your care needs, early intervention teams aim to provide: \n \n a full assessment of your symptoms \n prescriptions for medications \n psychological services \n social, occupational, and educational interventions \n \n Treatment for psychosis will vary, depending on the underlying cause. You'll receive specific treatment if you've been diagnosed with an underlying mental health condition as well. \n For example,  treatment for bipolar disorder \u00a0uses a variety of medications, which could include antipsychotics to treat symptoms of mania, lithium and anticonvulsants to help stabilise mood, as well as psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \n Treatment for schizophrenia usually involves a combination of antipsychotic medication and social support. CBT or another type of  psychotherapy \u00a0called family therapy\u00a0are also often used.\u00a0 \n Psychosis related to drug or alcohol intoxication or withdrawal may only require a short course of antipsychotics or tranquillisers, which have a calming effect. Referral to an addiction counsellor may then be recommended. \n Antipsychotics \n Antipsychotic medicines, also known as neuroleptics, are usually recommended as the first treatment for psychosis. They\u00a0work by blocking the effect of dopamine, a chemical that transmits messages in the brain. \n However, they're not suitable or effective for everyone, as side effects can affect people differently. In particular, antipsychotics will be monitored closely in people who also have  epilepsy , a condition that causes seizures or fits. \n People who have  cardiovascular disease \u00a0\u2013 conditions that affect the heart, blood vessels, or circulation, such as  heart disease \u00a0\u2013 will also be closely monitored. \n Antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but they may take several days or weeks to reduce other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts. \n Antipsychotics can be taken by mouth (orally) or given as an injection. There are several slow-release antipsychotics, where you only need one injection every two to six weeks. \n Depending on the underlying cause of your psychosis, you may only need to take antipsychotics until your psychosis subsides. \n However, if you have a condition like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, you may need to take antipsychotics on a long-term basis to prevent further episodes of psychosis. \n Side effects \n Antipsychotics can have side effects, although not everyone will experience them and their severity will differ from person to person. \n Side effects\u00a0can include: \n \n drowsiness\u00a0\u2013 this may affect your ability to drive\u00a0 \n shaking and trembling \n restlessness \n muscle twitches and spasms\u00a0\u2013 where your muscles shorten tightly and painfully \n blurred vision \n dizziness\u00a0 \n  constipation  \n loss of sex drive (libido) \n  dry mouth \u00a0 \n \n See the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for a full list of possible side effects. In addition,\u00a0long-term use of antipsychotics can lead to complications\u00a0like\u00a0weight gain and  diabetes . \n Read more about\u00a0the\u00a0 complications\u00a0of psychosis . \n Tell your GP if you have\u00a0side effects that are becoming particularly troublesome. There may be an alternative antipsychotic medicine you can take. \n Never stop taking medication prescribed for you unless\u00a0advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional\u00a0responsible for your care. \n Suddenly stopping prescription medication could trigger a return\u00a0of your symptoms (relapse). When it's time for you to stop taking your medication, it will be done gradually and under close observation.\u00a0 \n Psychological treatment \n Psychological treatment can help reduce the intensity and anxiety caused by psychosis. Some possible psychological treatments are discussed below. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis is based on an understanding of how people make sense of their experiences and why some people become distressed by them. \n The aim of CBT is to identify unhelpful thinking patterns and emotions that may be causing your unwanted feelings and behaviours. It's then possible to learn to replace this thinking with more realistic and balanced thoughts. \n A CBT therapist may encourage you to consider different ways of understanding what's happening to you. The aim is to help you achieve goals that are meaningful and important to you, such as reducing your distress, returning to work or university, or regaining a sense of control. \n Family therapy \n Family therapy is known to be an effective form of treatment for people with psychosis. It's a way of helping both you and your family cope with your condition. \n After having an episode of psychosis, you may rely on your family members for\u00a0care and support. While most family members are happy to help, the stress of caring for somebody can place a strain on any family. \n Family therapy involves a series of informal meetings that take place over a period of six months. Meetings may include: \n \n discussing your condition\u00a0and how it might progress, plus the available treatments\u00a0\u00a0 \n exploring ways of supporting someone with psychosis\u00a0 \n deciding how to solve practical problems caused by psychosis, such as\u00a0planning how to manage future psychotic episodes\u00a0 \n \n Self-help groups \n If you're experiencing episodes of psychosis, you may benefit from being around other people who've had similar experiences.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "You should visit your GP if you're experiencing psychotic episodes. \n It's important to speak to your GP as soon as possible as the early treatment of psychosis usually has better long-term outcomes.\u00a0 \n Initial assessment \n There's no test to positively diagnose psychosis. However, your GP will look at your symptoms and rule out short-term causes, such as drug misuse. \n Your GP may ask questions to determine the cause of your psychosis. For example, they may ask\u00a0you: \n \n whether you're taking any medication \n whether you've been taking\u00a0illegal substances \n how your moods have been\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you've been depressed\u00a0 \n how you've been functioning day-to-day\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, whether you're still working \n whether you have a family history of mental health conditions, such as\u00a0 schizophrenia  \n about the details of your hallucinations, such as whether you've heard voices \n about the details of your delusions, such as whether you feel people are controlling you \n about any other symptoms you have \n \n Referral \n The evidence supporting the early treatment of psychosis means you're likely to be referred to a specialist urgently. This will either be during or after your first episode of psychosis. \n Who you're referred to will depend on the services available in your area. You may be referred to: \n \n a community mental health team \u2013\u00a0a team of different mental health professionals who provide support to people with complex mental health conditions \n a crisis resolution team \u2013\u00a0a team of different mental health professionals who treat people currently experiencing a psychotic episode who would otherwise require hospitalisation \n an early intervention team \u2013\u00a0a team of mental health professionals who work with people who have experienced their first episode of psychosis \n \n These teams are likely to include some or all of the following healthcare professionals: \n \n a psychologist \u2013\u00a0a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions \n a psychiatrist \u2013\u00a0a qualified medical doctor who has received further training in treating mental health conditions \n a community mental health nurse \u2013\u00a0a nurse with specialist training in mental health conditions \n \n Your psychiatrist will carry out a full assessment to help identify and diagnose any underlying mental health condition that could be causing your symptoms. This will help\u00a0when planning your  treatment for psychosis . \n Helping others \n The lack of insight associated with psychosis means people experiencing\u00a0it aren't always able to recognise their strange behaviour. \n They may be reluctant to visit their GP if they believe there's nothing wrong with them, and you may need to get help for them. \n Someone who has had psychotic episodes in the past may have been assigned a mental health worker, who works in social services,\u00a0so try to contact them to express your concerns. \n Someone who is having a psychotic episode for the first time may need a friend, relative or someone else close to them to persuade them to visit their GP. \n If they're having a psychotic episode that's rapidly getting worse, you should contact their crisis team or,\u00a0if the team isn't available,\u00a0the duty psychiatrist at their nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department. \n If a person who is having a psychotic episode refuses to seek help and\u00a0is believed to present a risk to themselves or others, their nearest relative can request a psychological assessment. Your\u00a0 local mental health trust  can advise you about this. \n If someone has very severe psychosis, they can be compulsorily detained at hospital for assessment and treatment\u00a0under the\u00a0 Mental Health (Scotland) Act 2015 ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Raynaud's phenomenon", "introduction": "Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body \u2013 usually the fingers and toes. \n It's often referred to as Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0disease or just Raynaud's. \n Why does it happen? \n Raynaud\u2019s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood. \n This causes the affected area to change colour to white, then blue and then red, as the bloodflow returns.\u00a0You may also experience numbness, pain, and pins and needles. \n Symptoms of Raynaud's can last\u00a0from a few minutes to several hours. \n It's not\u00a0a serious threat to your health, but can be annoying to live with,\u00a0because it can be difficult to use your fingers.\u00a0People with Raynaud\u2019s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether. \n Other parts of the body that can be affected by Raynaud\u2019s include the ears, nose, nipples and lips. \n Treating Raynaud's \n In many cases, it may be possible to control the symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s yourself by avoiding the cold, wearing gloves and using relaxation techniques when feeling stressed. \n  Stopping smoking  can also improve symptoms, as smoking can affect your circulation. \n If you're unable to control your symptoms yourself, then a medication called nifedipine may be recommended. \n Read more about  treating Raynaud\u2019s . \n Types of Raynaud's \n There are two types of Raynaud's: \n \n primary \u2013 when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type) \n secondary \u2013 when it's caused by\u00a0another health condition \n \n Most cases of secondary Raynaud\u2019s are associated with conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue (autoimmune conditions), such as  rheumatoid arthritis \u00a0and  lupus . \n The causes of primary Raynaud\u2019s\u00a0are unclear. However\u00a01 in 10 people with primary Raynaud\u2019s goes on to develop a condition associated with secondary Raynaud\u2019s, such as lupus. \n Your GP can help to determine whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud's\u00a0by examining your symptoms and carrying out  blood tests . \n Read more about  what causes Raynaud\u2019s \u00a0and  diagnosing Raynaud's . \n Possible complications \n Secondary Raynaud\u2019s can severely restrict the\u00a0blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even\u00a0tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare. \n Read more about the  complications of Raynaud\u2019s . \n Who gets Raynaud\u2019s? \n Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon is a common condition. It affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. There may be as many as 10 million people with the condition in the UK. \n Primary Raynaud\u2019s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. Secondary Raynaud\u2019s can develop at any age, depending on the cause. \n Raynaud's is slightly more common in women than men.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Raynaud's phenomenon is the result of over-sensitive blood vessels in the body's extremities. In many cases, no cause is identified, although it's sometimes linked to other health conditions. \n When your body is exposed to cold temperatures, the extremities, such as your fingers and toes, lose heat. This is because the small blood vessels under the skin spasm, slowing down the blood supply that is helping to preserve your body's core temperature. \n In people with Raynaud's, the sensitive blood vessels overreact to cold temperatures and become narrower than usual, significantly restricting the blood flow. \n Symptoms can be triggered by mildly cool weather, getting something out of the freezer, or running your hands under a cold tap. Strong emotions such as\u00a0 stress or anxiety  may also trigger symptoms. \n Primary Raynaud\u2019s \n The most common form of Raynaud's is primary Raynaud's phenomenon. This means the condition occurs by itself, without being associated with another health condition. \n It seems that\u00a0primary Raynaud\u2019s is caused by disruptions in how the nervous system controls blood vessels. Exactly what causes these disruptions is unclear. \n There's some evidence that primary Raynaud\u2019s may be an inherited condition, as cases have been known to run in families. \n Secondary Raynaud's \n In some cases, an underlying\u00a0health condition could\u00a0be causing the blood vessels to overreact. This is called secondary Raynaud's. \n Autoimmune conditions \n The majority of cases of secondary Raynaud\u2019s are associated with autoimmune conditions, which cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue. \n Autoimmune conditions known to be associated with secondary Raynaud\u2019s include: \n \n scleroderma \u2013 a condition that causes hardening and thickening of the skin \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \u2013 which causes joint pain and swelling \n  Sjogren's syndrome  \u2013 where the immune system attacks the body\u2019s sweat and tear glands \n  lupus  \u2013 which causes tiredness, joint pain and skin rashes \n \n Around\u00a01 in 10 people with primary Raynaud\u2019s go on to develop an autoimmune condition. \n Infections \n Blood-born viral infections,  hepatitis B  and  hepatitis C , can occasionally trigger Raynaud\u2019s in some people. \n Cancer \n Some types of cancer can cause secondary Raynaud\u2019s. These are\u00a0usually cancers that develop inside the blood, bone marrow or immune system, such as: \n \n  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \u2013 a cancer of the white blood cells that mainly affects children \n lymphoma \u2013 a cancer that develops inside one or more of the glands that are part of the immune system \n  multiple myeloma  \u2013 a cancer that develops inside bone marrow \n \n Medicines \n Secondary Raynaud's can also be a side effect of taking certain medicines, including: \n \n some types of anti- migraine  medication \u2013 such as sumatriptan and ergotamine \n  beta-blockers  \u2013 which are used to treat  high blood pressure  and  heart disease  \n some  chemotherapy  medicines \n  decongestants \u00a0 \n the  contraceptive pill   \n medicines used in\u00a0 hormone replacement therapy  \n some types of medicines used\u00a0to treat\u00a0high blood pressure \u2013 such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and clonidine \n \n Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, can also cause secondary Raynaud\u2019s. \n Injury and overuse \n Raynaud's sometimes results from a physical injury. It can also affect musicians, people who type a lot, or other people who use their fingers and hands more than usual. \n Skin and tissue damage caused by\u00a0frostbite can also lead to Raynaud's. \n Smoking \n Smoking cigarettes also increases your risk of developing Raynaud's. Read\u00a0about the  support available to help you quit smoking . \n Vibration white finger \n Vibration white finger is a term used when secondary Raynaud's has been caused by vibration. This typically happens to people who regularly use certain types of vibrating tools, such as:\u00a0 \n \n sanders, grinders and disc cutters \n hammer drills \n chainsaws, hedge trimmers and power mowers \n \n Any vibrating tool that causes tingling or numbness in your fingers could lead to vibration white finger. \n Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from vibration white finger. If the job can't be done without vibrating tools: \n \n ask to use suitable low-vibration tools \n make sure you're using the right tool for the job \n check tools are properly maintained \n keep\u00a0cutting tools sharp \n reduce the amount of time you use the tool in one go by doing other jobs in between \n keep warm at work \n wear anti-vibration gloves \n store tools\u00a0indoors, so they don't have cold handles when next used \n encourage your blood circulation by keeping warm, stopping smoking and massaging and exercising your fingers during your breaks \n \n If you're diagnosed with the condition, tell your employer as soon as possible. If you stop using vibrating tools at an early stage, you may recover fully. \n By law, your employer must contact the  Health and Safety Executive  about your condition. You may be entitled to an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, which is a payment given to people who have become ill or injured as a result of their work. \n See the GOV.UK website for more information about the  Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit .", "treatment": "You can usually treat Raynaud's phenomenon yourself, although medication is sometimes necessary. \n If you've been diagnosed with secondary Raynaud\u2019s, you may be referred to a specialist in the treatment of the underlying condition. \n If your secondary Raynaud\u2019s may be a side effect of a medication, you may be asked to stop taking it, to see if your symptoms improve. \n Self-help \n The following advice is recommended for\u00a0both primary and secondary Raynaud\u2019s. \n \n Keep your whole body warm, especially your hands and feet. Wear gloves and warm footwear in cold weather. \n If you smoke, stop. Quitting smoking will improve your circulation, which should help to improve symptoms. \n Exercise regularly, as this helps to improve your circulation and reduce stress levels (see below). For most people, 150 minutes of vigorous exercise a week is recommended. Read more about  exercise . \n Try to minimise your stress levels. Regular exercise,  eating a healthy diet , and\u00a0 relaxation techniques , such as deep breathing or activities such as  yoga , can help. You may find it useful to avoid stimulants such as coffee, tea and cola. \n \n If you find it difficult to control feelings of stress, you may require additional treatment, such as counselling. Read more about  therapies for stress . \n Medication \n Nifedipine \n If your symptoms fail to improve, you may be prescribed nifedipine. This is the only medicine licensed to treat Raynaud's phenomenon in the UK. It doesn't cure Raynaud's, but can help to relieve the symptoms. \n Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker \u2013 a type of medication that encourages the blood vessels to widen. \n Depending on the pattern of your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment, you may be asked to take your medication every day. Alternatively, you may only need to take it as prevention; for example, during\u00a0a sudden snap of cold weather. \n Side effects are common and include: \n \n oedema \u2013 swelling of certain parts of the body, such as your hands and feet, due to a build-up of fluid \n  headaches  \n  heart palpitations  \n dizziness \n  constipation  \n \n Don't drink grapefruit juice when taking nifedipine, as this could make side effects worse. \n The side effects should improve as your body gets used to the medicine, but tell your GP if you find them particularly troublesome. There are alternative calcium channel blockers that may suit you better. \n Other medications \n Other medications have been used to treat Raynaud\u2019s, but their use is controversial, as there is limited evidence to show they're effective in most people. However, some people have claimed to benefit from treatment. These medications include: \n \n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n fluoxetine \u2013 which was widely used in the treatment of depression \n sildenafil \u2013 which is used to treat erectile dysfunction (inability to get or maintain an erection) \n \n These medicines are not licensed for the treatment of Raynaud's in the UK, but you may be prescribed them if it's thought the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks.\u00a0 \n Surgery \n Surgery for Raynaud's is rare. It's usually only recommended if your symptoms are so severe that there's a risk the affected body part, such as your fingers, could lose their blood supply and begin to die. Read more about the  complications of Raynaud's phenomenon.  \n A type of surgery called sympathectomy is sometimes used. It involves cutting the nerves causing the affected blood vessels to spasm. \n The results of a sympathectomy are often only temporary and further treatment and possibly more surgery may be required after a few years.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Raynaud's phenomenon can usually be diagnosed after an examination of your symptoms and some blood tests. \n Your GP may place your hands in cold water or cool air to see if you show symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s. \n Further testing is usually recommended to find out whether you have primary or secondary Raynaud\u2019s. \n Secondary Raynaud\u2019s may require more treatment and, in some cases, referral to a specialist. \n Secondary Raynaud\u2019s may be suspected if: \n \n your symptoms only started when you were over 30 years of age \u2013 most cases of primary Raynaud\u2019s begin between the ages of 20 to 30 \n you're experiencing severe pain during an attack of Raynaud\u2019s \n only one side of your body is affected \n \n Your GP may also check the tiny blood vessels, known as capillaries, found where your nail meets the finger. These capillaries are often\u00a0larger in people with secondary Raynaud\u2019s, and look like red pen marks. \n Blood tests \n Your GP may also refer you for  blood tests  to check for other health conditions\u00a0that could be causing your symptoms.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Psoriasis", "introduction": "Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. \n These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body.\u00a0Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore. \n Psoriasis affects around 2% of people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults under 35 years old. The condition affects men and women equally. \n The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some people it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have\u00a0a major impact on their quality of life. \n Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or\u00a0mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe. \n Read more about the  symptoms of psoriasis . \n Why it happens \n People with psoriasis have an\u00a0increased production of skin cells. \n Skin cells are normally\u00a0made and replaced every 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3\u00a0to 7\u00a0days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis. \n Although the process isn't fully understood, it's thought\u00a0to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system\u00a0is your body's defence against disease and infection, but for people with psoriasis, it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake. \n Psoriasis can run in families,\u00a0although the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. \n Many people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a \"trigger\". Possible triggers of psoriasis include\u00a0an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines. \n The condition isn't contagious, so it can't be spread from person to person. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of psoriasis . \n How psoriasis is diagnosed \n A GP can\u00a0often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin. \n In rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a  biopsy , will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. This determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis,  lichen planus , lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea. \n You may be referred to a dermatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe. \n If your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specialises in arthritis). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as  rheumatoid arthritis , and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken. \n Treating psoriasis \n There's no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches. \n In most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or  topical corticosteroids . Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin. \n If these aren't effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light. \n In severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body. \n Read more about  treating psoriasis . \n Living with psoriasis \n Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected. \n For example,\u00a0some people with psoriasis have low self-esteem because of the effect the condition has on their appearance. It's also quite\u00a0common\u00a0to develop\u00a0tenderness, pain and swelling in the joints and connective tissue. This is known as psoriatic arthritis. \n Speak to your GP or healthcare team if you have psoriasis and you\u00a0have any concerns about your physical and mental wellbeing. They\u00a0can offer advice and further treatment if necessary. There are also support groups for people with psoriasis, such as  The Psoriasis Association , where you can speak to other people with the condition. \n Read more about  living with psoriasis .", "symptoms": "Psoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness. \n There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only\u00a0one\u00a0form of psoriasis at a time, although 2\u00a0different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe. \n Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping. \n You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis. \n Common types of psoriasis \n Plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) \n This is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed.\u00a0 \n Scalp psoriasis \n This can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary. \n Nail psoriasis \n In about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often\u00a0become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble. \n Guttate psoriasis \n Guttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There's a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis. \n This\u00a0type of psoriasis sometimes\u00a0occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers. \n Inverse (flexural) psoriasis \n This affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather. \n Pustular psoriasis \n Pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body. \n Generalised pustular psoriasis or von Zumbusch psoriasis \n This causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue. \n Palmoplantar pustular psoriasis \n This causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks. \n Acropustulosis \n This causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities. \n Erythrodermic psoriasis \n Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection,  dehydration ,  heart failure ,\u00a0hypothermia and  malnutrition .", "causes": "Psoriasis occurs when skin cells are replaced more quickly than usual. It's not known exactly why this happens, but research suggests it's caused by a problem with the immune system. \n Your body produces new skin cells in the deepest layer of skin. These skin cells gradually move up through the layers of skin until they reach the outermost level. Then they die and flake off. This whole process normally takes around 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0weeks. \n In people with psoriasis, this process only takes about 3\u00a0to 7\u00a0days. As a result, cells that aren't fully mature build up rapidly on the surface of the skin, causing red, flaky, crusty patches covered with silvery scales. \n Problems with the immune system \n Your immune system is your body's defence against disease and it helps fight infection. One of the main types of cell used by the immune system is called a T-cell. \n T-cells normally travel through the body to detect and fight invading germs such as bacteria, but in people with psoriasis they start to attack healthy skin cells by mistake. This causes the deepest layer of skin to produce new skin cells more quickly than usual, which in turn triggers the immune system to produce more T-cells. \n It's not known what exactly causes this problem with the immune system, although certain genes and environmental triggers may\u00a0play a role. \n Genetics \n Psoriasis runs in families. 1\u00a0in 3\u00a0people with psoriasis has a close relative with the condition. \n However, the exact role that genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. Research studies have shown many different genes are linked to the development of psoriasis. It's likely that different combinations of genes may make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop it. \n Psoriasis triggers \n Many people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. Knowing your triggers may\u00a0help you to\u00a0avoid a flare-up. Common triggers include: \n \n an injury to your skin, such as a cut, scrape, insect bite or sunburn (this is known as the Koebner response) \n drinking excessive amounts of alcohol \n smoking \n stress \n hormonal changes, particularly in women (for example, during\u00a0puberty and the  menopause ) \n certain medicines\u00a0such as\u00a0lithium, some antimalarial medicines, anti-inflammatory medicines including  ibuprofen , ACE inhibitors (used to treat high blood pressure) and\u00a0 beta blockers  (used to treat congestive heart failure) \n throat infections \u2013 in some people, usually children and young adults, a form of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis develops after a streptococcal throat infection (although most people who have streptococcal throat infections don't develop psoriasis) \n other immune disorders, such as  HIV ,\u00a0which cause psoriasis to flare up or to appear for the first time \n \n Psoriasis isn't contagious, so it can't be spread from person to person.", "treatment": "Treatment overview \n Treatments are determined by the type and severity of your psoriasis and the area of skin affected. Your\u00a0doctor will probably start with a mild treatment, such as topical creams (which are applied to the skin), and then move on to stronger treatments if necessary. \n A\u00a0wide range of treatments\u00a0are available\u00a0for psoriasis, but identifying which treatment is most effective can be difficult. Talk to your\u00a0doctor if you feel a treatment isn't working or you have uncomfortable side effects. \n Treatments fall into 3\u00a0categories: \n \n topical \u2013 creams and ointments that\u00a0are applied to your skin \n phototherapy \u2013 your skin is exposed to certain types of ultraviolet\u00a0light \n systemic\u2013 oral and injected medications that work throughout the entire body \n \n Often, different types of treatment are used in combination. \n Your treatment for psoriasis may need to be reviewed regularly. You may want to make a care plan (an agreement between you and your health professional)\u00a0as this can help you manage your day-to-day health. \n The various treatments for\u00a0psoriasis are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons of the treatments for psoriasis, allowing you to compare your treatment options. \n Topical treatments \n Topical treatments are usually the first treatments used for mild to moderate\u00a0psoriasis. These are creams and ointments you apply to affected areas.\u00a0 \n Some people find that topical treatments\u00a0are all\u00a0they\u00a0need to control their condition, although\u00a0it may take up to 6\u00a0weeks before\u00a0there's a noticeable effect. \n If you\u00a0have scalp psoriasis, a combination of shampoo and ointment may be recommended. \n Emollients \n Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. If you have mild psoriasis, an emollient is probably the first treatment your GP will suggest. \n The main benefit of emollients is to reduce itching and scaling. Some topical treatments are thought to work better on moisturised skin. It's important to wait at least half an hour before applying a topical treatment after an emollient. \n Emollients are available\u00a0as a wide\u00a0variety of products and can be bought over the counter from a pharmacy\u00a0or prescribed by your GP, nurse or health visitor. \n Steroid creams or ointments \n  Steroid creams or ointments (topical corticosteroids) \u00a0are commonly used to treat mild to moderate psoriasis in\u00a0most areas of the body. The treatment works by reducing inflammation. This slows the production of skin cells and reduces itching. \n Topical corticosteroids range in strength from mild to very strong. Only use topical corticosteroids when recommended by your doctor. Stronger topical corticosteroids can be prescribed by your doctor and should only be used on small areas of\u00a0skin or on particularly thick patches. Overusing topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning. \n Vitamin D analogues \n Vitamin D analogue creams are commonly used along with or instead of\u00a0steroid creams\u00a0for mild to moderate psoriasis affecting areas such as the limbs, trunk or scalp. They work by slowing the production of skin cells. They also have an anti-inflammatory effect. \n Examples of vitamin D analogues are calcipotriol, calcitriol and tacalcitol. There are very few side effects, as long as you don't\u00a0use more than the recommended amount. \n Calcineurin inhibitors \n Calcineurin inhibitors,\u00a0such as\u00a0tacrolimus and pimecrolimus,\u00a0are ointments or creams that reduce the activity of the immune system and help to reduce inflammation. They're sometimes used to treat psoriasis affecting sensitive areas (such as the scalp, the genitals and folds in the skin) if\u00a0steroid creams\u00a0aren't effective. \n These medications can cause skin irritation or a burning and itching sensation when they're started, but this usually improves within a week. \n Coal tar \n Coal tar is a thick, heavy oil and is probably the oldest treatment for psoriasis. How it works isn't exactly known, but it can reduce scales, inflammation and itchiness. It may be used to treat psoriasis\u00a0affecting the limbs, trunk or scalp if other topical treatments aren't effective.\u00a0 \n Coal tar can stain clothes and bedding, and has a strong smell. It can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below). \n Dithranol \n Dithranol has been used for over 50 years to treat psoriasis. It has been shown to be effective in suppressing the production of skin cells and has few side effects. However, it\u00a0can burn if too concentrated. \n It's typically used as a short-term treatment for psoriasis affecting the limbs or trunk under hospital supervision, as it stains everything it comes into contact with, including skin, clothes and bathroom fittings. It's applied to your skin (while wearing gloves) and left for 10\u00a0to 60 minutes before being washed off. \n Dithranol can be used in combination with phototherapy (see below). \n Phototherapy \n Phototherapy uses natural and artificial light to treat psoriasis. Artificial light therapy can be given in hospitals and some specialist centres, usually under the care of a dermatologist. These treatments aren't the same as using a sunbed. \n UVB phototherapy \n Ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy uses a wavelength of light that is invisible to human eyes. The light slows down the production of skin cells and is an effective treatment for some types of psoriasis that haven't responded to topical treatments. Each session only takes a few minutes, but you may need to go to hospital 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0times a week for 6\u00a0to 8\u00a0weeks. \n Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) \n For this treatment, you'll first be given a tablet containing compounds called psoralens, or psoralen may be applied directly to the skin. This makes your skin more sensitive to light. Your skin is then exposed to a wavelength of light called ultraviolet A (UVA). This light penetrates your skin more deeply than ultraviolet B light. \n This treatment may be used if you have severe psoriasis that hasn't responded to other treatment. Side effects of the treatment include nausea, headaches, burning and itchiness. You may need to wear special glasses for 24 hours after taking the tablet to prevent the development of cataracts. Long-term use of this treatment isn't encouraged, as it can increase your risk of developing skin cancer. \n Combination light therapy \n Combining phototherapy with other treatments often increases its effectiveness. Some doctors use UVB phototherapy in combination with coal tar, as the coal tar makes the skin more receptive to light. Combining UVB phototherapy with dithranol cream may also be effective (this is known as Ingram treatment). \n Systemic treatments \n If your psoriasis is severe\u00a0or other treatments haven't worked, you may be prescribed systemic treatments by a specialist. Systemic treatments are\u00a0treatments that work throughout the entire body. \n These medications can be very effective in treating psoriasis, but they all have potentially serious side effects. All the systemic treatments for psoriasis have benefits and risks. Before starting treatment, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any risks associated with them. \n There are 2\u00a0main types of systemic treatment, called non-biological (usually given as tablets or capsules) and biological (usually given as injections). These are described in more detail below. \n Non-biological medications \n Methotrexate \n Methotrexate\u00a0can help to control psoriasis by slowing down\u00a0the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It's usually taken once a week. \n Methotrexate can cause nausea and\u00a0may affect the production of blood cells. Long-term use can cause liver damage. People who have liver disease shouldn't take methotrexate, and you shouldn't drink alcohol when taking it. \n Methotrexate can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it's\u00a0important that women use contraception and don't become pregnant while they take this drug and for 3\u00a0months after they stop. Methotrexate can also affect the development of sperm cells, so men shouldn't father a child during treatment and for 3\u00a0weeks afterwards. \n Ciclosporin \n Ciclosporin is a medicine that suppresses your immune system (immunosuppressant). It was originally used to prevent transplant rejection, but has proved effective in treating all types of psoriasis. It's usually taken daily. \n Ciclosporin increases your chances of kidney disease and high blood pressure, which will need to be monitored. \n Acitretin \n Acitretin is an oral retinoid that reduces the production of skin cells. It's used to treat severe psoriasis that hasn't responded to other non-biological systemic treatments. It's usually taken daily. \n Acitretin\u00a0has a wide range of side effects, including dryness and cracking of the lips, dryness of the nasal passages\u00a0and, in rarer cases,  hepatitis . \n Acitretin can be very harmful to a developing baby, so it's important that women use contraception and don't become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 2\u00a0years after they stop taking it. However, it's safe for a man taking acitretin\u00a0to father\u00a0a baby. \n Biological treatments \n Biological treatments reduce inflammation by targeting overactive cells in the immune system.\u00a0These treatments are usually used if you\u00a0have severe psoriasis that hasn't responded to other treatments, or if you can't use other treatments. \n Etanercept \n Etanercept is injected twice a week and you'll be shown how to do this. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 12 weeks, the treatment will be stopped. \n The main side effect of etanercept is a rash where the injection is given. However, as etanercept affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infection. If you had\u00a0 tuberculosis  in the past, there's a risk\u00a0it may return. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment. \n Adalimumab \n Adalimumab is injected once every 2\u00a0weeks and you'll be shown how to do this. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped. \n Adalimumab can be harmful to a developing baby, so it's important that women use contraception and don't become pregnant while they take this drug, and for 5\u00a0months after the treatment finishes. \n The main side effects of adalimumab include headaches, a rash at the injection site and nausea. However, as adalimumab affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment. \n Infliximab \n Infliximab is given as a drip (infusion) into your vein at the hospital. You'll have 3\u00a0infusions in the first 6\u00a0weeks, then 1\u00a0infusion every 8\u00a0weeks. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 10 weeks, the treatment will be stopped. \n The main side effect of infliximab is a headache. However, as infliximab affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment. \n Ustekinumab \n Ustekinumab is injected at the beginning of treatment, then again 4\u00a0weeks later. After this, injections are every 12 weeks. If there's no improvement in your psoriasis after 16 weeks, the treatment will be stopped. \n The main side effects of ustekinumab are a throat infection and a rash at the injection site. However, as ustekinumab affects the whole immune system, there's a risk of serious side effects, including severe infections. You'll be monitored for side effects during your treatment.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Pressure ulcers", "introduction": "Pressure ulcers are an injury that breaks down the skin and underlying tissue. They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure. \n They are sometimes known as \"bedsores\" or \"pressure sores\". \n Pressure ulcers can range in severity from patches of discoloured skin to open wounds that expose the underlying bone or muscle. \n Read more about the  symptoms of pressure ulcers . \n How pressure ulcers develop \n Pressure\u00a0ulcers can\u00a0develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. They can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time. \n The extra pressure disrupts the flow of blood through the skin. Without a blood supply, the affected skin becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients, and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming. \n Pressure ulcers tend to affect people with health conditions that make it difficult to move, especially\u00a0those confined to lying in\u00a0a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time. \n Conditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as  type 2 diabetes , can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. \n Learn more\u00a0about the\u00a0 causes of pressure ulcers . \n Who is affected? \n It's estimated that just under half a million people in the UK will develop at least 1\u00a0pressure ulcer in any given year. This is usually people with an underlying health condition \u2013 for example, around\u00a01 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with a sudden illness will develop a pressure ulcer. \n People over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin. \n Treating and preventing pressure ulcers \n Treatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. Surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases. \n For some people, pressure ulcers are an inconvenience that require minor nursing care. For others, they can be serious\u00a0and lead to life-threatening complications, such as  blood poisoning  or\u00a0gangrene.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  complications of pressure ulcers . \n Pressure ulcers can be unpleasant, upsetting and challenging to treat. Therefore, a range of techniques\u00a0is used to prevent them developing in the first place. These include: \n \n regularly changing a person's position \n using equipment to protect vulnerable parts of the body \u2013 such as specially designed mattresses and cushions \n \n Read about\u00a0 treating pressure ulcers  and\u00a0 preventing pressure ulcers  for more information. \n Unfortunately, even with the highest standards of care, it's not always possible to prevent pressure ulcers in particularly vulnerable people.", "symptoms": "The parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair. \n For example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your: \n \n shoulders or shoulder blades \n elbows \n back of your head \n rims of your ears \n knees, ankles, heels or toes \n spine \n tail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine) \n \n If you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on: \n \n your buttocks \n the back of your arms and legs \n the back of your hip bone \n \n Severity\u00a0of pressure ulcers \n Healthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. The most common is the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) grading system. The higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue.\u00a0 \n Grade\u00a01 \n A grade 1\u00a0pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. The affected area of skin appears discoloured \u2013 it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. Grade 1\u00a0pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. The skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. It may also\u00a0feel either warm and spongy, or hard. \n Grade\u00a02 \n In grade 2\u00a0pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister. \n Grade\u00a03 \n In grade 3\u00a0pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. The ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound. \n Grade\u00a04 \n A grade 4\u00a0pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged. \n People with grade 4\u00a0pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection.", "causes": "Pressure ulcers are caused by sustained pressure being placed on a particular part of the body. \n This pressure interrupts the blood supply to the affected area of skin. Blood contains oxygen and other nutrients that are needed to help keep tissue healthy. Without a constant blood supply, tissue is\u00a0damaged\u00a0and will eventually die. \n The lack of blood supply also means that the skin no longer receives infection-fighting white blood cells. Once an ulcer has developed, it can become infected by bacteria. \n People with normal mobility do not develop pressure ulcers, as their body automatically makes hundreds of regular movements that prevent pressure building up on any part of their body. \n For example, you may think that you are lying still when asleep, but you may shift position up to 20 times a night. \n Pressure ulcers can be caused by: \n \n pressure from a hard surface \u2013 such as a bed or wheelchair \n pressure that is placed on the skin through involuntary muscle movements \u2013 such as muscle spasms \n moisture \u2013 which can break down the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) \n \n The time it takes for a pressure ulcer to form will depend on: \n \n the amount of pressure \n how vulnerable a person's skin is to damage \n \n Grade 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0pressure ulcers can develop quickly. For example, in susceptible people, a full-thickness pressure ulcer can sometimes develop in just 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0hours. However, in some cases, the damage will only become apparent a few days after the injury has occurred.\u00a0 \n Increased risk \n There are\u00a0several factors\u00a0that increase the risk of\u00a0developing pressure ulcers. These include: \n \n mobility problems \u2013\u00a0anything that affects your ability to move some or all of your body \n poor nutrition \u2013\u00a0for your skin to remain healthy, it requires nutrients that can only be supplied by eating a nutritious diet \n an underlying health condition that disrupts your blood supply or makes your skin more vulnerable to injury and damage \n being over 70 years old \n  urinary\u00a0incontinence  and/or\u00a0 bowel incontinence  \n serious mental health conditions \n \n These are discussed in more detail below. \n Mobility problems \n Possible reasons for having a mobility problem are: \n \n having a spinal cord injury that causes some or all of your limbs to be\u00a0paralysed \n brain damage caused by an event such as a\u00a0 stroke  or  severe head injury , which results in paralysis\u00a0 \n having a condition that is causing progressive damage to the nerves your body uses to move parts of the body \u2013 such as  Alzheimer's disease ,\u00a0 multiple sclerosis (MS)  or  Parkinson's disease \u00a0 \n having severe pain that makes it difficult to move some or all of your body \n having a fractured or broken bone \n recovering from the effects of surgery \n being in a\u00a0 coma  \n having a condition\u00a0that makes it difficult to move your joints and bones \u2013 such as  rheumatoid arthritis \u00a0 \n \n Poor nutrition \n Reasons that your diet may lack nutrition include: \n \n  anorexia nervosa \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a mental health condition where a person has an unhealthy obsession with maintaining a low body weight\u00a0\u00a0 \n  dehydration \u00a0\u2013\u00a0you do not have enough fluids in your body \n  dysphagia \u00a0\u2013\u00a0difficulty swallowing food \n \n Health conditions \n Health conditions that can make you more vulnerable to pressure ulcers include: \n \n  type 1 diabetes  and\u00a0 type 2 diabetes  \u2013\u00a0the high levels of blood sugar associated with diabetes can disrupt normal blood flow \n peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\u00a0\u2013 blood supply in the legs becomes restricted due to a build-up of fatty substances in the arteries \n  heart failure \u00a0\u2013\u00a0previous damage to the heart means it is no longer able to pump enough blood around the body \n  kidney failure \u00a0\u2013\u00a0the kidney loses most or all of its functions,\u00a0which can lead to a build-up of dangerous toxins (poisons) in the blood that\u00a0can cause tissue damage \n  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \u00a0\u2013 a collection of lung diseases; the low levels of oxygen in the blood associated with COPD can make the skin more vulnerable to damage \n \n Ageing skin \n There are several reasons why ageing skin is more vulnerable to pressure ulcers. These include: \n \n with age, the skin loses some of its elasticity (stretchiness), which makes it more vulnerable to damage \n reduced blood flow to the skin, due to the effects of ageing \n the amount of fat under the skin tends to decrease as people get older \n \n Incontinence \n Both urinary incontinence (inability to control your bladder) and bowel incontinence (inability to control your bowels) can cause certain areas of the skin to become moist and vulnerable to infection. This can cause pressure ulcers to form. \n Mental health conditions \n People with severe mental health conditions such as  schizophrenia  (a condition where people have problems telling the difference between reality and imagination) or severe depression have an increased risk of pressure ulcers for a number of reasons. These include: \n \n their diet tends to be poor \n they often have other physical health conditions, such as diabetes or incontinence \n they may neglect their personal hygiene, making their skin more vulnerable to injury and infection", "treatment": "Treatment for pressure ulcers can vary, depending on the grade of the ulcer. Treatment options may include regularly changing your position, or using special mattresses and dressings to relieve pressure or protect the skin. In some cases, surgery may be needed. \n Your care team \n Pressure ulcers are a complex health problem arising from many interrelated factors. Therefore, your care may be provided by a team comprising different types of healthcare professionals. This type of team is sometimes known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). \n Your MDT may include: \n \n a tissue viability nurse (a nurse who specialises in wound care and prevention) \n a social worker \n a physiotherpist \n an  occupational therapist  \n a dietitian \n medical and surgical experts with experience in pressure ulcer management \n \n Changing position \n It's important to avoid putting pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers or where pressure ulcers have already formed. Moving and regularly changing your position helps to prevent pressure ulcers developing and relieves the pressure on\u00a0the ulcers that have developed. \n After your risk assessment is completed, your care team will draw up a \"repositioning timetable\", which states how often you need to be moved. For some people, this may be as often as once every 15 minutes. Others may need to be moved only once every 2\u00a0hours. \n The risk assessment will also consider the most effective way of avoiding putting any vulnerable areas of skin under pressure whenever possible. \n You may also be given training and advice about: \n \n correct sitting and lying positions \n how you can adjust your sitting and lying position \n how often you need to move or be moved \n how best to support your feet \n how to maintain good posture \n the special equipment you should use and how to use it \n \n Mattresses and cushions \n There are a range of special mattresses and cushions that can relieve pressure on vulnerable parts of the body. Your care team will discuss the types of mattresses and cushions most suitable for you. \n Those\u00a0thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, or who have pre-existing grade 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0pressure ulcers, usually benefit from a\u00a0specially designed foam mattress, which relieves the pressure on their body. \n People with a grade 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0pressure ulcer will require a more sophisticated mattress or bed system. For example, there are mattresses that can be connected to a constant flow of air, which is automatically regulated to reduce pressure as and when required. \n Dressings \n Specially designed dressings and bandages\u00a0can be used to protect pressure ulcers and speed up the healing process. Examples of these types of dressings include: \n \n hydrocolloid dressings \u2013\u00a0these contain a special gel that encourages the growth of new skin cells in the ulcer, while keeping the surrounding healthy area of skin dry\u00a0 \n alginate dressings \u2013\u00a0these are made from seaweed and contain sodium and calcium, which are known to speed up the healing process \n \n Creams and ointments \n Topical preparations, such as creams and ointments, can be used to help speed up the healing process and prevent further tissue damage. \n Antibiotics \n If you have a pressure ulcer, you will not routinely be prescribed antibiotics. These are usually only prescribed to treat an infected pressure ulcer and prevent the infection from spreading. \n Antiseptic cream may also be applied directly to pressure ulcers to clear out any bacteria that may be present. \n Nutrition \n Certain dietary supplements, such as protein, zinc and vitamin C, have been shown to accelerate wound healing. \n If your diet lacks these vitamins and minerals, your skin may be more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers. As a result of this, you may be referred to a dietitian so that a suitable dietary plan can be drawn up for you. \n Debridement \n In some cases, it may be necessary to remove dead tissue from the ulcer to help stimulate the healing process. This procedure is known as debridement. \n If there is a small amount of dead tissue, it may be possible to remove it using specially designed dressings and paste. Larger amounts of dead tissue may be removed using mechanical means. Some mechanical debridement techniques include: \n \n cleansing and pressure irrigation \u2013\u00a0where dead tissue is removed using high-pressure water jets \n ultrasound \u2013 dead tissue is removed using low-frequency energy waves \n laser \u2013\u00a0dead tissue is removed using focused beams of light \n surgical debridement \u2013\u00a0dead tissue is removed using surgical instruments, such as scalpels and forceps \n \n A\u00a0 local anaesthetic  will be used to numb the area of skin and tissue around the ulcer so that debridement does not cause any pain or discomfort. \n Maggot therapy \n Maggot therapy, also known as larvae therapy, is an alternative method of debridement. Maggots are ideal for debridement because they feed on dead and infected tissue without touching healthy tissue. They also help to fight infection by releasing substances that kill bacteria and stimulate the healing process. \n During maggot therapy, the maggots are mixed into a wound dressing and the area is covered with gauze. After a few days, the dressing is taken off and the maggots are removed. \n Many people may find the idea of maggot therapy off-putting, but research has found that it is often more effective than more traditional methods of debridement.\u00a0 \n Surgery \n It's not always possible for a grade 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0pressure ulcer to heal. In such cases, surgery will be required to seal the wound and prevent any further tissue damage occurring. \n Surgical treatment involves cleaning the wound and closing it by bringing together the edges of the wound (direct closure), or by using tissue moved from a nearby part of the body (flap reconstruction). \n Pressure ulcer surgery can be challenging, especially because most people who have the procedure are already in a poor state of health. There is a risk of a large number of possible complications occurring after surgery, including: \n \n infection \n tissue death of the implanted flap \n muscle weakness \n  blisters\u00a0 (small pockets of fluid that develop inside the skin) \n recurrence of the pressure ulcers \n blood poisoning \n infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) \n internal bleeding \n abscesses\u00a0(painful collections of pus that develop inside the body) \n  deep vein thrombosis \u00a0(a blood clot that develops inside the veins of the leg) \n \n Despite the risks, surgery is often a necessity to prevent life-threatening complications, such as  blood poisoning  and gangrene (the decay or death of living tissue).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Pressure ulcers are easily diagnosed by looking at them. However, health professionals prefer to prevent ulcers developing in the first place, so it's important to assess a person's risk of developing them. \n As part of the risk assessment process, the following will be considered: \n \n your general health \n your ability to move \n whether you have any problems that may affect your posture \n whether you have any symptoms that may indicate an infection \n your mental health \n whether you have had pressure ulcers in the past \n whether you have\u00a0 urinary incontinence  or  bowel incontinence \u00a0 \n your diet \n how well your blood circulation system is working \n \n As part of the risk assessment, you may be referred for blood and urine tests.\u00a0 Blood tests  can be a good way of assessing your general state of health and whether your diet is providing enough nutrition. \n Urine tests can be used to check how well your kidneys are working and whether you have a  urinary tract infection , which can be a cause\u00a0for concern if you are incontinent or if you have had spinal damage. \n Self-assessment \n If you are thought to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, but you are not staying in a hospital or care home, you may be advised to regularly\u00a0check for early signs of the condition. \n Look out for areas of discolouration and patches of skin that feel unusually spongy or tough to the touch. Use a mirror to check parts of your body that can be difficult to see, such as your back or buttocks. Contact your GP or your healthcare team if you notice any signs of damage."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Psoriatic arthritis", "introduction": "Psoriatic arthritis is a type of\u00a0 arthritis \u00a0that develops in some people with the skin condition\u00a0 psoriasis . It typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful. \n Between 20-40% of people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis affecting the skin affects around 3% of people. \n In most cases, people will experience problems with their skin before they notice any symptoms affecting their joints. In a minority of cases, skin problems may develop after or at the same time as joint problems. \n Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to be a result of the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. It's not clear why some people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis and others don't. \n Signs and symptoms \n The pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the condition often affects particular areas including the \n \n hands \n feet \n knees \n elbows \n neck and spine \n \n Tendons can also be involved \u2013 in some people they may be the major problem. \n Symptoms usually develop slowly meaning that many people are unaware that they are developing psoriatic arthritis. In rarer cases, symptoms can develop suddenly and without warning. \n The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints, whereas others may only notice mild symptoms in one or two joints. \n There may be times when your symptoms improve and periods when they get worse (known as flare-ups or relapses). Some people may reach a point where they have no symptoms at all (known as remission). \n Relapses can be very difficult to predict, but can often be managed with medication when they happen. \n When to seek medical advice \n You should speak to your GP if you experience constant pain, swelling or stiffness in your joints \u2013 even if you haven't been diagnosed with psoriasis. \n If you have been diagnosed with psoriasis, you should have check-ups at least once a year to monitor your condition. Make sure you let your doctor know if you're experiencing any problems with your joints. \n Diagnosing psoriatic arthritis \n If your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment. \n A rheumatologist will usually be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis if you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, and other types of arthritis \u2013 such as\u00a0 rheumatoid arthritis \u00a0and\u00a0 osteoarthritis \u00a0\u2013 have been ruled out. \n A number of tests may be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis, including\u00a0 blood tests \u00a0to check for signs of inflammation in your body and the presence of certain antibodies found in other types of arthritis, as well as\u00a0 X-rays \u00a0or scans of your joints. \n Treating psoriatic arthritis \n The main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life.\u00a0 \n For most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible. \n The main medications used to treat psoriatic arthritis are summarised below. \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n Your GP may first prescribe\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u00a0to see if they help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. \n There are two types of NSAIDs and they work in slightly different ways: \n \n traditional NSAIDs, such as\u00a0 ibuprofen , naproxen or diclofenac \n COX-2 inhibitors (often called coxibs), such as celecoxib or etoricoxib \n \n Like all medications, NSAIDs can have side-effects, but your doctor will take precautions to reduce the risk of these, such as prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms for the shortest time possible. \n If side-effects do happen, they usually affect the stomach and intestines, and can include  indigestion \u00a0and\u00a0 stomach ulcers . A medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that helps protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces will therefore often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs. \n If NSAIDs alone are not helpful, some of the medications below may be recommended. \n Steroid medication (corticosteroids) \n Like NSAIDs,\u00a0 corticosteroids \u00a0can help reduce pain and swelling. \n If you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, your doctor may inject the medication directly into the joint. This can offer rapid relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months. \n Corticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or as an injection into the muscle, to help when lots of joints are inflamed. However, doctors are generally cautious about this because the medication can cause significant side effects if used in the long term, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it. \n Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \n Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are medications that work by tackling the underlying causes of the inflammation in your joints. They can help to ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. The earlier you start taking a DMARD, the more effective it will be.\u00a0 \n Psoriatic arthritis can be treated with a variety of DMARDs including: \n \n Methotrexate \n Sulphasalazine \n Leflunomide \n Cyclosporin \n Antimalarials (such as hydroxychloroquine) \n Azathioprine \n Apremilast \n \n Your rheumatologist will discuss the most appropriate choice of DMARD for you. \n It can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working. Therefore, it's important to keep taking the medication, even if it doesn't seem to be working at first. \n DMARD therapy is monitored according to guidelines such as British Society for Rheumatology (BSR). \n Biological treatments \n Biological treatments are a newer form of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. You may be offered one of these treatments if: \n \n your psoriatic arthritis has not responded to at least two different types of DMARD \n you are not able to be treated with at least two different types of DMARD because of other problems e.g. other diseases. \n \n Biological drugs work by directly blocking the chemicals in the blood, skin and joints that switch the immune system on, leading it to attack the lining of your joints and your skin. \n Some of the biological medicines you may be offered are adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, infliximab and golimumab injections. See our page on\u00a0 treating psoriasis \u00a0for more information about these medications.\u00a0 Newer biological drugs include ustekinumab. \n The most common side-effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area of skin where the medication is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain, although these reactions aren\u2019t usually serious. \n However, biological treatments can sometimes cause other side-effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count, so you'll usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these. \n Biological treatments can make you more likely to develop infections, so you should tell your doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms of an infection, such as a  sore throat , a high temperature (fever), urinary problems or\u00a0 diarrhoea . \n Biological treatments usually take between 2 and 6 months to take effect. \n If it's effective, the medication can be continued. Otherwise, your doctor may suggest stopping the medication or swapping to an alternative biological treatment. \n Complementary therapies \n There isn't enough scientific research evidence to say that complementary therapies, such as balneotherapy (bathing in water containing minerals), works in treating psoriatic arthritis. \n There is also not enough evidence to support taking any kind of food supplement as treatment. \n Complementary therapies can sometimes react with other treatments, so you should talk to your GP, specialist or pharmacist if you're thinking of using any. \n Managing related conditions \n As with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions \u2013 such as\u00a0 cardiovascular disease (CVD) \u00a0\u2013 if you have psoriatic arthritis. CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as\u00a0 heart disease \u00a0and\u00a0 stroke . \n Your doctor should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD and offer additional treatment, if necessary. \n You can also help yourself by: \n \n having a good balance between  rest and regular physical activity  \n losing weight, if you're overweight \n  not smoking  \n only drinking moderate amounts of  alcohol  \n \n Read more about\u00a0 living with psoriasis \u00a0and\u00a0 preventing CVD . \n Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the eyes, such as Conjunctivitis and Iritis. \n If psoriatic arthritis affects your skin and joints, you may notice changes in your nails such as: \n \n dents \n pits \n discolouration \n loosening from the nail bed \n \n This is less common if only your skin is affected. \n Your care team \n As well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by: \n \n  a specialist nurse\u00a0 \u2013 who will often be your first point of contact with your specialist care team \n  a dermatologist (skin specialist)\u00a0 \u2013 who will be responsible for treating your psoriasis symptoms \n  a physiotherapist\u00a0 \u2013 who can devise an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile \n  an occupational therapist\u00a0 \u2013 who can identify any problems you have in everyday activities and find ways to overcome or manage these \n  a psychologist\u00a0 \u2013 who can offer psychological support if you need it \n  a podiatrist  who can offer assessment and advice on foot problems if affected during the course of PSA. \n \n Outlook \n Like psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition that can get progressively worse. \n In severe cases, there is a risk of the joints becoming permanently damaged or deformed, which may require surgical treatment. \n However, with an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it's possible to slow down the progression of the condition and minimise or prevent permanent damage to the joints.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)", "introduction": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. \n Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. \n They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult. \n These symptoms are often severe and\u00a0persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person\u2019s day-to-day life. \n Read more about the  symptoms of PTSD . \n Causes of PTSD \n The type of events that can cause PTSD include: \n \n serious road accidents \n violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery \n prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect \n witnessing violent deaths \n military combat \n being held hostage \n terrorist attacks \n natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis \n \n PTSD\u00a0can develop immediately\u00a0after someone experiences a\u00a0disturbing event or it\u00a0can occur weeks, months or even years later. \n PTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it's not clear exactly why some people develop\u00a0the condition\u00a0and others don't. \n Read more about the  causes of PTSD . \n Complex PTSD \n People who repeatedly experience traumatic situations such as severe neglect, abuse or violence may be diagnosed with complex PTSD. \n Complex PTSD can cause similar symptoms to PTSD and may not develop until years after the event. It's often more severe if the trauma was experienced early in life as this can affect a child's development. \n Read more about  complex PTSD . \n When to seek medical advice \n It's normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but most people improve naturally over a few weeks. \n You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome. \n If necessary, your GP can refer you to mental health specialists for further assessment and treatment. \n How\u00a0PTSD is treated \n PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it\u00a0develops many years after\u00a0a traumatic event. \n Any treatment depends on the severity of\u00a0symptoms and how soon they\u00a0occur after the traumatic event.\u00a0Any of the following treatment options may be recommended: \n \n Watchful waiting \u2013 monitoring your\u00a0symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse without treatment. \n  Psychotherapy  \u2013 such as trauma-focused\u00a0cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR).\u00a0 \n  Antidepressants  \u2013 such as\u00a0paroxetine or\u00a0mirtazapine. \n \n Read more about  treating\u00a0PTSD .", "symptoms": "The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life. \n In most cases, the symptoms develop during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear. \n Some people with PTSD experience long periods when their symptoms are less noticeable, followed by periods where they get worse. Other people have constant, severe symptoms. \n The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below. \n Re-experiencing \n Re-experiencing is the most\u00a0typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event\u00a0in the form of: \n \n flashbacks \n nightmares \n repetitive and distressing images or sensations \n physical sensations \u2013 such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling \n \n Some\u00a0people have\u00a0constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them from coming to terms with the event. \n For example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame. \n Avoidance and emotional numbing \n Trying to avoid being\u00a0reminded of the traumatic event\u00a0is another\u00a0key symptom of PTSD. This usually\u00a0means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience. \n Many people with\u00a0PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies. \n Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy. \n Hyperarousal (feeling 'on edge') \n Someone with\u00a0PTSD may be very\u00a0anxious and find it difficult to relax. They\u00a0may be constantly aware\u00a0of threats and easily startled.\u00a0This state of mind\u00a0is known as\u00a0hyperarousal. \n Hyperarousal\u00a0often\u00a0leads to: \n \n irritability \n angry outbursts \n sleeping problems ( insomnia ) \n difficulty concentrating \n \n Other problems \n Many people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including: \n \n other mental health problems \u2013 such as  depression , anxiety\u00a0or  phobias  \n self-harming or destructive behaviour\u00a0\u2013 such as drug misuse\u00a0or  alcohol misuse  \n other physical symptoms \u2013 such as  headaches , dizziness,\u00a0chest pains and\u00a0 stomach aches  \n \n PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships. \n PTSD in children \n PTSD\u00a0can affect children as well as adults. Children with\u00a0PTSD can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares. \n Like adults, children with PTSD may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy and may have physical symptoms such as headaches and  stomach aches . \n However, there are some symptoms that are more specific to children with PTSD, such as: \n \n bedwetting \n being\u00a0unusually anxious about being separated from\u00a0a parent or other adult \n re-enacting\u00a0the traumatic event(s) through their play \n \n When to seek medical advice \n It's normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally\u00a0over a few weeks. \n You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after\u00a0the traumatic experience, or if\u00a0the symptoms are\u00a0particularly troublesome. \n Your GP will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. They'll ask whether you've experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you've re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares. \n Your GP can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you'd benefit from treatment. See\u00a0 treating PTSD  for more information.", "causes": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop after a very stressful, frightening or distressing event, or after a prolonged traumatic experience. \n Types of events that can lead to PTSD include: \n \n serious road accidents \n violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery \n prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect \n witnessing violent deaths \n military combat \n being held hostage \n terrorist attacks \n natural disasters, such as severe floods, earthquakes or tsunamis \n a diagnosis of a life-threatening condition \n an unexpected severe injury or death of a close family member\u00a0or friend \n \n PTSD\u00a0isn't usually related to\u00a0situations that are simply upsetting, such as divorce, job loss or failing exams. \n PTSD develops in about 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma. It isn't fully understood why some people develop the condition while others don't. However, certain factors appear to make some people more likely to develop PTSD. \n If you've had\u00a0 depression  or\u00a0anxiety in the past, or you don't receive much support from family or friends, you're more susceptible to developing PTSD after a traumatic event. \n There may also be a genetic factor involved in PTSD. For example, having a parent with a mental health problem\u00a0is thought to increase your chances of developing the condition. \n Possible causes \n Although it's not clear exactly why people develop PTSD, a number of possible reasons have been suggested. These are described below. \n Survival mechanism \n One suggestion is that the symptoms of PTSD are the result of an instinctive\u00a0mechanism\u00a0intended to\u00a0help you survive further traumatic experiences. \n For example, the flashbacks many people with PTSD experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you're better prepared if it happens again. The feeling of being \"on edge\" (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis. \n However, while\u00a0these responses may be intended to help you survive, they're actually very unhelpful in reality because you can't process and move on from\u00a0the traumatic experience. \n Adrenaline levels \n Studies have shown that people with PTSD have abnormal levels of stress hormones. \n Normally, when in danger,\u00a0the body produces stress hormones such as adrenaline to\u00a0trigger a reaction in the body. This reaction,\u00a0often known as the \"fight or flight\" reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain. \n People with PTSD have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there's no danger. It's thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with PTSD. \n Changes in the brain \n In people with PTSD, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans. \n One part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus. In people with PTSD, the hippocampus appears smaller in size. It's thought that\u00a0changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks. \n The malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares from being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate doesn't reduce over time. \n Treatment of PTSD results in proper processing of the memories so, over time, the flashbacks and nightmares gradually disappear.", "treatment": "The main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychotherapy and medication. \n Traumatic\u00a0events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and seeking professional help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD. \n It's possible for PTSD to be\u00a0successfully treated many years after the traumatic event occurred, which means it's never too late to seek help. \n Assessment \n Before having treatment for\u00a0PTSD, a detailed assessment of your symptoms will be carried out to ensure treatment is tailored to your individual needs. \n Your GP will often carry out an initial assessment, but you'll be referred to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment\u00a0if\u00a0you've had symptoms of PTSD for more than four weeks or your symptoms are severe. \n There are a number of mental health specialists you may see if you have PTSD, such as: \n \n a psychologist \u2013 an expert in how the mind works \n a community psychiatric nurse \u2013 a nurse who specialises in mental healthcare \n a psychiatrist \u2013 a mental health specialist who diagnoses and treats mental health conditions \n \n Watchful waiting \n If you have mild symptoms of PTSD, or you've had symptoms for less than four weeks, an approach called watchful waiting may be recommended. \n Watchful waiting involves carefully monitoring your symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse. It's\u00a0sometimes recommended because 2 in every 3 people who\u00a0develop problems after a traumatic experience get better within a few weeks without treatment. \n If watchful waiting is recommended, you should have a follow-up appointment within one month. \n Psychotherapy \n If you have PTSD that requires treatment,  psychotherapy \u00a0is usually recommended first. A combination of\u00a0psychotherapy and medication may be recommended\u00a0if you have severe or persistent PTSD. \n Psychotherapy\u00a0is a type of therapy often\u00a0used to\u00a0treat emotional problems and mental health conditions such as PTSD,  depression ,  anxiety \u00a0and  obsessive compulsive disorder . \n The treatment\u00a0is carried out by\u00a0trained mental health professionals who listen to you and help\u00a0you come up\u00a0with effective strategies to resolve your problems. \n The main types of psychotherapy used to treat people with PTSD are described below. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think and act. \n Trauma-focused CBT uses a range of psychological treatment techniques to help you come to terms with the traumatic event. \n For example, your therapist may ask you to confront your traumatic memories by thinking about your experience in detail. During this process your therapist helps you cope with any distress you\u00a0feel, while\u00a0identifying any unhelpful thoughts or misrepresentations you have about the experience. \n Your therapist can help you gain control of your fear and distress by changing the negative way you think about your experience. For example,\u00a0feeling\u00a0you're\u00a0to blame for what happened or fear that it may happen again. \n You may also be encouraged to gradually restart any activities you've avoided since your experience, such as driving a car if you had an accident. \n You'll usually have\u00a08-12 weekly sessions of trauma-focused CBT, although fewer may be needed. Sessions usually last for around 60-90 minutes. \n Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) \n Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a relatively new treatment which has been found to reduce the symptoms of PTSD. \n It involves making side-to-side eye movements, usually by following the movement of your therapist's finger, while recalling the traumatic incident.\u00a0Other methods\u00a0may include\u00a0the therapist tapping their finger or playing a tone. \n It's not clear exactly how EMDR works\u00a0but it may help you to change the negative way you think about a traumatic experience. \n Group therapy \n You may also be offered group therapy as some people find it helpful\u00a0to speak about their experiences with other people\u00a0who also have PTSD. Group therapy can be used to teach you ways to manage your symptoms and help you understand the condition. \n There are also a number of charities\u00a0which provide\u00a0counselling and support groups for PTSD. For example: \n \n  Combat Stress \u00a0\u2013 a military charity specialising in helping ex-servicemen and women \n  Rape Crisis \u00a0\u2013 a UK charity providing a range of services for women and girls who have experienced abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault \n  Victim Support  \u2013 providing support and information to victims or witnesses of crime \n  CRUSE \u00a0\u2013 a UK charity providing support and information for people who have experienced  bereavement  \n \n Medication \n  Antidepressants  such as\u00a0paroxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine, amitriptyline or phenelzine\u00a0are sometimes used to treat PTSD in adults. \n Of these medications, paroxetine and sertraline are the only ones licensed specifically for the treatment of PTSD. However, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and phenelzine have also been found to be effective and may be\u00a0recommended as well. \n However, these\u00a0medications will only be used if: \n \n you choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment \n psychological treatment wouldn't be effective because there's an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence) \n you've gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment \n you have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit from psychological treatment \n \n Amitriptyline or phenelzine will usually only be used under the supervision of a mental health specialist. \n Antidepressants\u00a0can also be prescribed to reduce any associated symptoms of depression and anxiety and to help with sleeping problems. However,\u00a0they're not usually prescribed\u00a0for people younger than\u00a018 unless recommended by a specialist. \n If medication for PTSD is effective, it's usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually withdrawn over the course of four weeks or longer. If a medication\u00a0isn't effective at reducing your symptoms,\u00a0your dosage may be increased. \n Before prescribing a medication, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medication is withdrawn. \n For example, common\u00a0side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea. \n Possible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability. Withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medication is reduced slowly. \n Children and young people \n For\u00a0children and young people with PTSD, trauma-focused CBT is usually recommended. \n This normally involves\u00a0a course of 8-12 sessions that have been adapted to suit the child\u2019s age, circumstances and level of development. Where appropriate, treatment includes consulting with and involving the child's\u00a0family. \n Treatment with medication isn't usually recommended for children and young people with PTSD.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

Talk to your GP about the pros and cons of different treatments so you can decide together what\u2019s best for you. \n Your GP might also want to check your physical health to see if there are any problems that may need to be addressed as well. For instance, you may be anaemic after having given birth and that could add to any feelings of depression you might have. \n Self-help \n Looking after a baby can be stressful and challenging for anyone, and it can be even tougher if you're dealing with postnatal depression as well. \n There are a number of things you can try yourself to improve your symptoms and help you cope. These include: \n \n talk to your partner, friends and family \u2013 try to help them understand how you're feeling and what they can do to support you \n don't try to be a \"supermum\" \u2013 accept help from others when it's offered and ask your loved ones if they can help look after the baby and do tasks such as housework, cooking and shopping \n make time for yourself \u2013 try to do activities that you find relaxing and enjoyable, such as going for a walk, listening to music, reading a book or having a warm bath \n rest when you can \u2013 although it can be difficult when you\u2019re looking after a baby, try to sleep whenever you get the chance, follow  good sleeping habits \u00a0and ask your partner to help with the night-time work \n exercise regularly \u2013 this has been shown to help boost mood in people with mild depression \n eat regular,\u00a0 healthy meals  and don't go for long periods without eating \n don't drink\u00a0 alcohol  or take drugs, as this can make you feel worse \n \n Ask your health visitor about support services in your area. They may be able to put you in touch with a social worker, counsellor or local support group. It can be reassuring to meet other women who are going through something similar. \n  Find postnatal depression support and information in your area . \n Psychological treatments \n Psychological therapies are usually the first treatment recommended for women with postnatal depression. \n The main types used are described below. \n Guided self-help \n Guided self-help involves working through a book or an\u00a0online course on your own or with some help from a therapist. \n The course materials focus on the issues you might be facing, with practical advice on how to deal with them. \n The courses typically last 9 to 12 weeks. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour. \n CBT aims to break this cycle and find new ways of thinking that can help you behave in a more positive way. \n For example, some women have unrealistic expectations about what being a mum is like and feel they should never make mistakes. As part of CBT, you'll be encouraged to see that these thoughts are unhelpful and discuss ways to think more positively. \n CBT can be carried out either one-to-one with a therapist or in a group. Treatment will often last three to four months. \n Interpersonal therapy \n Interpersonal therapy (IPT) involves talking to a therapist about the problems you're experiencing. \n It aims to identify problems in your relationships with family, friends or partners and how they might relate to your feelings of depression. \n Treatment also usually lasts three to four months. \n Antidepressants \n  Antidepressants  may be recommended if you have moderate or severe depression and you don't want to try psychological treatment or psychological treatment\u00a0doesn't help. \n They may also be used if you have mild postnatal depression and a previous history of depression. \n Antidepressants work by balancing mood-altering chemicals in your brain.\u00a0They can help ease symptoms such as low mood, irritability, lack of concentration and sleeplessness, allowing you to function normally and helping you\u00a0cope better with your new baby. \n Antidepressants usually need to be taken for at least a week before the benefit starts to be felt, so it's important to keep taking them even if you don't notice an improvement straight away. You'll usually need to take them for around six months after you start to feel better. If you stop too early, your depression may return. \n Antidepressants and breastfeeding \n If you\u2019re breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about suitable medicines, as not all anti-depressants are safe to take while breastfeeding. \n Your doctor should explain any risks of taking antidepressants and you should be offered the type with the least risk for you and your baby. \n Side effects \n General\u00a0 side effects of\u00a0antidepressants  include: \n \n feeling sick \n blurred vision \n a\u00a0 dry mouth  \n  constipation  \n dizziness\u00a0 \n feeling agitated or shaky \n \n These side effects should pass once your body gets used to the medication. \n Severe postnatal depression \n If your postnatal depression is very severe and it doesn't respond to the treatments above, you'll probably be\u00a0referred to a specialist mental health team. \n Your\u00a0team will be able to try additional treatments, such as: \n \n more intensive CBT \n other psychological treatments, such as\u00a0 psychotherapy  \n therapies such as baby massage to help you bond better with your baby, if this has become a problem \n different medications \n electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\u00a0\u2013 where electrodes are placed on your head and pulses of electricity are sent through\u00a0the brain, which may improve your mood by changing the balance of chemicals in your brain \n \n If it's thought that your depression is so severe that you're at risk of harming yourself or others, you may be admitted to hospital or a mental health clinic. \n Your baby can either be looked after by your partner or family until you're well enough to return home, or you can stay in a specialised  \"mother and baby\" mental health unit .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Prostate cancer", "introduction": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. \n Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years. \n Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis). \n When this happens, you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while urinating and a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied. \n These symptoms shouldn\u2019t be ignored, but they do not mean you definitely have prostate cancer. It is more likely that they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (also known as BPH or  prostate enlargement ). \n Read more about the  symptoms of\u00a0prostate cancer  \n What is the prostate? \n The prostate is a small gland in the pelvis found only in men. About the size of a satsuma, it's located between the penis and the bladder and\u00a0surrounds the urethra. \n The main function of the prostate is to help in the production of semen. It produces a thick white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen. \n Why does prostate cancer happen? \n The causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. However, certain things\u00a0can increase your risk of developing the condition. \n The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as you get older. Most cases develop in men aged 50 or older. \n For reasons not yet understood, prostate cancer is more common in men of African-Caribbean or African descent, and less common in men of Asian descent. \n Men who have\u00a0first degree\u00a0male relatives (such as a father or brother) affected by prostate cancer are also at slightly increased risk. \n Read more about the  causes of prostate cancer  \n Tests for prostate cancer \n There is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you. \n The most commonly used tests for prostate cancer are  blood tests , a physical examination of your prostate (known as a  digital rectal examination or DRE ) and a  biopsy . \n The blood test, known as a\u00a0prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, measures the level of PSA and may help detect early prostate cancer. Men are not routinely offered PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer, as results can be unreliable. \n This is because the PSA blood test is not specific to prostate cancer. PSA can be raised due to a large non-cancerous growth of the prostate (BPH), a urinary tract infection or inflammation of the prostate, as well as prostate cancer. Raised PSA levels also cannot tell a doctor whether a man has life-threatening prostate cancer or not. This means a raised PSA can lead to unnecessary tests and treatment. \n However, you can ask to be tested for prostate cancer once the benefits and risks have been explained to you. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing prostate cancer  and  PSA screening for prostate cancer  \n How is prostate cancer treated? \n For many\u00a0men with prostate cancer, treatment is not immediately necessary. \n If the cancer is at an early stage and\u00a0not causing symptoms, a policy of \"watchful waiting\" or \"active surveillance\" may be adopted. This involves carefully monitoring your condition. \n Some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages. Treatments include surgically removing the prostate,  radiotherapy  and hormone therapy. \n Some cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms. \n All treatment options carry the risk of significant side effects, including  erectile dysfunction  and  urinary incontinence . For this reason, many men choose to delay treatment until there is a risk the cancer might spread. \n Newer treatments,\u00a0such as\u00a0high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)\u00a0or cryotherapy, aim to reduce these side effects.\u00a0Some hospitals may offer them as an alternative to surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy. However, the long-term effectiveness of these treatments are not yet known. \n Read more about  treating prostate cancer  \n Living with prostate cancer \n As\u00a0prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment. \n Nevertheless, it can have an effect on your life. As well as causing physical problems such as  erectile dysfunction  and  urinary incontinence , a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel  anxious  or  depressed . \n You may find it beneficial to talk about the condition with your family, friends, a family doctor and other men with prostate cancer. \n Financial support is also available if prostate cancer reduces your ability to work. \n Read more about  living with prostate cancer", "symptoms": "Prostate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra. \n This normally results in problems associated with urination.

The stage of the cancer will determine which types of treatments will be necessary. \n A widely used method of staging is\u00a0a\u00a0number staging system. The stages are: \n \n Stage 1 \u2013 the cancer is very small and completely within the prostate gland \n Stage 2 \u2013 the cancer is within the prostate gland, but is larger \n Stage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread from the prostate and may have grown into the tubes that carry semen \n Stage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes or another part of the body, including the bladder, rectum or bones; about 20-30% of cases are diagnosed at this stage\u00a0 \n \n If prostate cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of survival are generally good. About 90% of men diagnosed at stages 1 or 2 will live at least five more years and 65-90% will live for at least 10 more years. \n If you are diagnosed with stage 3 prostate cancer, you have a 70-80% of chance of living for at least five more years. \n However, if you are diagnosed when your prostate cancer has reached stage 4, there is only a 30% chance\u00a0you will live for at least five more years. \n  Want to know more?  \n \n Cancer Research UK:  the stages of prostate cancer  \n \n Watchful waiting \n Watchful waiting\u00a0is often recommended for older men when it is unlikely that the cancer\u00a0will affect your natural life span. \n If the cancer is in its early stages and not causing symptoms, you may decide to delay treatment, and wait to see if any symptoms of progressive cancer develop. If this happens, pain medication and hormone medication (see below) to control prostate cancer are usually used. \n Watchful waiting may also be recommended for people with a higher risk of prostate cancer if: \n \n your general health means you are unable to receive\u00a0any form of treatment \n your life expectancy means you will die with the cancer rather than from it \n \n In this case, hormone treatment may be started if there are symptoms caused by the prostate cancer. \n Active surveillance \n Active surveillance aims to avoid unnecessary treatment of harmless cancers, while still providing timely treatment for men who need it. \n When they are diagnosed, we know that around half to two-thirds of men with low-risk prostate cancer do not need\u00a0treatment. Surveillance is a safe strategy that provides a period of observation to gather extra information over time to see whether the disease is changing. \n Active surveillance involves you having regular PSA tests and\u00a0often several\u00a0biopsies to ensure\u00a0any signs of progression are found as early as possible. Sometimes, MRI scans may also be carried out. If these tests reveal the cancer is changing or progressing,\u00a0you can then make a decision about further treatment. \n About\u00a0one in\u00a0three men\u00a0who undergo surveillance will later have treatment. This does not mean they made the wrong initial decision. Good evidence shows\u00a0that active surveillance is safe over an average of six years. Men undergoing active surveillance\u00a0will have delayed any treatment-related side effects, and those who eventually need treatment\u00a0will be reassured\u00a0that it was necessary. \n Radical prostatectomy \n A radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of your prostate gland. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. \n Like any operation, this surgery carries some risks, and there may be some side effects. These are outlined below. \n \n Some men have problems with  urinary incontinence . This can range from leaking small drips of urine, to leaking larger amounts. However, for most men, this usually clears up within three to six months of the operation. About\u00a0two in every 10 men have long-term problems requiring the use of pads. \n Some men have problems getting an erection ( erectile dysfunction ). For some men, this improves with time, but around half of men will have long-term problems. \n In extremely rare cases, problems arising after surgery can be fatal. For example, one in 1,000 men under 65 years old and\u00a0one in 200 men over 65 will die following a radical prostatectomy. \n \n For many men, having a radical prostatectomy will get rid of the cancer cells. However, for around one in three men, the cancer cells may not be fully removed, and the cancer cells may return some time after the operation. \n Studies have shown that radiotherapy after prostate removal surgery may increase the chances of a cure, although research is still being carried out into when it should be used after surgery. \n After a radical prostatectomy, you will no longer ejaculate during sex. This means\u00a0that you will not be able to have a child through sexual intercourse. You may want to ask your doctors about storing a sperm sample before the operation, so\u00a0it can be used later for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). \n Want to know more? \n \n Macmillan:  surgery for early prostate cancer  \n \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0involves using radiation to kill cancerous cells. This treatment is an option for curing localised prostate cancer and locally-advanced prostate cancer. Radiotherapy can also be used to slow the progression of metastatic prostate cancer and relieve symptoms. \n Radiotherapy is normally given as an outpatient at a hospital near you. It is done in short sessions for five days a week, for four to eight weeks. There are short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiotherapy. \n You may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning. \n Short-term effects of radiotherapy can include: \n \n discomfort around the rectum and anus (the opening through which stools pass out of your body) \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n loss of pubic hair \n tiredness \n  cystitis  \u2013 an inflammation of the bladder lining, which can cause you to urinate frequently; urination may be painful. \n \n Possible long-term side effects can include: \n \n an inability to obtain an erection \u2013\u00a0this affects\u00a0about one- to two-thirds\u00a0of men \n urinary incontinence \u2013 this affects about one or two in every 10 men \n back passage problems (diarrhoea, bleeding, discomfort) \u2013 these affect between five and 20 in every 100 men \n \n As with radical prostatectomy, there is a one-in-three chance the cancer will return. In these cases, medication is usually used to control the cancer instead of surgery. This is because there is a higher risk of complications from surgery in men who have previously had radiotherapy. \n Some hospitals now offer new minimally invasive treatments if radiotherapy fails to work, sometimes\u00a0as part of a clinical\u00a0trial. These new treatments are called high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryotherapy. These treatments have fewer side effects, but the long-term outcomes are not yet known. \n Want to know more? \n \n Macmillan:  radiotherapy for early prostate cancer  \n \n Brachytherapy \n Brachytherapy is a form of radiotherapy where the radiation dose is delivered inside the prostate gland. It is also known as internal or interstitial radiotherapy. \n The radiation can be delivered using a number of tiny radioactive seeds that are surgically implanted into the tumour. This is called low dose-rate brachytherapy. \n The radiation can also be delivered through hollow, thin needles placed inside the prostate. This is calld high dose-rate brachytherapy. \n This method has the advantage of delivering a high dose of radiation to the prostate, while minimising damage to other tissues. However, the risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary problems is the same as with radiotherapy, although the risk of bowel problems is slightly lower. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) for prostate cancer  \n \n Hormone therapy \n Hormone therapy is often used in combination with radiotherapy. For example, you may receive hormone therapy before undergoing radiotherapy to increase the chance of a successful treatment. Hormone therapy may also be recommended after radiotherapy to reduce the chances of cancerous cells returning. \n Hormone therapy alone should not normally be used to treat\u00a0localised prostate cancer in men who are fit and willing to receive surgery or radiotherapy. This is because it does not cure the cancer on its own.\u00a0Hormone therapy\u00a0can be used to slow the progression of advanced prostate cancer and relieve symptoms. \n Hormones control the growth of cells in the prostate. In particular, prostate cancer needs the hormone testosterone to grow. The purpose of hormone therapy is to block the effects of testosterone, either by stopping its production or by stopping your body being able to use testosterone. \n Hormone therapy can be given as: \n \n injections to stop your body making testosterone, called luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists \n tablets to block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone, called anti-androgen treatment \n combined LHRH and anti-androgen treatment \n \n The main side effects of hormone treatment are caused by their effects on testosterone. They usually go away when treatment stops. They include\u00a0 loss of sex drive  and  erectile dysfunction  (this is more common with LHRH agonists than anti-androgens). \n Other possible side effects include: \n \n hot flushes \n sweating \n weight gain \n swelling and tenderness of the breasts \n \n An alternative to hormone therapy is to surgically remove the testicles, called orchidectomy. The operation does not cure prostate cancer, but by removing the testosterone, it controls the growth of the cancer and its symptoms. However, many men prefer to have hormone treatment to block the effects of testosterone. \n  Want to know more?  \n \n Cancer Research UK:  hormone therapy for prostate cancer  \n \n Trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) \n During\u00a0TURP, a\u00a0thin metal wire with a loop at the end is inserted into your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to your penis) and pieces of the prostate are removed. \n This is carried out under\u00a0 general anaesthetic  or a spinal anaesthetic (epidural). \n This is done to relieve pressure from the urethra to treat any problematic symptoms you may have with urination. It does not cure the cancer. \n Read more information about\u00a0 transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) . \n High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) \n HIFU is sometimes used to treat men with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate. \n An ultrasound probe\u00a0inserted into the rectum releases high-frequency sound waves through the wall of the rectum. These sound waves kill cancer cells in the prostate gland by heating them to a high temperature. \n The risk of side effects\u00a0from HIFU\u00a0is\u00a0usually lower than other treatments. \n However, possible effects can include impotence (in five to 10 in every 100 men) or urinary incontinence (in less than one in every 100 men). Back passage problems are rare. \n Fistulas (an abnormal channel between the urinary system and rectum) are also rare, affecting less than one in every 500 men. This is because the treatment targets the cancer area only and not the whole prostate. \n However, HIFU treatment is still going through clinical trials for prostate cancer.\u00a0In some cases, doctors can carry out HIFU treatment outside of clinical trials. HIFU is not widely available and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven. \n  Want to know more?  \n \n Cancer Research UK:  high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for prostate cancer  \n \n Cryotherapy \n Cryotherapy is a method of killing cancer cells by freezing them. It is sometimes used to treat men with localised prostate cancer that has not spread beyond their prostate gland. \n Tiny probes called cryoneedles are inserted into the prostate gland through the wall of the rectum. They freeze the prostate gland and kill the cancer cells, but some normal cells also die. \n The aim is to kill cancer cells while causing as little damage as possible to healthy cells. The side effects of cryotherapy can include: \n \n erectile dysfunction \u2013 this can affect between two and nine in every 10 men \n incontinence \u2013 this affects less than one in 20 men \n \n It is rare for cryotherapy to cause\u00a0rectal problems or fistulas. \n Cryotherapy\u00a0is still undergoing clinical trials for prostate cancer. In some cases, doctors can carry out cryotherapy treatment outside of clinical trials.\u00a0It\u00a0is not widely available\u00a0and its long-term effectiveness has not yet been conclusively proven. \n Treating advanced prostate cancer \n If the cancer has reached an advanced stage, it is no longer possible to cure it. However, it may be possible to slow its progression, prolong your life and relieve symptoms. \n Treatment options include: \n \n radiotherapy \n hormone treatment \n chemotherapy \n \n If the cancer has spread to your bones, medicines called bisphosphonates may be used. Bisphosphonates help reduce bone pain and bone loss. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0is mainly used to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) and which is not responding to hormone therapy. \n Chemotherapy destroys cancer cells by interfering with the way they multiply. Chemotherapy does not cure prostate cancer, but can keep it under control and reduce symptoms (such as pain) so everyday life is less affected. \n The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their effects on healthy cells, such as immune cells. They include infections, tiredness, hair loss, sore mouth, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. Many of these side effects can be prevented or controlled with other medicines, which your doctor can prescribe for you. \n Steroids \n Steroid tablets are used when hormone therapy no longer works because the cancer is resistant to it. This is called hormone-refractory cancer. \n Steroids can be used to try to shrink the tumour and stop it from growing. The most effective steroid treatment is dexamethasone. \n Other medical treatments \n There are a number of new medications that could be used if hormones and chemotherapy fail. Your medical team\u00a0can tell you if these are suitable and available for you. \n NICE has recently issued guidance on medications called abiraterone and\u00a0enzalutamide. Both abiraterone and enzalutamide may be used to treat men with metastatic prostate cancer\u00a0that no longer responds to the chemotherapy drug docetaxel. \n Read the NICE guidelines on: \n \n  enzalutamide for metastatic hormone-relapsed prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel  \n  abiraterone for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen  \n \n Deciding against treatment \n As many of the treatments above have unpleasant side effects that can affect your quality of life, you may decide against treatment. This make be especially true if you are at an age when you feel that treating the cancer is unlikely to significantly extend your life expectancy. \n This is entirely your decision, and your MDT will respect it. \n If you decide not to have treatment, your GP and hospital team will still give you support and pain relief. This is called  palliative care . Support is also available for your family and friends.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have symptoms that could be caused by prostate cancer, you should visit your GP. \n There is no single, definitive test for prostate cancer, so your GP\u00a0will discuss the pros and cons of the various tests with you to try to avoid unnecessary anxiety. \n Your doctor is likely to: \n \n ask for a urine sample to check for infection \n take a\u00a0 blood sample  to test your level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) \n examine your prostate ( digital rectal examination ) \n \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected prostate cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n PSA testing \n PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. All men have a small amount of PSA in their blood, and it increases with age. \n Prostate cancer can increase the production of PSA, and so a PSA test looks for raised levels of PSA in the blood that may\u00a0be a sign of the condition\u00a0in its early stages. \n However, PSA testing is not a specific test for prostate cancer. Most men who have prostate cancer will not have a raised PSA level. More than 65% of men with a raised PSA level will not have cancer, as PSA levels rise in all men as they get older. \n Read more about  PSA screening for prostate cancer  \n Digital rectal examination (DRE) \n The next step is a DRE, which can be done by your GP. \n During a DRE, your GP will insert a lubricated and gloved finger into your rectum. The rectum is close to your prostate gland, so your GP can check to feel if the surface of the gland has changed. This will feel a little uncomfortable, but should not be painful. \n Prostate cancer can make the gland\u00a0hard and bumpy. However, in most cases, the cancer causes no changes to the gland and a DRE may not be able to detect the cancer. \n DRE is useful in ruling out\u00a0 prostate enlargement  caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, as this causes the gland to feel firm and smooth. \n Biopsy \n Your GP will assess your risk of having prostate cancer based on a number of factors, including your PSA levels, the results of your DRE, and your age, family history and ethnic group. If you are at risk, you\u00a0should be referred to hospital to discuss the options of further tests. \n The most commonly used test is a transrectal ultrasound-guided\u00a0 biopsy  (TRUS). A biopsy may also be taken during a  cystoscopy examination  or through the skin behind the testicles (perineum). \n During a TRUS biopsy, an ultrasound probe (a machine that uses sound waves to build a picture of the inside of your body) is inserted into your rectum. This allows the doctor or specialist nurse to see exactly where to pass a needle through the wall of your rectum to take small samples of tissue from your prostate. \n The procedure can be uncomfortable and sometimes painful, so you may be given a  local anaesthetic  to minimise any discomfort. As with any procedure, there may be complications, including bleeding and infection. \n Although it is more reliable than a PSA test, the TRUS biopsy\u00a0can have\u00a0problems. It can miss up to one in five cancers, because the location of the cancer is unknown when it is carried out. The doctors can see the prostate using the ultrasound scan, but not the tumour(s) if they are present. \n You may need another biopsy if your symptoms persist, or your PSA level continues to rise. Your doctor may\u00a0request an MRI scan of the prostate before another biopsy. \n The TRUS biopsy can also find small low-risk cancers that do not need treatment, but may cause you anxiety. Many men often choose to undergo surgery or radiotherapy that may not benefit them but causes side effects, such as incontinence and  erectile dysfunction . \n The samples of tissue from the biopsy are studied in a laboratory. If cancerous cells are found, they can be studied further to see how quickly the cancer will spread. This process is known as \"staging and grading\" and helps doctors to decide which treatment is the most appropriate. \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:  the stages of prostate cancer  \n Macmillan:  grading and staging of prostate cancer  \n \n Further testing \n If there is a significant chance\u00a0the cancer has spread from your prostate to other parts of the body, further tests may be recommended. \n These include: \n \n A  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  or  computerised tomography (CT)  scan \u2013 these scans build a detailed picture of the inside of your body. \n An isotope bone scan \u2013 this can tell if the cancer has spread to your bones.

Sometimes the pain is also felt in the shoulder. \n The pain may be worse when you cough, sneeze or move around, and it may be relieved by taking shallow breaths. \n Other symptoms can include\u00a0shortness of breath\u00a0and a dry  cough . \n Visit your GP if you\u00a0experience the above symptoms.\u00a0Seek immediate medical help if your chest pain is severe, particularly if you also have other symptoms, such as coughing up blood, nausea or sweating. \n Seeing your GP \n Pleurisy can usually be diagnosed by studying your symptoms. Your GP can listen to your chest to check for the distinctive dry, crunching sound that suggests you may have pleurisy. \n Further tests may be\u00a0needed to identify the underlying cause of your pleurisy and to assess how severe it is.

It's usually caused by another condition, such as an infection, but sometimes no cause can be identified. \n The pleura are two thin sheets of tissue\u00a0that separate the lungs and ribcage. One is attached to the ribcage and the other is attached to the lungs. \n Between the pleural sheets is a thin layer of liquid that lubricates the pleura, helping to reduce\u00a0friction when you breathe in and out. \n When there's inflammation, the surfaces of the two layers can become rough and the fluid can become sticky. This can cause the layers to rub together, resulting in pain and discomfort. \n Infection \n An infection is the most common cause of pleurisy.\u00a0Any type of infection has the potential to spread to the pleura, but viral infections are usually responsible. Viruses known to\u00a0cause\u00a0pleurisy include: \n \n the  influenza (flu)  virus \n the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which\u00a0causes\u00a0 glandular fever  \n cytomegalovirus (CMV) \u2013 a common virus found in most people, which doesn't usually cause any noticeable symptoms \n parainfluenza \u2013 the virus that causes the childhood condition croup \n \n In some cases, pleurisy is caused by bacteria, such as: \n \n streptococcal bacteria \u2013 often associated with  pneumonia , throat infections and some types of skin infections, such as\u00a0 impetigo  and\u00a0 cellulitis  \n staphylococcal bacteria \u2013 often associated with skin infections,\u00a0 food poisoning  and, more seriously,  blood poisoning (sepsis)  \n \n Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause pleurisy, especially in\u00a0hospital patients. MRSA is a type of bacteria\u00a0with a resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics. \n Other causes \n Other possible causes of pleurisy include: \n \n injury \u2013 if the ribs are bruised or fractured, the pleura can become inflamed \n pulmonary embolism \u2013 a blood clot developing inside the lungs \n  sickle cell anaemia  \u2013 a blood disorder that usually affects\u00a0people of African or Caribbean descent \n  chemotherapy \u00a0and\u00a0 radiotherapy  \n  HIV or AIDS  \n  lung cancer  \n  mesothelioma  \u2013 a type of cancer caused by inhaling asbestos \n \n Autoimmune conditions, such as\u00a0 rheumatoid arthritis  and  lupus , are other possible causes of pleurisy.

Most often,  ibuprofen  is used. \n If NSAIDs are ineffective or unsuitable, you may be prescribed another painkiller, such as\u00a0 paracetamol  or codeine. \n It may seem strange, but lying down on the side of your chest that hurts may also help\u00a0to reduce the pain. \n Treating the underlying cause \n It may also be necessary to treat the underlying cause of your pleurisy. \n If you have pleurisy\u00a0caused by a bacterial infection, you'll need a course of\u00a0 antibiotics . Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may be either\u00a0tablets or injections. Combinations of different antibiotics are sometimes used. \n However, if\u00a0your pleurisy is caused by a viral infection, further treatment may not be required,\u00a0as the infection usually resolves itself after a few days. \n In cases where your symptoms are particularly severe or you're already in poor health, you may need to be admitted to hospital so\u00a0your body\u2019s functions can be supported until your condition stabilises. \n Pleural effusion \n In some cases, pleurisy causes a build-up of excess fluid around the lungs called pleural effusion. \n Pleural effusion can\u00a0result in\u00a0shortness of breath that gets progressively worse. This\u00a0is more likely in cases of pleurisy caused by pulmonary embolism or a bacterial infection. \n If pleural effusion doesn't clear up as your pleurisy is treated, or if you're very short of breath, a tube will need to be inserted so the fluid\u00a0can be drained away. \n The tube\u00a0may\u00a0be inserted using\u00a0either  general anaesthetic  (where you're asleep) or  local anaesthetic  (the area where the tube is inserted is numbed). \n If a lot of fluid has to be drained away,\u00a0you may need to stay in hospital for a few days.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It's more widespread\u00a0in autumn and winter. \n Pneumonia can affect people of any age, but it's more common\u00a0\u2013 and can be more serious\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly. \n People in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia. \n What causes pneumonia? \n Pneumonia is usually the result of\u00a0a\u00a0pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae. \n Many different types of bacteria, including\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi. \n As well as bacterial pneumonia, other types include: \n \n viral pneumonia \u2013 most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and sometimes  influenza  type A or B; viruses are a common cause of pneumonia in young children \n aspiration pneumonia \u2013 caused by breathing in vomit,\u00a0a foreign object, such as a peanut,\u00a0or a harmful substance, such as smoke or a chemical \n fungal pneumonia \u2013\u00a0rare in the UK and more likely to affect people with a weakened immune system \n hospital-acquired pneumonia \u2013 pneumonia that develops in hospital while being treated for another condition or having an operation; people in intensive care\u00a0on breathing machines are particularly at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia \n \n Risk groups \n The following groups have an increased risk of developing pneumonia: \n \n babies and very young children \n elderly people \n people who smoke \n people with other health conditions, such as\u00a0 asthma ,  cystic fibrosis , or a heart, kidney or liver condition \n people with a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example, as a result of a recent illness, such as  flu , having\u00a0 HIV or AIDS , having  chemotherapy ,\u00a0or taking medication following an organ transplant \n \n Diagnosing pneumonia \n Your GP may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. Further tests may be needed in some cases. \n Pneumonia can be difficult to diagnose because it shares many symptoms with other conditions, such as the  common cold ,  bronchitis  and  asthma . \n To help make a diagnosis, your GP may ask you: \n \n whether\u00a0you feel breathless or you're breathing faster than usual \n how long you've had your cough,\u00a0and whether you're coughing up mucus and what colour it is \n if the pain in your chest is worse when you breathe in or out \n \n Your GP may also take your temperature and listen to your chest and back with a stethoscope to check for any crackling or rattling sounds. \n They may also listen to your chest by tapping it. Lungs filled with fluid produce a different sound\u00a0from normal healthy lungs. \n If you have mild pneumonia, you probably won't\u00a0need to have a chest  X-ray  or any other tests. \n You may need a chest\u00a0X-ray or other tests, such as a sputum (mucus) test or  blood tests ,\u00a0if your symptoms haven't improved within 48 hours of starting treatment. \n Treating pneumonia \n Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by: \n \n getting plenty of rest \n taking  antibiotics  \n drinking plenty of fluids \n \n If you don't have any other health problems, you should respond well to treatment and soon recover, although your cough may last for some time. \n As pneumonia isn't usually passed from one person to another, it's safe to be around others, including family members. \n However, people with a weakened immune system should avoid close contact with a person with pneumonia until they start to get better. \n For at-risk groups, pneumonia can be severe and may need to be treated in hospital. \n This is because it can lead to serious complications, which in some cases can be fatal, depending on a person's health and age. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating pneumonia . \n Complications of pneumonia \n Complications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly\u00a0and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as  diabetes . \n Possible complications of pneumonia include: \n \n  pleurisy \u00a0\u2013 where the thin linings between your lungs and ribcage (pleura) become inflamed, which can lead to respiratory failure \n a lung abscess\u00a0\u2013 a rare complication that's mostly seen in people with a serious pre-existing illness or a history of severe  alcohol misuse  \n  blood poisoning (septicaemia) \u00a0\u2013 also a rare but serious complication \n \n You'll be admitted to hospital for treatment if you develop one of these complications. \n Preventing pneumonia \n Although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren't passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading. \n For example, you should: \n \n cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when you cough or sneeze\u00a0 \n throw away used tissues immediately \u2013\u00a0germs can live for several hours after they leave your nose or mouth \n wash your hands regularly to avoid transferring germs to other people or objects \n \n A healthy\u00a0lifestyle can also help prevent pneumonia. For example, you should avoid smoking\u00a0as it damages your lungs and increases the chance of infection. \n Find out\u00a0how to  stop smoking . \n Excessive and prolonged\u00a0 alcohol misuse \u00a0also weakens your lungs' natural defences against infections, making you more vulnerable to pneumonia. \n People at high risk of pneumonia\u00a0should be offered the pneumococcal vaccine\u00a0and flu vaccine.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home with rest, antibiotics and by drinking plenty of fluids.

Experiences of distress or fear during childhood, such as neglect or abuse, are common. \n Types of personality disorder \n Several\u00a0different types of personality disorder are recognised.\u00a0They\u00a0have been\u00a0broadly grouped into one of three clusters \u2013 A, B or C \u2013 which are summarised below. \n Read about the\u00a0 symptoms of personality disorders  for a full list of the main types and signs of personality disorders. \n Cluster A personality disorders \n A person with a cluster A personality disorder tends to have difficulty relating to others\u00a0and usually shows patterns of behaviour\u00a0most people would regard as odd and eccentric. Others may describe them as living in\u00a0a fantasy world of their own. \n An example is paranoid personality disorder, where the person is extremely distrustful and suspicious. \n Cluster B personality disorders \n A person with a cluster B personality disorder struggles to regulate their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others. This can lead to patterns of behaviour others describe as dramatic, unpredictable and disturbing. \n An example is borderline personality disorder, where the person is emotionally unstable, has impulses to self-harm, and has intense and unstable relationships with others. \n Cluster C personality disorders \n A person with a cluster C personality disorder struggles with persistent and overwhelming feelings of fear and anxiety. They\u00a0may show patterns of behaviour most people would regard as antisocial and withdrawn. \n An example is avoidant personality disorder, where the person appears painfully shy,\u00a0socially inhibited, feels inadequate and is extremely sensitive to rejection. The person may want to be close to others,\u00a0but lacks confidence to form a close relationship. \n How many people are affected? \n Personality disorders are common mental health problems. \n In England, it is estimated that around 1 in 20 people has a personality disorder. However, many people have only mild conditions so only need help at times of stress (such as bereavement). Other people with more severe problems may need specialist help for longer periods. \n Outlook \n Many\u00a0people recover from personality disorders over time. Psychological or medical treatment is sometimes helpful; sometimes support is all that is needed. This depends on the severity of the disorder and whether there are ongoing problems. \n Some\u00a0mild to moderate personality disorders improve with  psychotherapy . \n Different types of psychological therapies have been shown to help people with personality disorders. However, there is no single approach that suits everyone and treatment should be tailored to the individual. Not all talking therapies are effective and it is essential\u00a0they are delivered by a trained therapist. \n Read more\u00a0information about  treating a personality disorder", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It's estimated that one in every 1,200 people develop the condition every year. \n Polymyalgia rheumatica is\u00a0age-related. Most people who are diagnosed with the condition are over 70. It's extremely rare in people younger than 50. It's also more common in women than men. \n Treating polymyalgia rheumatica \n The main treatment for\u00a0polymyalgia rheumatica is a\u00a0 coritcosteroid medication  called prednisolone, which is used to help relieve the symptoms. \n You'll\u00a0initially\u00a0be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone, which will be reduced gradually over time. \n Most people with polymyalgia rheumatica will need to take a long-term course of corticosteroid treatment\u00a0(lasting 18 months to two years) to prevent their symptoms returning. \n Read more about  treating polymyalgia rheumatica .", "symptoms": "The most common symptom of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is pain and stiffness in the shoulder muscles, which develops quickly over a few days or weeks. \n The muscles in the neck and\u00a0hips are also often affected.

It doesn't cure polymyalgia rheumatica, but it can help\u00a0relieve the symptoms. \n When used to treat polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisolone is taken as a tablet. Most people will be prescribed several tablets to take once a day. \n You'll be prescribed a high dose of prednisolone initially, and the dose will be gradually reduced every one to two months. \n Although your symptoms should improve within a few days of starting treatment, you'll probably\u00a0need to continue taking\u00a0a low dose of prednisolone for\u00a0about two years. \n In many cases, polymyalgia rheumatica improves on its own after this time. However, there's a chance that the condition will return (relapse)\u00a0once treatment stops. \n Don't suddenly stop taking steroid medication unless a doctor in charge of your care tells you it's safe to do so. Suddenly stopping treatment with steroids can make you feel very ill. \n Side effects of prednisolone \n About\u00a0one in 20 people who take prednisolone will experience changes in their mental state when they take the medication. \n You may feel\u00a0 depressed  and\u00a0 suicidal , anxious or confused. Some people also experience hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there). Contact your GP as soon as possible if you experience changes to your mental state.\u00a0 \n Other side effects of prednisolone include: \n \n increased appetite that often leads to weight gain \n increased blood pressure \n mood changes, such as becoming aggressive or\u00a0irritable with people \n weakening of the bones ( osteoporosis ) \n  stomach ulcers \u00a0 \n increased risk of infection, particularly with the\u00a0varicella-zoster virus (the virus that causes\u00a0 chickenpox  and\u00a0 shingles )\u00a0 \n \n Seek immediate medical advice if you think you've been exposed to the varicella-zoster\u00a0virus, or if a member of your household develops chickenpox or shingles. \n The risk of these side effects should improve as your dose of prednisolone is decreased. \n See\u00a0 side effects of corticosteroids  for more information about how these side effects may affect you and how they're treated. \n Other medications \n Sometimes, other medicines may be combined with corticosteroids to help prevent relapses or to allow your dose of prednisolone to be reduced. \n Some people are prescribed immunosuppressant medication, such as methotrexate. This is used to reduce or suppress the immune system (the body's defence against infection and illness). It may be helpful for people with polymyalgia rheumatica who have frequent relapses or don't respond to normal steroid treatment. \n Your doctor may recommend painkillers, such as  paracetamol , or  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , to help relieve pain and stiffness while your dose of prednisolone is reduced. \n Follow-up \n Your GP will ask you to attend regular follow-up appointments to check how well you're responding to treatment, whether your dose of prednisolone needs to be adjusted, and how well you're coping with the side effects of the medication. \n During these appointments, you'll have\u00a0 blood tests  to check the levels of inflammation inside your body. \n Follow-up appointments are usually recommended every few weeks for the first three months and then at three- to six-monthly intervals after this time. \n Contact your GP if your symptoms return\u00a0during any part of your treatment.

Sometimes, the ESR may be normal and CRP may be raised, which would be more likely to indicate a positive diagnosis. This is why both tests are usually carried out at the same time. \n As inflammation is a characteristic of many conditions, high levels don't automatically mean that you have polymyalgia rheumatica. Further tests may be needed to help rule out other conditions that cause inflammation. For example, a test for  rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies , may be carried out to rule out rheumatoid arthritis. \n Blood tests can also help determine: \n \n whether there's an infection in your blood \n how well some of your organs, such as your kidneys, are working \n whether you have an  overactive thyroid gland  or an  underactive thyroid gland  (both conditions can cause muscle pain) \n \n You may also have a urine test to check how well your liver is functioning. \n  X-rays  and  ultrasound scans  may also be used to look at the condition of your bones and joints. \n Symptom checklist \n After other possible causes of your symptoms have been ruled out, a checklist can be used to see whether your symptoms match those most commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. \n A confident diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica can usually be made if you meet all of the following criteria: \n \n you're over 50 years of age\u00a0 \n you have pain in your shoulders or your hips \n you have stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes \n your symptoms have lasted longer than two weeks \n blood tests show raised levels of inflammation in your body \n your symptoms rapidly\u00a0improve after treatment with\u00a0 corticosteroids  \n \n Read more about  treating polymyalgia rheumatica ."},

This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy. \n Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes. For example, it can be caused by: \n \n physical injury to the nerves \n a\u00a0viral infection such as\u00a0 shingles  \n a side effect of certain medications or\u00a0drinking too much\u00a0alcohol \n \n People who are known to be at an\u00a0increased risk of peripheral neuropathy may have regular check-ups so their nerve function can be assessed. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of peripheral neuropathy  \n Treating\u00a0peripheral neuropathy \n Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause. \n Only some of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated. For example, if you have diabetes it may help to gain better control\u00a0of your\u00a0blood sugar level, stop smoking and cut down on alcohol. \n Nerve pain may be treated with prescribed medications called neuropathic pain agents, as standard painkillers are often ineffective. \n If you have other symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy, these may need to be treated individually. For example, treatment for muscle weakness may involve physiotherapy\u00a0and the use of walking aids. \n Read more about  treating peripheral neuropathy . \n Complications of peripheral neuropathy \n The outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged. \n Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas\u00a0in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time. \n If the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy isn't treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. This can lead to gangrene (tissue death) if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the affected foot has to be amputated. \n Peripheral neuropathy may\u00a0affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy).

For example: \n \n diabetes can sometimes be controlled by lifestyle changes, such as stopping smoking, cutting down\u00a0on alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly \n  vitamin B12 deficiency  can be treated with B12 injections or tablets \n peripheral neuropathy caused by a medication you're taking may improve if the medication is stopped \n \n Some less common types of peripheral neuropathy may be treated with medication, such as: \n \n  corticosteroids \u00a0\u2013 powerful anti-inflammatory medication \n immunosuppressants\u00a0\u2013 medications that reduce the activity of the immune system \n injections of immunoglobulin\u00a0\u2013 mixture of blood proteins called antibodies made by the immune system \n \n However, the underlying cause may not always be untreatable. \n Relieving nerve pain \n You may also require medication to treat any nerve pain (neuropathic pain)\u00a0you're experiencing. \n Unlike most other types of pain, neuropathic pain doesn't usually get better with common painkillers, such as  paracetamol  and\u00a0 ibuprofen \u00a0and other medications are\u00a0often used. \n These should usually be started at the minimum dose, with the dose gradually increased until you notice an effect, because\u00a0the ideal dose for each person is unpredictable. Higher doses may be\u00a0better at managing the pain, but are also more likely to cause side effects. \n The most common side effects are tiredness, dizziness or feeling \"drunk\". If you get these, it may be necessary to reduce your dose. Don't drive or operate machinery\u00a0if you experience drowsiness or blurred vision. You also may become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol. \n The side effects should improve after a week or two as your body gets used to the medication. However, if your side effects continue, tell your GP\u00a0as it may be possible to change to a different medication that suits you better. \n Even if the first medication tried doesn't help, others may. \n Many of these medications may also be used for treating other conditions, such as depression, epilepsy, anxiety or headaches. If you're given an  antidepressant , this may treat pain even if you're not depressed.\u00a0This doesn't mean your doctor suspects you're depressed. \n The main medications recommended for neuropathic pain include: \n \n amitriptyline\u00a0\u2013 also used for treatment of\u00a0 headaches  and\u00a0 depression  \n duloxetine\u00a0\u2013\u00a0also used for treatment of bladder problems and depression \n pregabalin and gabapentin\u00a0\u2013 also used\u00a0to treat  epilepsy , headaches or\u00a0 anxiety  \n \n There are also some additional medications that can be used to relieve pain in a specific area of the body or to relieve particularly severe pain for short periods. These are described below. \n Capsaicin cream \n If your pain is confined to a particular area of your body and you can't, or would prefer not to,\u00a0take the medications above, you may benefit from using capsaicin cream. \n Capsaicin is the substance that makes chilli peppers hot and is thought to work in neuropathic pain by stopping the nerves sending pain messages to the brain. \n A pea-sized amount of capsaicin cream is rubbed on the painful area of skin three or four times a day. \n Side effects of capsaicin cream can include skin irritation and a burning sensation in the treated area when you first start treatment. \n Don't use capsaicin cream on broken or inflamed skin and always wash your hands after applying it. \n Lidocaine plaster \n This is a large sticking plaster that contains a local anaesthetic. It's useful when pain affects only a small area of skin. It's stuck over the area of painful skin and the local anaesthetic is absorbed into the skin that's covered. \n Tramadol \n Tramadol is a powerful painkiller related to morphine that can be used to treat neuropathic pain that doesn't respond to other treatments your GP can prescribe. \n Like all opioids, tramadol can be addictive if it's taken for a long time. It will usually only be prescribed for a short time.\u00a0Tramadol can be useful to take at times when your pain is worse. \n Common side effects of tramadol include: \n \n feeling sick or\u00a0vomiting \n dizziness \n constipation \n \n Treating other symptoms \n In addition to treating pain, you may also require treatment to help you manage other symptoms you're experiencing as a result of peripheral neuropathy. \n For example, if you have muscle weakness, you may need physiotherapy\u00a0to learn exercises to improve your muscle strength. You may also need to wear splints to support weak ankles or use walking aids to help you get around. \n Other problems associated with peripheral neuropathy\u00a0may be treatable with medication, such as: \n \n  erectile dysfunction  \n constipation \n the slow movement of food through your stomach (gastroparesis) \n \n In some cases, you may need more invasive treatment, such as botulinum toxin injections for  hyperhidrosis \u00a0or  urinary catheterisation  if you have problems emptying your bladder.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "A number of tests may be used to diagnose peripheral neuropathy and its underlying cause. \n When you see your GP,\u00a0they'll\u00a0ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area of your body. This may involve testing sensation, strength and reflexes. \n Your doctor may\u00a0also arrange blood tests, especially to check for\u00a0causes such as  diabetes \u00a0or  vitamin B12 deficiency . \n Confirming if you have a neuropathy \n Some people may need to see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system)\u00a0in hospital for further tests such as: \n \n a nerve conduction test (NCS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where\u00a0small metal wires called electrodes are placed on your skin which release tiny electric shocks that stimulate your nerves; the speed and strength of the nerve signal is measured \n electromyography\u00a0(EMG)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small needle is inserted through your skin into your muscle and used to measure the electrical activity of your muscles \n \n NCS and EMG\u00a0are usually carried out at the same time. \n Identifying the cause of a neuropathy\u00a0 \n Your GP can usually identify the underlying cause of a peripheral neuropathy. \n If diabetes is suspected, they can usually make a confident diagnosis based on\u00a0your symptoms, a physical examination and checking the levels of glucose in your blood and urine. \n If you're taking a medication known to cause peripheral neuropathy, your GP may\u00a0temporarily stop or reduce your dose to see whether your symptoms improve. \n If the cause is uncertain, you may be referred to a neurologist for more extensive blood tests to check: \n \n whether you have a rare acquired cause that may be responsible \n whether you have a genetic abnormality, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease \n \n You may need a\u00a0 lumbar puncture  to test the cerebrospinal fluid (a clear, colourless fluid that surrounds and supports the brain and spinal cord) for inflammation. \n Further tests \n Occasionally, a nerve\u00a0 biopsy  may be carried out as part of your diagnosis. This is a minor surgical procedure where a small sample of a peripheral nerve is removed from near your ankle so it can be examined under a microscope. \n It's then checked for changes\u00a0that could be a sign of certain types of peripheral neuropathy. However, nerve biopsies are rarely needed. \n You may also need\u00a0a scan to look for any underlying cause of your neuropathy, such as: \n \n an  X-ray  \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Penile cancer", "introduction": "Penile cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs on the skin of the penis or within the penis. \n In the UK, around 550 men are diagnosed with cancer of the penis each year. It most commonly affects men over 60 years of age. \n Over the last 30 years, the number of penile cancer cases has increased by more than 20%, possibly due to changes in sexual practices. \n However, improvements in diagnosis, staging and treatment have led to a similar reduction in the number of deaths resulting from the condition. \n Signs and symptoms \n You\u00a0should be aware of any abnormalities or signs of penile cancer, including: \n \n a growth or sore on the penis that doesn't heal within four weeks\u00a0 \n bleeding from the penis or from under the foreskin \n a foul smelling discharge \n thickening of the skin of the penis or foreskin that makes it difficult to draw back the foreskin (phimosis) \n a change in the colour of the skin of the penis or foreskin \n a rash on the penis \n \n If you experience these symptoms, it's important that they're checked by your GP as soon as possible. It's unlikely they'll be\u00a0caused by cancer of the penis, but they need to\u00a0be investigated. \n Any delay in diagnosing penile cancer could reduce the chances of successful treatment. \n Types of penile cancer \n The penis is made up of many different types of tissue. The type of\u00a0penile cancer you have will depend on the type\u00a0of cell the\u00a0cancer developed from. \n The most common types of penile cancer include: \n \n squamous cell penile cancer \u2013 which accounts for more than 90% of cases and starts in the cells that cover the surface of the penis \n carcinoma in situ (CIS) \u2013 a particular type of squamous cell cancer where only the cells in the skin of the penis are affected and it hasn't spread any deeper \n adenocarcinoma \u2013 cancer that starts in the glandular cells of the penis that produce sweat \n melanoma of the penis \u2013 where the cancer develops in the skin cells that give the skin its colour \n \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about the different  types of penile cancer . \n What causes penile cancer? \n The cause of penile cancer isn't known, but certain risk factors can increase your chances of getting it. \n Men who carry the\u00a0human papilloma virus (HPV)\u00a0have an increased risk of developing penile cancer, which is the virus that causes  genital warts . \n Studies have found\u00a0that almost 5 out of 10 men (47%) with penile cancer also have an HPV infection. \n Age is also a risk factor for cancer of the penis. The condition rarely affects men under 40 years of age, and most commonly occurs in men aged over 60. \n Smoking is the most\u00a0significant lifestyle factor associated with penile cancer. Chemicals found in cigarettes can damage cells in the penis, which increases your\u00a0risk of getting the condition. \n Conditions that affect the penis, such as phimosis, which\u00a0makes the foreskin\u00a0difficult to retract, increase your chances of developing infections such as balantis. \n Repeated infections are linked to a higher risk of developing some types of penile cancer, because they can weaken your immune system. \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about the  risks and causes of penile cancer . \n Diagnosing penile cancer \n Your GP will ask you about any symptoms you have and when they occur. They'll also examine your penis for signs of penile cancer. \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of penile cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected penile cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n If your GP suspects penile cancer, they\u00a0may refer you to\u00a0a specialist \u2013 usually a urologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the urinary system and genitals). \n The specialist will ask about your symptoms\u00a0and check your medical history. They may also check for any physical signs of penile cancer. \n A  blood test  may be carried out to check your general health and the number of blood cells. \n To confirm a diagnosis of penile cancer, you may need to have a  biopsy . A\u00a0small tissue sample will be removed so it can be examined under a microscope\u00a0for cancerous cells. \n Treating penile cancer \n Treatment for penile cancer will depend on the size of the affected area and the rate at which the cancer has\u00a0spread. \n For example, in most cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS), where only the skin cells of the penis are affected, treatment will usually involve either using a\u00a0chemotherapy cream or having laser surgery to remove the affected area of skin. You will usually have\u00a0a\u00a0skin graft after surgery. \n The main treatments for penile cancer that isn't at a very early stage are: \n \n surgery \n  radiotherapy  \n  chemotherapy  \n \n Surgery will involve removing the cancerous cells and possibly some of the surrounding tissue. \n In most cases, any physical changes to your penis after an operation can be corrected with reconstructive surgery. Skin and muscle can be taken from elsewhere in the body to recreate a functioning penis. \n However, with early diagnosis and modern surgical techniques, your surgeon will usually be able to preserve as much penile tissue as possible. \n As part of most treatments for penile cancer, the lymph glands (small organs that are part of the immune system) in the groin will be assessed to determine if the cancer has spread. \n The test that's used, known as a sentinel node   biopsy, is widely available in the UK. In some cases, the lymph glands may need to be surgically removed. \n As with most types of cancer, the outlook for individual cases depends largely on how far the cancer has advanced at the time of diagnosis. \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about\u00a0 staging penile cancer  and the  types of treatment for cancer of the penis . \n You can also read about  penile cancer \u00a0on the male cancer website\u00a0 Orchid . They also have a helpline you can call \u2013 0203 465 5766 (Monday to Friday, 9am-5.30pm). \n Prevention \n It isn't always possible to prevent penile cancer, but you can reduce your chances of getting it. \n One\u00a0of the main\u00a0ways you can reduce\u00a0your chances of developing penile cancer is to\u00a0 give up smoking  (if you smoke). \n It's also important to maintain\u00a0good penis hygiene to prevent the bacterial and viral infections that\u00a0can increase the risk of penile cancer. \n This is easier if you were circumcised as a child, but there are steps you can take if you haven't been circumcised. Simple penis hygiene can include: \n \n using\u00a0 condoms  to help reduce the possibility of catching HPV \n regularly\u00a0washing your penis with warm water, including under the foreskin \n \n There's little evidence to suggest that being circumcised as an adult will reduce your chances of developing penile cancer. However, if you have sores that don't heal, or if it's becoming increasingly difficult to\u00a0clean under your foreskin, seek advice from your GP\u00a0about the possibility of circumcision.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Pelvic organ prolapse", "introduction": "Pelvic organ prolapse is bulging of one or more of the pelvic organs into the vagina. \n These organs are the uterus, vagina, bowel and bladder. \n Symptoms may include: \n \n a sensation of a bulge or something coming down or out of the vagina, which sometimes needs to be pushed back \n discomfort during sex \n problems\u00a0passing urine\u00a0\u2013 such as slow stream, a feeling of not emptying the bladder fully, needing to urinate more often and leaking a small amount of urine when you cough, sneeze or exercise ( stress incontinence ) \n \n Some women with a pelvic organ prolapse don't have any symptoms and the condition is only discovered during an internal examination for another reason, such as a  cervical screening . \n When to see your GP \n Pelvic organ prolapse isn't life-threatening, but it can affect your quality of life. \n See your GP if you have any of the symptoms of a prolapse, or if you notice a lump in or around your vagina. \n Internal pelvic examination \n Your doctor will need to carry out an internal pelvic examination.\u00a0They'll ask you to undress from the waist down and lie back on the examination bed, while they feel for any lumps in your pelvic area. \n Some women may put off going to their GP if they're embarrassed or worried about what the doctor may find. However, the examination is important, only takes a few minutes and is similar to having a smear test. \n Further tests \n If you have bladder symptoms, such as needing to rush to the toilet or leaking when you cough and sneeze, further tests\u00a0may need to be\u00a0carried out in hospital. \n For example, a small tube (catheter) may be inserted into your bladder to examine your bladder function and identify any leakage problems. This test is known as urodynamics. \n Your doctor will decide if\u00a0further tests are needed before treating the prolapse. \n Types of prolapse \n If pelvic organ prolapse is confirmed, it will usually be staged to indicate how severe it is. Most often, a number system is used, ranging from\u00a0one to four, with\u00a0four indicating a severe prolapse. \n Pelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of the vagina. The main types of prolapse are: \n \n anterior prolapse (cystocele) \u2013 where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the\u00a0vagina \n prolapse of the uterus and cervix or top of the vagina \u2013 which can\u00a0be the result of previous treatment to remove the womb ( hysterectomy ) \n posterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) \u2013 when the\u00a0bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina \n \n It's possible to have more than one of these\u00a0types of prolapse\u00a0at the same time. \n Why does prolapse happen? \n Prolapse is caused by weakening of tissues that support the pelvic organs. Although there's rarely a single cause,\u00a0the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse can be increased by: \n \n your age \u2013 prolapse is more common as you get older \n childbirth, particularly if you had a long or difficult labour, or gave birth to multiple babies or a large baby\u00a0\u2013\u00a0up to half of all women who have had children are affected by some degree of prolapse \n changes caused by the  menopause \u00a0\u2013 such as weakening of tissue and low levels of the hormone oestrogen \n being overweight,  obese \u00a0or having large  fibroids  (non-cancerous tumours in or around the womb) or pelvic cysts\u00a0\u2013 which creates extra pressure in the pelvic area \n previous pelvic surgery\u00a0\u2013 such as a hysterectomy\u00a0or bladder repair \n repeated heavy lifting and manual work \n long-term coughing or sneezing \u2013 for example, if you smoke, have a lung condition or allergy \n excessive straining when going to the toilet because of long-term  constipation  \n \n Certain\u00a0conditions\u00a0can also\u00a0cause the tissues in your body to become weak, making a prolapse more likely, including: \n \n  joint hypermobility syndrome \u00a0\u2013 where your joints are very loose \n  Marfan syndrome \u00a0\u2013 an inherited condition that affects the blood vessels, eyes and skeleton \n  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome \u00a0\u2013 a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body \n \n Can\u00a0a prolapse be prevented? \n There are\u00a0several things you can do to reduce your risk of prolapse, including: \n \n doing regular  pelvic floor exercises  \n maintaining a healthy weight or  losing weight \u00a0if you're overweight \n eating a\u00a0 high-fibre diet  with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain bread and cereal to avoid\u00a0 constipation  and straining when going to the toilet \n avoiding heavy lifting \n \n If you smoke,\u00a0 stopping smoking \u00a0may also help to reduce your risk of a prolapse. \n How is prolapse treated? \n Many women with prolapse don't need treatment, as the problem doesn't seriously interfere with their normal activities. \n Lifestyle changes such as weight loss\u00a0and pelvic floor exercises\u00a0are usually recommended in mild cases. \n If the symptoms require treatment, a prolapse may be treated effectively using a device inserted into the vagina, called a vaginal pessary. This helps to hold the prolapsed organ in place. \n Surgery may also be an option for some women. This usually involves giving support to the prolapsed organ.\u00a0In some cases, complete removal of the womb\u00a0(hysterectomy) is required, especially if the womb has prolapsed out. \n Most women experience a better quality of life after surgery, but there's a risk of problems remaining or even getting worse.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "There are several treatment options available for a pelvic organ prolapse, depending on your circumstances. \n The treatment most suitable for you depends on: \n \n the severity of your symptoms \n the\u00a0severity of the prolapse \n your age and health \n whether you're planning to have children in the future \n \n You may not need any treatment if your prolapse is mild to moderate and not causing any pain or discomfort. \n The various treatments for\u00a0pelvic organ prolapse\u00a0are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Self care advice \n If your prolapse is mild, there are some steps\u00a0you can take that\u00a0may help improve\u00a0it or\u00a0reduce the risk of\u00a0it getting worse. \n This may\u00a0include: \n \n doing regular pelvic floor exercises (see below) \n  losing weight \u00a0if you're overweight, or maintaining a healthy weight for your build (you can check your body mass index (BMI) using the  BMI chart ) \n eating a high-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and wholegrain bread and cereal to avoid\u00a0 constipation  and straining when going to the toilet \n avoiding heavy lifting and standing up for long periods of time \n \n If you smoke, giving up will help, because\u00a0 coughing \u00a0can make a prolapse worse. Read guidance on\u00a0 stopping smoking \u00a0for more information. \n Pelvic floor exercises \n The pelvic floor muscles are a group of muscles that wrap around the underside of the bladder and rectum. \n Having weak or damaged pelvic floor muscles can make a prolapse more likely. Recent evidence suggests that pelvic floor exercises may help to improve a\u00a0mild prolapse or reduce the risk of it getting worse. \n Pelvic floor exercises are also used to treat urinary incontinence (when you leak urine), so may be useful if this is one of your symptoms. \n Read more about  treating urinary incontinence  \n To help\u00a0strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, sit comfortably on a chair with your knees slightly apart.\u00a0Squeeze the muscles\u00a0eight times in a row and\u00a0perform these contractions three times a day. Don't hold your breath or tighten your stomach, buttock, or thigh muscles at the same time. \n When you get used to doing this, you can try holding each squeeze for a few seconds (up to 10 seconds). Every week, you can add more squeezes, but be careful not to overdo it and always have a rest inbetween sets of squeezes. \n Your doctor may refer you to a physiotherapist, who can teach you how to do pelvic floor exercises. It\u00a0usually takes at least three months before you notice any improvement. \n Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \n While there's little evidence that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can directly treat pelvic organ prolapse, it can relieve some of the symptoms associated with prolapse, such as vaginal dryness or discomfort during sex. \n HRT increases the level of oestrogen in women who have been through the\u00a0 menopause . \n HRT medication is available as: \n \n a cream\u00a0you apply to your vagina \n a tablet\u00a0you insert into your vagina \n a patch\u00a0you stick on your skin \n an implant\u00a0inserted under your skin \n \n HRT is used for women\u00a0with prolapse\u00a0after\u00a0menopause who have the symptoms described above. Creams, tablets or pessaries may be used for a short time to improve these symptoms.\u00a0 \n Vaginal pessaries \n A vaginal ring pessary is a device\u00a0inserted into the vagina to hold the prolapse back. It works by holding the vaginal walls in place. Ring pessaries are usually made of latex (rubber) or silicone and come in different shapes and sizes. \n Ring pessaries may be an option if your prolapse is more severe, but you would prefer not to have surgery. A gynaecologist (a specialist in treating conditions of the female reproductive system) or a specialist nurse usually fits a pessary. \n The pessary may need to be removed and replaced every\u00a0four to six\u00a0months. \n Side effects \n Ring pessaries can occasionally cause vaginal discharge, some irritation and possibly bleeding and sores inside your vagina. Other side effects include: \n \n passing a small amount of urine when you cough, sneeze or exercise (stress incontinence) \n difficulty with bowel movements \n interference with having sex,\u00a0although most women can have intercourse without any problems \n an imbalance of the usual bacteria found in your vagina ( bacterial vaginosis ) \n \n These side effects can usually be treated. \n Surgery \n Surgery may be an option for treating a prolapse\u00a0if it's felt the possible benefits outweigh the risks. \n Surgery for pelvic organ prolapse is\u00a0relatively common. It's estimated that 1 in 10 women will have surgery for prolapse by the time they're 80 years old. \n These procedures are outlined below. \n Surgical\u00a0repair \n One of the main surgical treatments for pelvic organ prolapse involves improving\u00a0support for the pelvic organs. \n This may involve stitching prolapsed organs back into place and supporting the\u00a0existing tissues to make them stronger. \n Pelvic organ repair\u00a0may be done through cuts (incisions) in the vagina. It's usually carried out under  general anaesthetic , so you'll be asleep during the operation and won't feel any pain. \n If you're planning to have children and have a prolapse, your doctors may\u00a0suggest delaying\u00a0surgery until you're sure you no longer want to have any more children. This is because pregnancy can cause the prolapse to recur. \n Vaginal mesh \n Surgery for pelvic organ prolapse may not always be successful and the prolapse can return. \n For this reason, synthetic (non-absorbable) and biological (absorbable) meshes have been introduced\u00a0to support the vaginal wall and/or internal organs. About 1,500 such operations are carried out in the UK each year. \n The majority of women treated with mesh respond well to this treatment. However, the Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes. These are mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel. \n If you've recently had vaginal mesh inserted and think there may be complications, or you want to find out about the risks involved, speak to your GP. You can also\u00a0 report a problem with a medicine or medical device  on the GOV.UK website. \n If you're thinking about having vaginal mesh inserted,\u00a0you may want to ask your surgeon some of these questions before you proceed: \n \n What are the alternatives? \n What are the chances of success with the use of mesh versus use of other procedures? \n What are the pros and cons of using mesh, and what are the pros and cons of alternative procedures? \n What experience have you had with implanting mesh? \n What have been the outcomes from the people you have treated? \n What has been your experience in dealing with any complications that might occur? \n What if the mesh doesn't correct my problems? \n If I have a complication related to the mesh, can it be removed and what are the consequences associated with this? \n Do you know what happens to the mesh over time? \n \n Hysterectomy \n If the womb (uterus) is prolapsed, then removing it during an operation called\u00a0a\u00a0 hysterectomy \u00a0often helps the surgeon to give better support to the rest of the vagina and reduce the chance of a prolapse returning. \n A hysterectomy will usually only be considered in women who don't wish to have any more children, as\u00a0you can't get pregnant after having a hysterectomy. \n Methods to elevate and support the uterus without removing it do exist, but these need to be discussed with your doctor. \n Complications from surgery \n All types of surgery carry some risks. Your surgeon will explain these in more detail, but possible complications could include: \n \n risks associated with  anaesthesia  \n bleeding, which may\u00a0require a  blood transfusion  \n damage to the surrounding organs, such as your bladder or\u00a0bowel \n an infection\u00a0\u2013 you may be given  antibiotics  to take during and after surgery to reduce the risk of infection \n pain during sex, usually caused by\u00a0narrowing of the vagina \n vaginal discharge and bleeding \n experiencing more prolapse symptoms,\u00a0which may require further surgery \n a blood clot forming in one of your veins (for example, in your leg)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may be given medication to help reduce this risk after surgery (see\u00a0 deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  for more information) \n \n Recovering from surgery \n Most prolapse operations require an overnight stay in hospital. More major operations, such as a hysterectomy, may require\u00a0a few nights in hospital. \n If you need to stay in hospital, you may have a drip in your arm to provide fluids and a thin plastic tube called a\u00a0 catheter  to drain urine from your bladder. Some gauze\u00a0may be placed inside your vagina to act as a bandage for the first 24 hours. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Your stitches will usually dissolve on their own after a few weeks.\u00a0 \n For the first few days or weeks after your operation, you may have some vaginal bleeding\u00a0similar to a period. You may also have some vaginal discharge. This may last three or four weeks. During this time, you should use sanitary towels rather than tampons. \n Enhanced recovery \n Enhanced recovery is an NHS initiative to improve patient outcomes after surgery and speed up recovery. \n This involves careful planning and preparation before surgery, as well as reducing the stress of surgery, by: \n \n using pain relief to minimise pain \n avoiding unnecessary drips, tubes and drains \n enabling you to eat and drink straight after your operation \n encouraging early mobilisation \n \n Post-surgery advice \n Even with enhanced recovery, there may still be some activities you need to avoid while you recover from surgery. Your care team can advise about activities you may need to avoid, such as heavy lifting and strenuous exercise, and for how long. \n Generally, most people are advised to\u00a0move around as soon as possible,\u00a0with good rests every few hours. \n You can usually shower and bathe as normal after leaving hospital, but you may need to avoid swimming for a few weeks. \n It's best to avoid having sex for around four to six weeks, until you've healed completely. \n Your care team will advise\u00a0about when you can return to work. \n Problems with recovery \n Contact your GP if you experience: \n \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over \n severe pain low in your tummy \n heavy vaginal bleeding \n a stinging or burning sensation when you pass urine\u00a0 \n abnormal vaginal discharge, as this may be an infection", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

This\u00a0leads to a reduction\u00a0in a chemical called dopamine in the brain. \n Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. \n Exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible. \n Read more about the  causes of Parkinson's disease  \n Who's affected? \n It's thought around 1 in 500 people are affected by Parkinson's disease, which means\u00a0there are an estimated 127,000 people in the UK with the condition. \n Most people with Parkinson's start to develop symptoms when they're over 50, although around 1 in 20 people with the condition first experience symptoms\u00a0when they're under 40. \n Men are slightly more likely to get Parkinson's disease than women. \n Treating\u00a0Parkinson's disease \n Although there's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible. \n These include: \n \n supportive treatments\u00a0\u2013 such as physiotherapy\u00a0and  occupational therapy  \n medication \n in some cases, brain\u00a0surgery \n \n You may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson's disease, as symptoms are usually mild. However, you may need regular appointments with your specialist so your condition can be monitored. \n Read more about  treating Parkinson's disease  \n Outlook \n As the condition progresses,\u00a0the symptoms of Parkinson's disease\u00a0can get worse and it can become increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities without assistance. \n Many\u00a0people respond well to treatment and only experience mild to moderate disability, whereas the minority may not respond as well and can, in time, become\u00a0more severely disabled. \n Parkinson's disease\u00a0doesn't directly cause people to die, but the condition can place great strain on the body, and can make some people more vulnerable to serious and life-threatening infections. \n However, with advances in treatment, most people with Parkinson's disease now have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. \n Read more about  living with Parkinson's disease  \n It may also\u00a0be useful to read\u00a0 your guide to care and support \u00a0\u2013\u00a0written for people with care and support needs, as well as their carers and relatives.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of Parkinson's disease usually develop gradually and are mild at first. \n There are many different symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. Some of the more common symptoms are described below. \n However,\u00a0the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual.\u00a0It's unlikely that\u00a0a person\u00a0with Parkinson's disease would experience all or\u00a0most of these. \n Main symptoms \n The three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease affect physical movement: \n \n tremor\u00a0\u2013 shaking, which usually begins in the hand or arm and is more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and\u00a0resting \n slowness of movement (bradykinesia) \u2013 where physical movements are much slower than normal, which can make everyday tasks difficult and can result in a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps \n muscle stiffness (rigidity) \u2013 stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it difficult to move around and make facial expressions, and can result in painful muscle cramps ( dystonia ) \n \n These main\u00a0symptoms are sometimes referred to by doctors as parkinsonism as there can be causes other than Parkinson's disease. \n Other symptoms \n Parkinson's disease can also cause a range of other physical and mental symptoms. \n Physical symptoms \n \n balance problems \u2013 these can make someone with the condition more likely to have a  fall  and injure themselves \n loss of sense of smell (anosmia)\u00a0\u2013 sometimes occurs several years before other symptoms develop \n nerve pain \u2013\u00a0can cause unpleasant sensations, such as burning, coldness or numbness \n problems with urination \u2013 such as having to get up frequently during the night to urinate or\u00a0unintentionally passing urine ( urinary incontinence ) \n  constipation  \n an inability to obtain or sustain an erection ( erectile dysfunction )\u00a0in men\u00a0 \n difficulty becoming sexually aroused and achieving an orgasm\u00a0(sexual dysfunction) in women \n  dizziness , blurred vision or fainting\u00a0when moving from a sitting or lying position to a standing one\u00a0\u2013\u00a0caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure \n excessive sweating ( hyperhidrosis ) \n swallowing difficulties ( dysphagia )\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can lead to  malnutrition  and  dehydration  \n excessive production of saliva (drooling) \n problems sleeping ( insomnia )\u00a0\u2013 this can result in excessive sleepiness during the day \n \n Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms \n \n  depression  and  anxiety  \n mild cognitive impairment \u2013 slight memory problems and problems with activities that require planning and organisation \n  dementia  \u2013 a group of symptoms, including more severe memory problems, personality changes,\u00a0seeing things that aren't there (visual hallucinations) and\u00a0believing things that aren't true (delusions) \n \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you're concerned you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease. \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your medical history to help them decide whether it's necessary to refer you to a specialist for further tests. \n Read more about  diagnosing Parkinson's disease", "causes": "Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. \n Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger between the parts of the brain and nervous system that help control and co-ordinate body movements. \n If these nerve cells die or become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means the part of the brain controlling movement can't work as well as normal, causing movements to become slow and abnormal. \n The loss of nerve cells is a slow process.\u00a0The symptoms of Parkinson's disease\u00a0usually only start to develop when around 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost. \n What causes the loss of nerve cells? \n It's not known why the loss of nerve cells associated with Parkinson's disease occurs, although research is ongoing to identify potential causes. \n Currently, it's believed a combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be responsible for the condition. \n Genetics \n A number of genetic\u00a0factors have been shown to\u00a0increase a person's risk of developing Parkinson's disease, although exactly how these make some people more susceptible to the condition is unclear. \n Parkinson's disease can run in families as a result of faulty genes being passed to\u00a0a child by their parents. However, it's rare for the disease to be inherited this way. \n Environmental factors \n Some researchers also feel environmental factors may increase a person's risk of developing Parkinson's disease. \n It's been suggested that pesticides and herbicides used in farming\u00a0and traffic or industrial pollution may contribute to the condition. \n However, the evidence linking environmental factors to Parkinson's disease is inconclusive. \n Other causes of parkinsonism \n \"Parkinsonism\" is the umbrella term used to describe the symptoms of tremors, muscle rigidity and slowness of movement. \n Parkinson's disease is the most common type of parkinsonism, but there are also some rarer types where a specific cause can be identified. \n These include parkinsonism caused by: \n \n medication (drug-induced parkinsonism) \u2013 where symptoms develop after taking certain medications, such as some types of antipsychotic medication, and usually improve once the medication is stopped \n other progressive brain conditions \u2013 such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy, and\u00a0corticobasal degeneration \n cerebrovascular disease \u2013 where a series of small  strokes  cause several parts of the brain to die \n \n You can read more about  parkinsonism  on the Parkinson's UK website.", "treatment": "There are several therapies that can make living with Parkinson's disease easier and help you deal with your symptoms on a day-to-day basis. \n There are efforts underway to try to increase the availability of these supportive therapies for Parkinson's patients on the NHS. \n Your local authority may be able to advise and help you. Ask your local authority for a care and support needs assessment. \n Physiotherapy \n A physiotherapist can work with you to relieve muscle stiffness and joint pain through movement (manipulation) and exercise. \n The physiotherapist aims to make moving easier, and improve your walking and flexibility. They also try to improve your fitness levels and ability to manage things for yourself. \n Occupational therapy \n An occupational therapist can identify areas of difficulty in your everyday life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, dressing yourself or getting to the local shops. \n They can help you work out practical solutions, and ensure your home is safe and properly set up for you. This will help you maintain your independence for as long as possible. \n Read more about  occupational therapy  \n Speech and language therapy \n Many people with Parkinson's disease have swallowing difficulties ( dysphagia )\u00a0and problems\u00a0with their speech. \n A speech and language therapist can often help\u00a0you improve these problems by teaching speaking and swallowing exercises, or by providing assistive technology. \n Diet advice \n For some people with Parkinson's disease, making dietary changes can help improve some symptoms. \n These changes\u00a0can include: \n \n increasing the amount of fibre in your diet and making sure you're drinking enough fluid to reduce\u00a0 constipation  \n increasing the amount of salt in your diet and eating small, frequent meals to avoid problems with\u00a0 low blood pressure , such as\u00a0 dizziness  when you stand up quickly \n making changes to your diet to avoid\u00a0unintentional weight loss \n \n You may see a dietitian, a healthcare professional trained to give diet advice, if your care team thinks you\u00a0may benefit from changing your diet. \n Medication \n Medication\u00a0can be used to\u00a0improve the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as shaking (tremors) and movement problems. \n However, not all the medications available are useful for everyone, and the short- and long-term effects of each are different. \n Three main types of medication are commonly used: \n \n levodopa \n dopamine agonists \n monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors \n \n Your specialist can explain your medication options, including the risks associated with each medication, and discuss which may be best for you. Regular reviews will be required as the condition progresses and your needs change. \n Read on to learn about the treatments you may be offered. You can also see a summary of the pros and cons of treatments for Parkinson's disease, where you can compare your options. \n Levodopa \n Most people with Parkinson's disease eventually need a medication called levodopa. \n Levodopa is absorbed by the nerve cells in your brain and turned into the chemical dopamine, which is used to transmit messages between the parts of the brain and nerves that control movement. \n Increasing the levels of dopamine using levodopa usually improves movement problems. \n It\u00a0is usually taken as a tablet or liquid, and is often combined with other medication, such as benserazide or carbidopa. \n These medications stop the levodopa being broken down in the bloodstream before it has a chance to get to the brain. \n They also reduce the side effects of levodopa, which include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting \n tiredness \n dizziness \n \n If you're prescribed levodopa, the initial dose\u00a0is usually very small and will be gradually increased until it takes effect. \n At first, levodopa can cause a dramatic improvement in the symptoms. \n However, its effects can be less long-lasting over the following years\u00a0\u2013\u00a0as more nerve cells in the brain are lost, there are fewer of them to absorb the medicine. This means the dose may need to be increased from time to time. \n Long-term use of levodopa is also linked to problems such as uncontrollable, jerky muscle movements (dyskinesias) and \"on-off\" effects, where the person rapidly switches between being able to move (on) and being immobile (off). \n Dopamine agonists \n Dopamine agonists act as a substitute for dopamine in the brain and have a similar but milder effect compared\u00a0with levodopa. They can often be given less frequently than levodopa. \n They\u00a0are often taken as a tablet, but are also available as a skin patch (rotigotine). \n Sometimes dopamine agonists are taken at the same time as levodopa, as this allows lower doses of levodopa to be used. \n Possible side effects of dopamine agonists include: \n \n nausea or vomiting \n tiredness and sleepiness \n dizziness \n \n Dopamine agonists can also cause hallucinations and\u00a0increased confusion, so they need to be used with caution, particularly in elderly patients, who are more susceptible. \n For some people, dopamine agonists have been linked to the development of compulsive behaviours,\u00a0especially at high doses, including addictive gambling and an excessively increased libido. \n Talk to your healthcare specialist if you think you may be experiencing these problems. \n As the person themselves may not realise the problem, it's key that carers and family members also note any abnormal behaviour and discuss it with an appropriate professional at the earliest opportunity. \n If you're prescribed a course of dopamine agonists, the initial dose is usually very small to prevent nausea and other side effects. \n The dosage is gradually increased over a few weeks. If nausea becomes a problem, your GP may prescribe anti-sickness medication. \n A potentially serious, but uncommon, complication of dopamine agonist therapy is sudden onset of sleep. \n This generally happens as the dose is being increased and tends to settle once the dose is stable. \n People are\u00a0usually advised to\u00a0avoid driving while the dose is being increased in case this complication occurs. \n Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors \n Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, including selegiline and rasagiline, are another alternative to levodopa for treating early Parkinson's disease.\u00a0 \n They block the effects of an enzyme or\u00a0brain substance that breaks down\u00a0dopamine (monoamine oxidase-B), increasing dopamine levels. \n Both selegiline and rasagiline can improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, although their effects are small compared with levodopa. They can be used alongside levodopa or dopamine agonists. \n MAO-B inhibitors are generally very well tolerated, but can occasionally\u00a0cause side effects, including: \n \n nausea \n headache \n abdominal pain \n high blood pressure \n \n Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors \n Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors are prescribed for people in later stages of Parkinson's disease. They prevent levodopa from being broken down by the enzyme COMT. \n Side effects of COMT inhibitors include: \n \n nausea or vomiting \n diarrhoea \n abdominal pain \n \n Non-oral therapies \n When Parkinson's symptoms become difficult to control with tablets alone, a number of other treatments can be considered. \n Apomorphine \n A dopamine agonist called apomorphine can be injected under the skin (subcutaneously) either\u00a0by: \n \n a single injection, when required \n a continuous infusion\u00a0using a small pump carried around on your belt, under your clothing, or in a bag \n \n Duodopa \n If you have severe on-off fluctuations, a type of levodopa called duodopa may be used. \n This medication comes as a gel that's continuously pumped into your gut through a tube inserted through your abdominal wall. \n There's an external pump attached to the end of the tube, which you carry around with you. \n About 25 specialist neuroscience centres in the UK offer this treatment.\u00a0This treatment is only available if you have very severe on-off fluctuations or involuntary movements. \n Surgery \n Most people with Parkinson's disease are treated with medication, although a type of surgery called deep brain stimulation is\u00a0used in some cases. \n This surgery is also available in specialist neuroscience centres around the UK, but it's not suitable for everyone. \n If\u00a0surgery is\u00a0being considered, your specialist will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you. \n Deep brain stimulation \n Deep brain stimulation involves surgically implanting a pulse generator similar to a heart pacemaker into your chest wall. \n This is connected to one or two fine wires placed under the skin, and is\u00a0inserted precisely into specific areas in your brain. \n A tiny electric current is produced\u00a0by the pulse generator, which runs through the wire and stimulates the part of your brain affected by Parkinson's disease. \n Although surgery doesn't cure Parkinson's disease, it can ease the symptoms for some people. \n Treating additional symptoms \n As well as\u00a0the main symptoms of movement problems, people with Parkinson's disease can experience a wide range of additional symptoms that may need to be treated separately. \n These include: \n \n depression and anxiety \u2013 this can be treated with self care measures such as exercise, psychological therapy or medication; read more about\u00a0 treating depression  \n problems sleeping (insomnia) \u2013 this can be improved by making changes to your normal bedtime routine; read more about  treating insomnia  \n erectile dysfunction \u2013 this can be treated with medication; read more about  treating erectile dysfunction  \n excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis) \u2013 this can be reduced using a prescription antiperspirant,\u00a0or surgery in severe cases; read more about  treating hyperhidrosis  \n swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) \u2013\u00a0this can be improved by eating softened food, or by using a feeding tube in more severe cases; read more about  treating dysphagia  \n excessive drooling \u2013 this can be improved with swallowing exercises, or surgery or medication in severe cases \n urinary incontinence \u2013 this can be treated with exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, medication, or surgery in severe cases; read more about  treating urinary incontinence  \n dementia \u2013\u00a0this can be treated with cognitive therapies and medication in some cases; read more about  treating dementia  \n \n Clinical trials \n Much progress has been made in the treatment of Parkinson's disease\u00a0as the result of\u00a0clinical trials,\u00a0where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones. \n All clinical trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they are worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials sometimes do better overall than those in routine care. \n If you are asked if you want to take part in a trial, you will be given an information sheet about the trial. \n If you want to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. You can refuse to take part or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care. \n Complementary and alternative therapies \n Some people with Parkinson's disease find\u00a0complementary therapies help them feel better. Many complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. \n However, there's no clinical evidence they're effective in controlling the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. \n Most people think complementary treatments have no harmful effects. However, some can be harmful and they shouldn't be used instead of the medicines prescribed by your doctor. \n Some types of herbal remedies, such as St John's wort, can interact unpredictably if taken with some types of medication used to treat Parkinson's disease. \n If you're considering using an alternative treatment along with your prescribed medicines, check with your care team first.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "No tests can conclusively show that you have Parkinson's disease.

It's uncommon\u00a0in people under 40 years of age. \n \u00a0 \n Symptoms of pancreatic cancer \n In the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn't usually cause any symptoms, which\u00a0can make it difficult to diagnose. \n It's important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren't usually the result of cancer.\u00a0But you should contact your GP if you're concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly. \n The first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often: \n \n pain in the back or stomach area\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you've eaten \n unexpected weight loss \n jaundice\u00a0\u2013 the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes;\u00a0it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured \n \n Other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: \n \n nausea and vomiting \n bowel changes \n fever and shivering \n indigestion \n blood clots \n \n You may also develop symptoms of  diabetes \u00a0if you have\u00a0pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin. \n Endocrine pancreatic cancer \n There are also a\u00a0number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces. \n Cancer Research UK has more information on  symptoms of endocrine pancreatic tumours . \n Causes of pancreatic cancer \n It's not fully understood what causes pancreatic cancer, but a number of risk factors for developing the condition have been identified. \n Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include: \n \n age\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it mainly affects people who are 50-80 years of age\u00a0 \n  smoking \u00a0\u2013 around\u00a0one in three cases\u00a0is associated with using cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco \n having a history of certain health conditions\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as  diabetes ,  chronic pancreatitis  (long-term inflammation of the pancreas),  stomach ulcer  and Helicobacter pylori infection (a stomach infection) \n \n In about 1 in 10 cases, pancreatic cancer is inherited from a person's parents. Certain genes also increase your chances of getting pancreatitis, which in turn increases your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas. \n  Cancer Research UK \u00a0has more information on: \n \n  genetic risk factors for pancreatic cancer  \n  other possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer  \n \n Diagnosing pancreatic cancer \n Your GP will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. They\u00a0may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged. \n They'll also check your skin and eyes\u00a0for signs of\u00a0jaundice and\u00a0may request a urine sample and  blood test . \n If your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you'll usually be referred to a specialist at a hospital for further investigation. You may have either: \n \n an  ultrasound scan  \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \n a\u00a0positron emission tomography (PET) scan\u00a0\u2013 where you're given an injection of a very small amount of radioactive medication, known as a tracer, which helps to show up cancers in an image \n \n Depending on the results of a scan, further tests may include: \n \n an\u00a0endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS)\u00a0endoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a type of endoscopy\u00a0which allows\u00a0close-up ultrasound pictures to be taken of your pancreas\u00a0 \n an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\u00a0\u2013 a type of endoscopy\u00a0which is used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts; the dye will show up on an\u00a0 X-ray  and highlight any tumours \n a\u00a0laparoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to see inside your body using a laparoscopy\u00a0(a thin,\u00a0flexible microscope) \n \n A\u00a0 biopsy , where a small sample is taken from a suspected tumour, may also be carried out during these procedures. \n NICE guidelines \n In 2015, the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. \n To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n Treating pancreatic cancer \n Cancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat. It\u00a0rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it's often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. If the tumour is\u00a0large, treating the cancer will be more difficult. \n If you've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, your treatment\u00a0will depend on the type and location of your cancer, and how far it's advanced. Your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration. \n The first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells. If this isn't possible, treatment will focus on preventing the\u00a0tumour growing and causing further harm to your body. \n The three main treatments for pancreatic cancer are: \n \n surgery \n  chemotherapy  \n  radiotherapy  \n \n Some types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require two types of treatment or a combination of all three. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating pancreatic cancer . \n Recovering from surgery \n Recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process. \n You'll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief. \n After any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won't be able to eat or drink straight away. \n You'll gradually be able to sip fluids, before eventually being able to drink and eat more regularly. You may\u00a0be referred to a dietitian, who can advise you about what foods you should eat following your operation. \n After the tumour has been removed, you'll probably have a six-month course of  chemotherapy , which greatly increases your chance of being cured.\u00a0But because\u00a0cancer of the pancreas is difficult to diagnose and treat, many people don't recover\u00a0completely. \n Treatment can be very effective in helping to ease symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. Chemotherapy can help shrink your tumour and slow down its growth.", "symptoms": "In its early stages, pancreatic cancer rarely causes symptoms. \n The pancreas is actually two glands in one, and symptoms depend on which part is affected. This is because: \n \n the exocrine pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which break down food so they can be absorbed by your body \n the endocrine pancreas produces hormones \u2013 including insulin, which keeps your blood sugar levels stable \n \n Most cases\u00a0of pancreatic cancer are\u00a0in the exocrine pancreas, and the three most common symptoms are: \n \n pain in the stomach or\u00a0back \n jaundice \n weight loss \n \n It's important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different health conditions and aren't usually the result of cancer.\u00a0However, you should contact your GP if you're concerned, or if you\u00a0suddenly develop these symptoms. \n Pain in the stomach or\u00a0back \n Pancreatic cancer can cause a dull pain in your upper tummy (abdomen), which may\u00a0spread to your back. \n To begin with, the pain may come and go, but as the tumour becomes larger and more advanced, the pain may be more constant and last longer. \n The pain is often worse when you lie down or after you've eaten. You may also have pain or tenderness in your abdomen if your liver, pancreas or gallbladder are enlarged. \n Weight loss \n Many types of cancer cause weight loss, because the cancerous cells deprive your healthy cells of the nutrients they need. \n Pancreatic cancer is more likely to cause weight loss than some other cancers because the pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which help food to be absorbed into your body. \n If a tumour disrupts that production, your body will find it harder to digest food, particularly high-fat foods. \n This can cause you to lose weight and become  malnourished  \n Jaundice \n Jaundice is caused by a build-up of a yellowish-brown substance called bilirubin in the blood and tissues of the body. \n The most obvious sign of jaundice is yellow skin and yellowing of the whites of the eyes. It also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured. \n Bilirubin is a waste product produced by the liver, and passed out of the body through the bile duct and\u00a0into the intestine. \n Jaundice is more often a sign of conditions such as  gallstones \u00a0or  hepatitis \u00a0than it is of cancer. \n However, a tumour can sometimes develop in the head of the pancreas and block the bile duct, causing bilirubin to build up\u00a0in the body. \n Diabetes \n The pancreas produces the\u00a0hormone\u00a0insulin. Without it, the body can't move glucose (sugar) out of the blood and into your cells. \n The main symptoms of diabetes include: \n \n excessive thirst \n urinating frequently \u2013 particularly at night\u00a0 \n extreme tiredness\u00a0 \n weight loss and loss of muscle bulk \n \n You may develop  diabetes \u00a0if you have\u00a0pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin. \n Other possible symptoms \n Other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include: \n \n itching (if you have jaundice) \n nausea and vomiting \n bowel changes \n fever and shivering \n indigestion \n blood clots \n \n Endocrine pancreatic cancer \n Endocrine pancreatic tumours, also known as neuroendocrine tumours, are uncommon. \n There are a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces. \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about the  symptoms of endocrine pancreatic tumours .", "causes": "The exact cause of pancreatic cancer isn't fully understood. \n However, there are a number of risk factors\u00a0that can increase your chances of developing it. \n Age \n Pancreatic cancer can affect people of any age, but it\u00a0mainly affects people who are aged 50 to 80. Almost 50% of people diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas are aged 75 or over. \n Smoking \n Research has found that about one in three cases of pancreatic cancer is associated with\u00a0 smoking  and other tobacco use. \n Smoking cigarettes, cigars or chewing tobacco can all increase your risk of developing cancer of the pancreas. \n This is because tobacco smoke contains harmful chemicals and toxins that can cause irritation and inflammation\u00a0within your body's organs and\u00a0tissues. \n Diabetes \n If you have\u00a0 diabetes , your risk of developing pancreatic cancer is thought to be\u00a0increased. \n However, it's important to remember that diabetes is very common, affecting more than\u00a03 million people in the UK, and most people with diabetes won't develop pancreatic cancer. \n As well as diabetes being a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, it's also thought that a cancerous tumour that grows in the pancreas could be responsible for some cases of diabetes. \n Chronic pancreatitis and hereditary pancreatitis \n  Chronic\u00a0pancreatitis \u00a0(long-term inflammation of the pancreas) increases your risk of getting pancreatic cancer, but\u00a0isn't responsible for many cases. Chronic pancreatitis is often caused by long-term  alcohol misuse .\u00a0 \n Although it's a very\u00a0rare condition, if you have hereditary pancreatitis, your\u00a0risk of developing pancreatic cancer is 50 times greater than the rest of the population. \n Helicobacter pylori infection \n Helicobacter pylori are bacteria that cause stomach ulcers, and is a known risk factor for stomach cancer. \n Research has shown that a Helicobacter pylori infection may slightly\u00a0increase your risk of getting pancreatic cancer. However, the risk is thought to be small because most people with\u00a0this infection don't get cancer of the pancreas. \n Other known risk factors \n There are also a number of other factors that have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. These are: \n \n long-term  hepatitis  \n tooth or  gum disease  \n  heavy alcohol use  \n a previous history of certain types of  cancer  \n previously having  radiotherapy  \n  diet ,\u00a0 weight  and level of  physical activity  \n \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has\u00a0more information about these  other possible risk factors for pancreatic cancer .", "treatment": "Treatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the type, location and stage of your cancer (how far it's spread). \n Your age, general health and personal preferences will also be taken into consideration when deciding on your treatment plan. \n The first aim will be to completely remove the tumour and any other cancerous cells in your body. \n If this isn't possible, the focus will be on preventing the tumour growing and causing further harm. \n Sometimes it's not\u00a0possible to get rid of the cancer or slow it down,\u00a0so treatment will aim to relieve your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible. \n Cancer of the pancreas is very difficult to treat. In its early stages, this type of cancer rarely causes symptoms, so it's often not detected until it's quite advanced. If the tumour is large or has spread, treating or curing the cancer is much harder. \n Cancer Research UK has more information about  stages of pancreatic cancer  \n Discussing your treatment \n Deciding what treatment is best for you can be a difficult process. There's a lot to take in, so it's important to talk about the possible alternatives with a family member or friend. \n You should also have an in-depth\u00a0discussion with your doctor, who can tell you the pros and\u00a0cons of the treatments available to you. \n If at any stage you don't understand the treatment options being explained to you, make sure you ask your doctor for more details. \n There are three main ways that cancer of the pancreas can be treated: \n \n  surgery  \n  chemotherapy  \n  radiotherapy  \n \n Some types of pancreatic cancer only require one form of treatment, whereas others may require two or a combination of all three. \n Cancer Research UK\u00a0has more information about  types of treatment for pancreatic cancer . \n Surgery \n Surgery is usually the only way\u00a0pancreatic cancer can be completely cured. However, as the condition is usually advanced by the time it's diagnosed, surgery is only suitable for around 15-20% of people. \n However, this isn't a suitable option\u00a0if your tumour has wrapped itself around important blood vessels. If your cancer has spread to other areas of the body, surgically removing the tumour won't cure you. \n Surgery for pancreatic cancer is usually only an option for people who have a good general level of\u00a0health. This is because pancreas surgery is often long and complex, and the recovery process can be slow. \n Sometimes\u00a0the risks of surgery\u00a0can outweigh the potential benefits. \n Your doctor will discuss with you whether surgery is a suitable option. There are several possible surgical procedures, which are\u00a0outlined below. \n Whipple procedure \n The Whipple procedure is the most common operation used to treat pancreatic cancer, and involves removing the head of the pancreas. \n Your surgeon must also remove the first part of your small intestine (bowel), your gall bladder (which stores\u00a0bile)\u00a0and part of your bile duct. Sometimes, part of the stomach also has to be removed. \n The end of the bile duct and the remaining part of your pancreas is connected to your small intestine. This\u00a0allows bile and the hormones and enzymes produced by the pancreas to still be released into\u00a0your system. \n After this type of surgery, about one in three people need to take enzymes to help them digest food. \n The Whipple procedure involves long and intensive surgery, but it's easier to recover from than a total pancreatectomy (see below). \n Distal pancreatectomy \n A distal pancreatectomy involves\u00a0removing the tail and body of your pancreas. \n Your spleen will usually also be removed at the same time. Part of your stomach, bowel, left adrenal gland, left kidney and left diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen) may also be removed. \n Like the Whipple procedure, a distal pancreatectomy is a long and complex operation\u00a0that won't be carried out\u00a0unless your doctor thinks it's necessary. \n Total pancreatectomy \n During a total pancreatectomy, your entire pancreas will be removed. This is sometimes necessary due to the position of the tumour. \n Your surgeon will also remove your: \n \n bile duct \n gall bladder \n spleen \n part of your small intestine \n part of your stomach (sometimes) \n surrounding lymph nodes (part of the immune system) \n \n After a total pancreatectomy, you'll need to take enzymes to help your digestive system digest food. You'll also have\u00a0 diabetes \u00a0for the rest of your life because the pancreas produces insulin\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the hormone that regulates blood sugar. \n Removing your spleen can increase your risk of developing infections and may also affect your blood's ability to clot. This means you'll be on penicillin (or an alternative antibiotic if you're allergic to it) for the rest of your life, and you'll need to have regular vaccinations. \n Sometimes, you may need to take tablets for a short period to stop the platelets in your blood sticking to each other. Platelets are a type of blood\u00a0cell\u00a0that cause your blood to clot (thicken). \n Surgery to ease your symptoms \n Although surgery may not be a suitable way of removing your tumour, you may be offered\u00a0it to help ease your symptoms. \n This type of surgery won't cure your cancer, but will mean that your condition is easier to manage, and it will make you more comfortable. \n To help control jaundice, a stent can be placed in your bile duct using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This will help keep the bile duct open and prevent bilirubin\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the yellow chemical in bile\u00a0\u2013\u00a0from building up and causing jaundice. \n If a stent isn't a suitable option for you, you may need an operation to bypass your blocked bile duct. Your surgeon will cut the bile duct just above the blockage and reconnect it to your intestine, which allows your bile to drain away. \n These types of surgery are much less intensive than surgery carried out on the pancreas. The recovery time is much quicker, and\u00a0people find that their\u00a0jaundice improves significantly. \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy\u00a0is a type of cancer treatment that uses anti-cancer medicines to either kill the cancerous (malignant) cells in your body or stop them\u00a0multiplying. \n Chemotherapy treatment is often used alongside surgery and radiotherapy (see below) to help ensure that as much of the cancer is treated as possible. \n Chemotherapy may be given: \n \n before surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to try to shrink the cancer, so there's a greater chance of the surgeon being able to remove all of the cancer \n after surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back \n when surgery isn't possible\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to try to shrink the cancer, slow its growth and relieve your symptoms \n \n Some chemotherapy medicines can be taken orally (by mouth), but some need to be given directly into a vein (intravenously). \n Chemotherapy also attacks\u00a0normal, healthy cells, which is why this type of treatment can have many side effects. The most common side effects include: \n \n vomiting \n nausea \n mouth sores \n fatigue \n increased risk of infection\u00a0 \n \n These are usually only temporary, and should improve once you've completed your treatment. \n The chemotherapy medications can also be used in combination, so your doctor may suggest using one medication or a combination of two or three. \n Combining chemotherapy medications can give a better chance of shrinking or controlling the cancer, but increases the chance of side effects.\u00a0Sometimes, the risks of chemotherapy can outweigh the potential benefits. \n Read more about  chemotherapy  \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy\u00a0is a form of cancer therapy that uses high-energy beams of\u00a0 radiation  to help shrink your tumour and relieve pain. \n Side effects of radiotherapy\u00a0can include: \n \n fatigue \n skin rashes \n loss of appetite \n diarrhoea \n nausea or vomiting\u00a0 \n \n These side effects are usually only temporary, and should improve after your treatment has been completed. \n Read more about  radiotherapy", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "In the early stages, pancreatic cancer often causes no symptoms. This can make it difficult to diagnose. \n If you visit your GP with  symptoms of pancreatic cancer ,\u00a0they will probably examine your eyes and skin for signs of jaundice. \n They may also test your urine for bile, or carry out a  blood test . This is because jaundice can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer. \n Your GP may also examine your tummy (abdomen) to feel for any swelling or abnormality. The pancreas is quite well-hidden within the body because it's covered by part of the bowel. This can make it difficult to feel for tumours during a physical examination. \n If\u00a0your GP suspects pancreatic cancer, you'll be referred for further testing at a hospital. Some of the tests you may need are outlined below. \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected pancreatic cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n Ultrasound scan \n An\u00a0 ultrasound scan \u00a0is a painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your body. \n If\u00a0pancreatic cancer is suspected, you'll be referred for an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to see if your pancreas appears abnormal. \n However, this type of scan can often miss pancreatic cancer, because ultrasound waves aren't very good\u00a0at penetrating deep into body tissues.\u00a0 \n Computerised tomography (CT) scan \n A\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT)\u00a0scan  produces a detailed image of the inside of your body using a series of\u00a0 X-ray  images. \n Your doctor can use the results of a CT\u00a0scan to check for abnormalities and assess the size of the tumour. \n Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \n A\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  also produces an image of the inside of your body, but it uses strong magnetic and radio waves instead of X-rays. \n MRI scans are carried out in a tube-shaped\u00a0MRI scanner. It's a noisy procedure that\u00a0can feel claustrophobic. It also takes longer than other types of\u00a0scans. \n Like a CT scan, an MRI scan allows your doctor to check for signs of\u00a0 cancer  in other parts of the body. \n Positron emission tomography (PET) scan \n A positron emission tomography (PET) scan can help to show where the cancer is and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. \n Before the scan, you'll be given an injection of a very small amount of a radioactive medication, known as\u00a0a tracer. The amount of\u00a0radiation is very small and no more than you would receive from a normal X-ray.\u00a0 \n The most common tracer used is a radioactive form of glucose (sugar).\u00a0You'll then rest for about an hour to allow the tracer to travel to areas in your body where glucose is used for energy. \n The scan itself can take up to an hour and produces an image of the tracer in your body. The tracer shows up cancers because they use glucose in a different way to normal tissue. \n Endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) \n If a small shadow is seen on a CT or MRI scan but it's not obvious what it\u00a0is, another test called endoluminal ultrasonography (EUS) can be carried out. \n During EUS, a thin, flexible\u00a0instrument called\u00a0an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. \n An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the endoscope will then be used to take close-up pictures of your pancreas. \n Before the procedure, you may be given a sedative to help you relax. EUS can also be used to take a  biopsy  (see below) for further examination. \n Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) \n Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure used to insert a plastic tube or stent into the bile duct if\u00a0someone has\u00a0jaundice. \n During ERCP, an endoscope is passed through your mouth and guided towards your stomach. The endoscope can then be used to inject a special dye into your bile and pancreatic ducts. \n After the dye has been injected, an X-ray will be taken. The dye will show up on the X-ray and will highlight any tumour that's blocking the bile and pancreatic ducts. \n During the procedure, tissue samples may be taken. These samples can be looked at under a microscope to see whether the cells are cancerous. \n ERCP can take 30-60 minutes. As with EUS, you'll usually be given a sedative to help you relax. \n Laparoscopy \n A\u00a0laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to access the inside of your abdomen and pelvis. \n During the procedure, a small\u00a0incision will be made in your abdomen, and a laparoscope (a thin,\u00a0flexible microscope) will be inserted. \n This will allow the surgeon to see inside your body and make sure the tumour hasn't spread before recommending its removal. \n This procedure will be carried out\u00a0under a\u00a0 general anaesthetic  (where you're put to sleep so you don't feel any pain or discomfort). \n Biopsy \n A\u00a0 biopsy \u00a0involves taking a sample from a suspected tumour, which\u00a0can then be tested to see if it's cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). \n A biopsy can be carried out during an EUS, ERCP or laparoscopy using\u00a0a small instrument attached to the endoscope to collect a number of cells. \n It's also possible for a\u00a0biopsy to be carried out using a long, thin needle that's passed through your abdomen. The needle will be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound or CT scan."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Overactive thyroid", "introduction": "Overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body. \n Excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body\u2019s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as: \n \n nervousness and  anxiety  \n hyperactivity \u2013 where a person can\u2019t stay still and is full of nervous energy \n unexplained or unplanned weight loss\u00a0 \n swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a  goitre , to form in the throat \n \n The severity, frequency and range of symptoms can vary from person to person. \n Read more about the  symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland  \n What causes an overactive thyroid gland? \n The thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine. \n They affect processes such as heart rate and body temperature, and help convert food into energy to keep the body going. \n In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine, which speeds up the body's metabolism. \n There are several possible underlying causes, the most common being Graves' disease, in which the body's immune system targets the thyroid gland and causes it to produce too much of the thyroid hormones. \n Read more about the  causes of an overactive thyroid gland  \n Treatment \n An overactive thyroid\u00a0usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms. \n The three most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are: \n \n thionamides \u2013 a group of medications, including\u00a0carbimazole and methimazole,\u00a0that stop the thyroid gland producing too much thyroid hormone \n radioiodine treatment \u2013\u00a0a radioactive substance called iodine that helps shrink the thyroid gland, reducing its activity (the radiation contained in iodine is a very low dose and does not pose a threat to health) \n surgery \u2013\u00a0in a small number of cases surgery may be required to remove some or all of the\u00a0thyroid gland, particularly if there is a large goitre \n \n Beta-blockers may also\u00a0sometimes be used\u00a0to temporarily relieve many symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland, although it doesn't target the thyroid gland itself. \n It's common for treatment to lead to the thyroid not producing enough hormones. This is known as having an\u00a0 underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) .\u00a0However, an\u00a0underactive thyroid is not\u00a0usually serious and\u00a0is easily treated. \n Read more about the  treatment of an overactive thyroid gland  \n Complications \n Around 1 in 20 people with Graves' disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as: \n \n double vision \n sensitivity to light (photophobia) \n tearing (excess production of tears) \n \n This is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist). \n A rarer and more serious complication is a\u00a0sudden and severe flare-up of symptoms, known as a thyroid storm. A thyroid storm\u00a0can be\u00a0life-threatening, as it causes severe\u00a0 dehydration \u00a0and heart problems. \n Read more about the  complications of an overactive thyroid gland  \n Who is affected \n Women are 10 times more likely to have an overactive thyroid gland than men. \n It is estimated that around 1 in 50 women in England currently live with an overactive thyroid gland. \n In most cases, symptoms will begin somewhere between the ages of 20 and 40, though they can start at any age, including in childhood. \n An overactive thyroid gland occurs most frequently in white and Asian people, and less frequently in\u00a0African-Caribbean\u00a0people.", "symptoms": "An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) has many signs and symptoms, although it is unlikely you would develop all of them. \n Symptoms of hyperthyroidism \n If you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms: \n \n hyperactivity \n mood swings \u2013 such as  anxiety , irritability and nervousness \n  difficulty sleeping (insomnia)  \n feeling tired all the time (fatique) \n muscle weakness \n needing to pass stools (faeces) or urine more\u00a0frequently \n excess fats in your stools \u2013 which can make them greasy and difficult to flush down the toilet (steatorrhoea) \n sensitivity to heat and\u00a0 excess sweating  \n unexplained or unexpected weight loss \u2013 despite having an increased appetite (though in a small number of cases, the increase in appetite can lead to weight gain) \n very infrequent or light periods, or periods stopping altogether \n  infertility  \n    loss of interest in sex \u00a0 \n \n If you have  diabetes , your diabetic symptoms, such as extreme thirst and tiredness, may be made worse by hyperthyroidism. \n Signs of hyperthyroidism \n If you have hyperthyroidism, you may have some of the following physical signs: \n \n a swelling in your neck caused by an  enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)  \n irregular and/or\u00a0unusually fast heart rate ( palpitations ) \n trembling or shaking (tremor) \n warm, moist skin \n redness on the palms of your hands \n loosening of your nails in their nail beds \n  hives (urticaria)  \n patchy hair loss (alopecia) \n twitching in your face and limbs \n \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you are experiencing any of the above. They may not be the result of an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation. \n It might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis.", "causes": "Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the thyroid hormones thyroxine or triiodothyronine. \n Overproduction of thyroid hormones can be caused by a number of conditions, which are outlined below. \n Graves' disease \n Graves' disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid. It can run in families and can occur at any age, although it is most common in women aged 20-40 years old. You are more likely to develop Graves' disease if you smoke. \n Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition.\u00a0This means the immune system mistakes\u00a0something\u00a0in the body for a toxic substance and attacks it. \n In\u00a0Graves' disease,\u00a0it attacks the\u00a0thyroid gland, which\u00a0leads to an overproduction of the thyroid hormones. \n It is not known what triggers the immune system to do this. Like many autoimmune conditions, it is thought that a combination of both genetic and environmental factors could be involved. \n If you have Graves' disease, your eyes may also be affected, causing discomfort and double vision. This is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy. You may find\u00a0your eyes bulge out or appear more prominent. \n For more information on Graves' ophthalmopathy, read our page on\u00a0complications of an overactive thyroid gland. \n Thyroid nodules \n It is possible for lumps to develop in your thyroid gland. These are known as nodules. It is not known why nodules develop, but they are usually non-cancerous (benign). \n However, the nodules can contain abnormal thyroid tissue, which affects the normal production of thyroxine or triiodothyronine, causing an overactive thyroid. Nodules that contain abnormal thyroid tissue are described as toxic. \n Toxic thyroid nodules account for about\u00a01 in 20 cases of hyperthyroidism. \n Iodine supplements \n Iodine contained in the food you eat is used by your thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. However, taking additional iodine in supplements can cause your thyroid gland to produce too much thyroxine or triiodothyronine. \n This is known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism \u2013 sometimes referred to as Jod-Basedow phenomenon. It usually only occurs if you already have nodules in your thyroid gland. \n Amiodarone \n Amiodarone is a type of medication known as an anti-arrhythmic, which helps to control an  irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) . If you have non-toxic nodules in your thyroid gland, taking amiodarone can cause hyperthyroidism because it contains iodine.\u00a0 \n Amiodarone can cause a type of hyperthyroidism usually more severe and difficult to treat through a harmful effect on thyroid tissue. This type of hyperthyroidism is called amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. \n Follicular thyroid cancer \n In rare cases, you may develop an overactive thyroid as a result of\u00a0 thyroid cancer  that starts in your thyroid follicles. This can occur if cancer cells in your thyroid gland begin to produce thyroxine or triiodothyronine. This is also known as functioning thyroid cancer.", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you think you may have an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). \n A diagnosis will be based on your symptoms and the results of\u00a0 blood tests  that assess how well your thyroid gland is working. These are known as thyroid function tests. \n Thyroid function tests \n Your GP will take a sample of your blood and test it for levels of: \n \n thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) \n thyroxine and triiodothyronine (the thyroid hormones) \n \n TSH is made in the pituitary gland in your brain and controls the production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. \n \n When the level of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in your blood are normal, your pituitary gland releases a normal level of TSH. When thyroid hormone production becomes excessive, the pituitary gland stops releasing TSH.\u00a0\u00a0 \n When the level of thyroxine or triiodothyronine drops, the pituitary gland produces more TSH to boost it. \n \n If you have an overactive thyroid, the thyroid function test will show that levels of TSH in your blood are consistently lower than normal. Low levels of TSH mean your thyroid gland is overactive and\u00a0likely to be making\u00a0excessive thyroid hormones. This is the first part of the thyroid function test. \n Your GP will then test your blood for levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine. If you have an overactive thyroid, you will have higher than normal levels of both these hormones. \n Subclinical overactive thyroid gland \n In some cases, tests may show you have\u00a0normal thyroid hormone levels, but low or suppressed levels of TSH. \n This is known a subclinical overactive thyroid gland. If you are diagnosed with subclinical overactive thyroid, you may not need treatment. \n In most cases, the reduced level of TSH in your blood returns to normal within a couple of months and your subclinical hyperthyroidism will resolve by itself. \n However, you will need a further thyroid function test so your condition can be monitored. \n Determining the underlying cause \n If tests confirm an overactive thyroid gland, you may be referred for further tests to determine the underlying cause. \n An additional test that may be used is an isotope thyroid scan. This involves swallowing small amounts of a radioactive substance (an isotope), usually technetium, in capsule or liquid form. \n A scan is then used to measure how much of the isotope has been absorbed by your thyroid gland. \n If your thyroid gland absorbs a high amount of the isotope, it is likely\u00a0the underlying cause is either Graves' disease or thyroid nodules. \n If the amount is low, the underlying cause could be due to: \n \n swelling (inflammation) of the thyroid gland ( thyroiditis ), often caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking thyroid tissue or, less commonly, by infection \n having too much iodine in your diet \n in rare cases,\u00a0 thyroid cancer"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ovarian cancer", "introduction": "In the UK, around 7,100 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year. \n It's the fifth most common cancer among women after  breast cancer ,  bowel cancer ,\u00a0 lung cancer  and  cancer of the uterus (womb) . \n Ovarian cancer is most common in women who have\u00a0been through\u00a0the\u00a0 menopause \u00a0(usually over the age of 50), although it can affect women of any age. \n As the\u00a0 symptoms of ovarian cancer  can be similar to those of other conditions, it can be difficult to recognise. However, there are early symptoms to look out for, such as\u00a0persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, and difficulty eating. \n It's important to see your GP if you experience these symptoms, particularly over a\u00a0long period of time. Read more about  how ovarian cancer is diagnosed . \n The ovaries are a pair of small organs in the female reproductive system that contain and release an egg once a month. This is known as ovulation. \n  Different types of ovarian cancer  affect different parts of the ovaries. Epithelial ovarian cancer, which affects the surface layers of the ovary, is the most common type. This topic focuses\u00a0on epithelial ovarian cancer. \n What causes ovarian cancer? \n The exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman's risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past.\u00a0However, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link. \n Read more about the  causes of ovarian cancer  \n Treating ovarian cancer\u00a0 \n The treatment you receive for ovarian cancer will depend on several things, including the stage of your\u00a0cancer and your general health.  Chemotherapy  is the main treatment for ovarian cancer, but your treatment will usually involve a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. \n Read more about  how ovarian cancer is treated  \n Overall, 72 out of every 100 women (72%) will live for at least one year after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Around 46 out of 100 (46%) women will live for at least five years, and about 35 out of 100 (35%) will live for at least 10 years. However, women with advanced ovarian cancer have a poorer survival rate. \n As with most types of cancer, the outlook for ovarian cancer will depend on the stage it's at when diagnosed \u2013 that is, how far the cancer has advanced. The  Cancer\u00a0Research UK  website has more information\u00a0about the  outlook for ovarian cancer . \n Being diagnosed with\u00a0ovarian cancer can affect daily life in many ways. However, support is available for many aspects of\u00a0 living with\u00a0ovarian cancer , including emotional, financial and long-term health issues. \n Ovarian cancer screening \n There are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven't been fully tested. Screening\u00a0is only available for women who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene.\u00a0Clinical trials in the UK are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk women and in the general population. A  cervical screening test , which used to be called a smear test, can't detect ovarian cancer. \n Read more about  preventing ovarian cancer", "symptoms": "The symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages. \n This is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). \n However, three main symptoms are more frequent in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. They are: \n \n increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes) \n persistent pelvic and abdominal pain \n difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous \n \n Other symptoms, such as back pain,\u00a0needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. However, they may be present in some women with ovarian cancer. \n If you have these types of symptoms, try keeping a diary to record how many of these symptoms you have over a longer period. Bear in mind\u00a0that ovarian cancer is rare in women under 40 years of age. \n See your GP if you have these symptoms regularly (on most days for three weeks or more). Although it's unlikely they're being caused by a serious problem, it's best to check. \n If you've already seen your GP and the symptoms continue or get worse, you should go back and explain this. You know your body better than anyone. \n Want to know more? \n \n Target Ovarian Cancer:\u00a0 ovarian cancer symptoms", "causes": "Several possible causes of ovarian cancer have been identified, along with risks that may make developing the condition more likely. \n Cancer begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. \n In ovarian cancer, cells in the ovary start to change and grow abnormally. If the cancer isn't identified at an early stage, it can spread to the abdomen and pelvis, including other parts of the female reproductive system. \n Increased risk \n The exact cause of epithelial ovarian cancer (the main type) isn't known, but certain things may increase your risk of developing it. \n Age \n Your risk of ovarian cancer increases with age, with most cases occurring after the  menopause . More than 8 out of 10 cases of ovarian cancer occur in women who are over 50 years of age. \n Family history \n If you have two or more close relatives (mother, sister or daughter) who developed ovarian cancer or  breast cancer , your risk of also developing the condition may be increased. \n If your relatives developed cancer before the age of 50, it's more likely it was the result of an inherited faulty gene. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are faulty genes that are linked to ovarian cancer. They're also known to increase the risk of breast cancer. \n Having relatives with ovarian cancer doesn't mean you definitely have a faulty gene in the family \u2013 the cancer could have happened by chance. Only\u00a01 in 10 (10%) of ovarian cancers are thought to be caused by a faulty gene. \n You may be at a high risk of having a faulty gene if you have: \n \n one relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least two close relatives with breast cancer whose average age is under 60; all of these relatives should be on the same side of your family (either your mother's OR father's side) \n one relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age and at least one close relative diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50; both of these relatives should come from the same side of your family \n two relatives from the same side of the family diagnosed with ovarian cancer at any age\u00a0 \n \n If you're at a higher risk of having a faulty gene, your GP can refer you for tests to check for faulty BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. \n Ovulation and fertility \n Every time an egg is released into the reproductive system, the surface of the ovary breaks to let it out. The surface of the ovary is damaged during this process and needs to be repaired. Each time this happens, there's a greater chance of abnormal cell growth during the repair.\u00a0 \n This may be why the risk of ovarian cancer decreases if you take the  contraceptive pill , or have multiple pregnancies or periods of breastfeeding. At these times, eggs aren't released. \n There's no strong evidence to show that women who have infertility treatment have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, it's thought that\u00a0 infertility  itself may increase ovarian cancer\u00a0risk and research into this area is being carried out.\u00a0 \n Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \n Women who take\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have been shown to have a small increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, if HRT is stopped, after five years the risk is reduced to the same level as women who've never taken HRT. \n Endometriosis \n  Endometriosis  may also increase your risk of ovarian cancer. In endometriosis, the cells that usually line the womb grow elsewhere in the body. \n These endometrial cells behave as if they were in the womb, so thickening and bleeding that usually occurs during menstruation occurs in other parts of the body. There's no way for this endometrial tissue to leave the body so it becomes trapped, leading to pain, swelling and bleeding in that area. \n More information\u00a0 \n \n Cancer Research UK:  Ovarian cancer risks and causes", "treatment": "Surgery \n Most women with ovarian cancer will\u00a0be considered for\u00a0surgery. It sometimes isn't possible to confirm the stage of the cancer until surgery is carried out. \n Your doctor will discuss what will happen during surgery. It will probably involve removing: \n \n both ovaries and the fallopian tubes (a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) \n the womb\u00a0(a total abdominal hysterectomy) \n the omentum \u2013 a fatty layer of tissue within the abdomen (an omentectomy) \n \n The surgeon may also remove the lymph nodes from your pelvis and abdomen, and samples of nearby tissue, to find out whether the cancer has spread. \n If it has spread, the surgeon will try to remove as much of it as possible. This is known as \"debulking surgery\". \n If the cancer is confined to one or both ovaries, you may only need to have the ovary or ovaries removed, leaving your womb intact. This means you may still be able to carry a pregnancy. \n You will probably be ready to go home\u00a0three to seven\u00a0days after your operation, but it can take many weeks to fully recover. \n When you go home, you'll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness.\u00a0 Walking  and  swimming  are good exercises that are suitable for most people after treatment for ovarian cancer. Discuss the types of exercise that are suitable for you\u00a0with your doctor or physiotherapist. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Cancer Research UK: surgery for ovarian cancer  \n  Macmillan: surgery for ovarian cancer  \n \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill cancer cells. It's often given after surgery for ovarian cancer. In some cases, it can be given before surgery to help shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. This is called \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\". \n Several different medicines can be used in chemotherapy. A combination is often given. The choice of medicine and how and when it's given depends on the\u00a0stage of your cancer and how much it has spread. The most common treatment for ovarian cancer is a platinum-containing medicine (carboplatin), which is used alone or in combination with another medicine called paclitaxel. \n Chemotherapy is usually given as\u00a0a drip\u00a0into the vein, but is sometimes given as tablets. Some studies have looked at giving chemotherapy directly into the abdomen \u2013 called \"intraperitoneal chemotherapy\". It is not currently established routine practice in the UK, but it's being assessed in clinical trials. \n You will usually have chemotherapy as an outpatient, but you may sometimes need a short stay in hospital. It's usually given in cycles, with a period of treatment followed by a period of rest, to allow the body to recover. Most women have six cycles of chemotherapy. \n Is chemotherapy working? \n Over the course of your chemotherapy, you'll have tests to monitor how the cancer is responding to treatment. This can be done in a number of ways. For example: \n \n if you had higher than normal levels of the\u00a0 protein CA125  in your blood when diagnosed, you may have  blood tests  to see whether the levels are falling \n if you had a tumour visible on a\u00a0 CT scan  or  ultrasound scan  when\u00a0diagnosed, you may have repeated scans to see whether it has shrunk \n you may have another small operation, known as \"second-look surgery\", which is carried out in the same way as a laparoscopy \n \n After your chemotherapy treatment, if all of your tests are clear of cancer, you'll be in remission. This means the cancer is under control. \n Side effects of chemotherapy \n Side effects\u00a0of chemotherapy\u00a0include: \n \n infections \n loss of appetite \n nausea and vomiting \n tiredness \n  hair loss \u00a0 \n sore mouth \n \n Many side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines your doctor can prescribe. \n Chemotherapy for recurring cancer \n Ovarian cancer can come back (relapse) after treatment. If this happens, you may have another course of chemotherapy. This is called \"second-line treatment\". \n Want to know more? \n \n  Cancer Research UK: chemotherapy for ovarian cancer  \n  Macmillan: chemotherapy for ovarian cancer  \n  Target Ovarian Cancer: when cancer comes back  \n \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy\u00a0uses high energy  X-rays . Like chemotherapy, it works by targeting rapidly growing cancer cells. \n Radiotherapy isn't usually used to treat ovarian cancer. However, the multidisciplinary team may occasionally recommend\u00a0it to treat\u00a0ovarian cancer under very specific circumstances, such as treating pain and bleeding from a localised tumour mass. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Cancer Research UK: radiotherapy for ovarian cancer  \n  Macmillan: radiotherapy for ovarian cancer  \n \n Clinical trials \n In recent years,\u00a0much progress has been made in ovarian cancer treatment. More women are living longer and experiencing fewer side effects. These advances were discovered through\u00a0clinical trials,\u00a0where new medicines and combinations of medicines are compared with standard treatment. \n All cancer trials in the UK are subject to careful monitoring,\u00a0to ensure the trial is worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials can\u00a0often do better overall than in routine care. \n If you're asked about taking part in a trial, you'll be offered an information sheet. If you wish to take part, you'll be asked to give your\u00a0 consent (permission)  by signing a form. You're always free to refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Cancer Research: ovarian cancer research . \n \n Psychological help \n Dealing with cancer can be a huge challenge for patients and their families. It can bring emotional and practical difficulties. \n It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness. There are various ways to find help and support. For example: \n \n your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor;\u00a0talk to your GP if\u00a0you're feeling depressed;\u00a0a course of\u00a0 antidepressants  may help, or your GP can arrange for you to see a counsellor or psychotherapist \n it can help to talk to someone who's been through the same thing as you; many organisations have helplines and online forums; they can also put you in touch with other people who have had cancer treatment \n \n Want to know more? \n \n  Macmillan Cancer Support  \n  Target Ovarian Cancer: sources of support for women with ovarian cancer", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP as soon as possible if you have any  symptoms of ovarian cancer . \n Your GP will gently feel your tummy (abdomen) and ask you about your symptoms, general health and whether there's a history of ovarian or\u00a0 breast cancer  in your family. \n They may carry out an internal examination and may take a blood sample or refer you for an\u00a0 ultrasound scan . \n If needed, you may also be referred to a specialist (a gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist) at a hospital. \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected ovarian cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n Blood test (CA125) \n You may have a blood test to look for a protein called CA125 in your blood. CA125 is produced by some ovarian cancer cells.\u00a0A very high level of CA125 may indicate that you have ovarian cancer. \n However, CA125 isn't specific to ovarian cancer and it can be raised in conditions including  endometriosis ,\u00a0 fibroids , pelvic inflammatory disease\u00a0and pregnancy, so\u00a0a raised CA125 level doesn't definitely mean you have ovarian cancer. \n The Lab Tests Online UK website has more information\u00a0on the  CA125 test . \n The\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced\u00a0guidance that recommends testing for CA125 if you frequently experience:\u00a0 \n \n bloating \n feeling full quickly and/or loss of appetite\u00a0 \n pelvic or abdominal pain\u00a0 \n needing to urinate urgently and/or frequently\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Read the full\u00a0 NICE guidance about the recognition and initial management of ovarian cancer (PDF, 179kb) . \n If you experience unexplained weight loss, fatigue or changes in your bowel habits, such as\u00a0 diarrhoea  or  constipation , you may also be tested for CA125. \n If you're 50 or over and you've experienced symptoms that could suggest\u00a0 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  in the last 12 months, such as bloating, abdominal pain or changes in your bowel habits, your GP should test your CA125 level. \n Around half\u00a0of all women with early stage ovarian cancer\u00a0have a raised level of CA125 in their blood. If your CA125 level is raised,\u00a0you'll be referred for an ultrasound scan. \n Ultrasound scan \n An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your ovaries. You may have an internal ultrasound where the ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina, or you may have an external ultrasound, where the probe is put next to your stomach. \n The image produced can show the size and texture of your ovaries, plus any cysts or other swellings that are present. \n Further tests \n If you've been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, you may have further tests to see how large the cancer is and\u00a0if it's spread. This is called staging. \n Other tests you may have include: \n \n a chest  X-ray  \n a  CT scan  or  MRI scan  \n abdominal fluid aspiration \u2013 a thin needle\u00a0is passed into your abdomen, so that a fluid sample can be taken and tested for cancerous cells\u00a0 \n laparoscopy \u2013 a thin tube with a camera on the end\u00a0is\u00a0inserted through a small incision in your lower abdomen, so that your ovaries can be examined; a small tissue sample may also be taken from your ovaries for testing (a  biopsy ) \n \n Staging helps your doctors to decide on the best kind of treatment for your condition. However, it's important to remember that the stage of your ovarian cancer alone cannot predict how your condition will progress. \n The\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information\u00a0on  further tests for ovarian cancer . \n Stages and grades of ovarian cancer \n Staging \n If your test results indicate that you have ovarian cancer,\u00a0it will be given a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. The four commonly used stages of ovarian cancer are: \n \n stage 1 \u2013 where the cancer only affects one or both of the ovaries \n stage 2 \u2013 where the cancer has spread from the ovary and into the pelvis or\u00a0womb \n stage 3 \u2013 where the cancer has spread to the lining of the abdomen, the surface of the bowel and the lymph nodes in the pelvis \n stage 4 \u2013 where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the\u00a0liver, spleen or lungs\u00a0 \n \n This is a simplified guide. Each stage is further divided into categories A, B and C.\u00a0Ask your doctor if you're not sure what stage you have. \n Grading \n The grade of cancer refers to the appearance of\u00a0cells under a microscope. The grades are as follows: \n \n low grade \u2013 although abnormal, cells appear to be slow-growing \n moderate grade \u2013 cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells \n high grade \u2013 cells look very abnormal and are likely to be fast-growing \n \n The\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information\u00a0on the  stages and grading of ovarian cancer ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Panic disorder", "introduction": "Panic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason. \n Everyone experiences feelings of\u00a0anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It's a natural response to stressful or\u00a0dangerous situations. \n However, for someone with panic disorder, feelings of anxiety, stress and panic occur regularly and at any time. \n Anxiety \n Anxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including \n \n  phobias \u00a0\u2013 an extreme or irrational fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal \n generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) \u2013 a long-term condition that causes excessive anxiety and worry relating to a variety of situations \n post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 a condition with psychological and physical symptoms caused by distressing or frightening events \n \n Panic attacks \n A panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms. \n You may experience an overwhelming sense of fear, apprehension and anxiety. As well as these feelings, you may also have physical symptoms such as: \n \n nausea \n sweating \n trembling \n a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations) \n \n The number of panic attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is. Some people may have one or two attacks each month, while others may have several attacks a week. \n Read more about the  symptoms of panic disorder . \n Panic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they're not dangerous. An attack won't cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely that you'll be admitted to hospital if you've had a panic attack. \n What causes panic disorder? \n As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood. \n However, it's thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors. \n Read about the possible  causes of panic disorder . \n It\u2019s important to be aware that some physical conditions and disorders can have similar symptoms to those of anxiety. For example: \n \n mitral valve prolapse \n postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS) \n  anaemia  \n paroxysmal atrial tachycardia \u2013 episodes of rapid and regular heartbeats that begin and end abruptly \n thyrotoxicosis \u2013 where large amounts of thyroid hormones are released into the bloodstream, causing rapid heartbeat,  sweating , tremor and anxiety \n poorly controlled  diabetes  \n adrenal tumours \u2013 growths that develop on the adrenal glands (two triangular-shaped glands that form part of the kidneys) \n carcinoid syndrome \u2013 a set of symptoms caused by some carcinoid tumours that can develop in the cells of the endocrine system (glands that produce and secrete hormones) \n Zollinger-Ellison syndrome \u2013 causes overproduction of insulin and low blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) \n \n Diagnosing panic disorder \n See your GP if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above). \n You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks. \n Read more about  how panic disorder is diagnosed . \n Treating panic disorder \n The aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms. \n Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder. \n Read more about  treating panic disorder  and  things you can do to help yourself during a panic attack . \n Having panic disorder may affect your ability to drive. It's your legal obligation to inform the  Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)  about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. \n GOV.UK has further information and advice about  driving with a disability or health condition . \n Complications of panic disorder \n Panic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it's important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it's given at an early stage. \n Left untreated, panic disorder can become a very debilitating and isolating illness. It can also increase your risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other  phobias . \n Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things go wrong. \n Read more about the  complications of panic disorder .", "symptoms": "The symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing. \n Symptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason. \n As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other\u00a0symptoms, including: \n \n a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly ( palpitations ) \n sweating \n trembling \n hot flushes \n chills \n  shortness of breath \u00a0 \n a choking sensation \n chest pain \n nausea \n dizziness \n feeling\u00a0faint \n numbness or\u00a0pins and needles \n dry mouth \n a need to go to the toilet \n ringing in your ears\u00a0 \n a feeling of dread or a fear of dying \n a churning stomach \n a tingling sensation in your fingers \n shivering \n shaking \n \n The physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror. \n For this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which\u00a0creates a\u00a0cycle of living in \u2018fear of fear\u2019 and adds to the sense of panic. \n Sometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you're having a  heart attack . \n However, it's important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won't result in you having a heart attack. Although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don't cause any physical harm. People who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this 'heart attack sensation' and\u00a0become more aware of how to control their symptoms. \n Most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes.\u00a0Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it's likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack. \n Recurrent panic attacks \n People with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week. \n People with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable. \n If you have panic disorder, you may also\u00a0feel\u00a0anxious about when your next attack will be. \n Depersonalisation \n During a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can\u00a0feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. It can almost feel as if you're an observer, making the situation seem very unreal. \n This sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn't provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating.", "causes": "As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood. \n It's thought that panic disorder is probably caused by a combination of physical and psychological factors. Some of these factors are outlined below. \n Traumatic life experiences \n A trauma, such as  bereavement , can sometimes trigger feelings of panic and anxiety. These feelings may be obvious soon after the event or they may be triggered unexpectedly years later. \n Genetics \n Having a close family member with panic disorder is thought to increase a person's risk of developing it. However, the precise nature of the risk isn't known. \n Neurotransmitters \n Neurotransmitters are chemicals that occur naturally in the brain. It's thought that an imbalance of these chemicals may increase your risk of developing conditions such as panic disorder. \n Increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide \n Some experts believe that panic disorder is linked to an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide. Breathing in air with high carbon dioxide levels can bring on panic attacks, and breathing techniques can help to relieve or stop panic attacks. \n Catastrophic thinking \n Another theory is that people who experience panic attacks tend to focus on\u00a0minor physical symptoms and interpret them in a catastrophic way. This triggers a nervous system response that causes the panic attack.", "treatment": "The main aim in treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks and ease the severity of symptoms. \n Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder. \n Depending on your individual circumstances, you may need one of these treatment types or a combination of the two. \n If you're offered psychological therapy, it will probably be in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). If this doesn't work, medication may be recommended. \n Before starting any form of treatment, your GP will discuss all of the options with you, outlining the advantages of each type and making you aware of any possible risks or side effects. \n No single treatment works for everyone and you may need to try a number of treatments before finding one that works for you. The treatment that's recommended will depend on your general level of health, the severity of your condition and your personal preferences. \n It's important you understand what your treatment will involve. If you don't understand something your GP has told you, ask them to explain it in more detail. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy \n Psychological therapy has proven long-term benefits and it's recommended for treating panic disorder. It will usually take the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \n CBT is thought to be one of the most effective psychological treatments for panic disorder. It involves having regular sessions with a therapist. \n The therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about when you're experiencing an attack. \n Once you and your therapist have identified any negative thoughts and beliefs, you can work on replacing them with more realistic and balanced ones. Your therapist can also teach you ways of changing your behaviour, making it easier for you to deal with future panic attacks. \n For example, they may be able to show you breathing techniques that can be used to help keep you calm during a panic attack. \n The\u00a0 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of CBT to be completed within a four month period. Treatment will usually involve having a weekly one to two hour session. \n NICE also recommends that in certain situations a shorter programme of CBT may be appropriate. This can involve a reduced number of hours of CBT with \u2018homework\u2019 being set between sessions so that you can practice what you've learnt after each session. \n You should visit your GP regularly\u00a0while you're having CBT so that they can assess your progress and see how you're doing. \n Support groups \n Support groups can provide useful information and advice about how you can effectively manage your panic disorder. They're also a good way of meeting other people who've had similar experiences of the condition. \n Panic attacks can sometimes be frightening and isolating, so it can be helpful to know that other people are experiencing the same feelings and emotions as you. \n  Anxiety UK  and  Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK)  are UK-based charities that provide information and support for people with anxiety disorders. \n Support groups often involve face-to-face meetings where you can talk about your problems and difficulties with others. Many can also provide support and guidance over the telephone or in writing. \n Ask your GP about support groups for panic disorder near you. You can also use the services directory to\u00a0 find anxiety services in your area . \n Antidepressants \n  Antidepressants \u00a0are often associated with  depression , but they can also be used to treat a number of other psychological conditions. \n Antidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective. It's therefore important to continue taking them, even if you feel they're\u00a0not working. You should only ever stop taking prescribed medication if your GP specifically advises you to do so. \n  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  and tricyclic antidepressants are two types of antidepressants that are often recommended for treating\u00a0panic disorder. \n When starting a new type of medication, you should be regularly assessed by your GP at two, four, six and 12 week intervals. This will allow you to discuss any issues that you have with your medication, and enables your GP to assess which treatment is most effective. It will also provide you with the opportunity to try a different type of medication if you want to. \n Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \n Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u00a0(SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. \n They're the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant for treating panic disorder. They're usually started at a low dose before gradually being increased as your body adjusts to the medicine. \n Common side effects of SSRIs include: \n \n nausea \n  headaches \u00a0 \n low sex drive\u00a0(loss of libido) \n blurred vision \n  diarrhoea \u00a0or\u00a0 constipation  \n dizziness \n dry mouth\u00a0 \n loss of appetite \n sweating \n feeling agitated \n  insomnia \u00a0(sleep problems) \n abdominal pain \n \n When you first start taking SSRIs, your feelings of\u00a0anxiety and panic may get slightly worse. In most cases, this is temporary and your symptoms will start to return to normal levels within a few days of taking the medicine. \n Speak to your GP if you feel that your symptoms have got worse and that they're not showing signs of returning to normal levels after a few days. \n After you start to take a SSRI, you should visit your GP after two, four, six, and 12 weeks so that they can check on your progress and see whether you're responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important that your progress is carefully monitored. \n If your GP feels it necessary, you may require regular\u00a0 blood tests  or blood pressure checks when taking antidepressants. If after 12 weeks of taking the medication you don't show any signs of improvement, your GP may prescribe an alternative SSRI to see if it has any effect. \n The length of time that you'll have to take a SSRI for will vary depending on how well you respond to the treatment. Even if you feel that your panic disorder has been successfully treated, it's likely that you'll need to keep taking the medication for at least six to 12 months. \n If you stop taking your medication before this time, the risk of your symptoms recurring may be increased. Some people may have to take SSRIs for longer than the usual six to 12 month period. \n When you and your GP decide that it's appropriate for you to stop taking SSRIs, you will gradually be weaned off them by slowly reducing your dosage. As with antidepressants, you should never stop taking SSRIs\u00a0unless your GP specifically advises you to. \n Stopping your medication straight away without being weaned off, or without seeking advice from your GP, may result in withdrawal symptoms such as: \n \n dizziness \n numbness and tingling \n nausea and vomiting \n headache \n anxiety \n sleep disturbances \n sweating \n \n These symptoms can also occur if you miss a dose of medication, or if your dose is reduced. The symptoms are usually mild, but they can be severe if the medication is stopped suddenly. \n For some people, this means having to take SSRIs on a long-term basis. For others, a course of CBT can help to reduce the risk of their symptoms recurring. \n Contact your GP if you experience troublesome side effects that\u00a0don't ease. \n Tricyclic antidepressants \n If SSRIs aren't suitable, or if your symptoms don't improve after a 12 week course of SSRIs, your GP may try prescribing a different type of antidepressant. \n Tricyclic antidepressants work in a similar way to SSRIs. They regulate the levels of the chemicals noradrenaline and serotonin in your brain, which has a positive effect on your feelings and mood. \n Imipramine\u00a0and\u00a0clomipramine are two tricyclic antidepressants that are often prescribed to treat panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants aren't addictive. \n SSRIs are usually prescribed before tricyclic antidepressants because they have fewer side effects. Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants include: \n \n constipation \n difficulty urinating \n blurred vision \n dry mouth \n weight gain or weight loss \n drowsiness \n sweating \n lightheadedness \n skin rash \n \n The side effects should ease after seven to 10\u00a0days as your body starts to get used to the medication. However, see your GP if they become troublesome and don't ease. \n Pregabalin \n Pregabalin is another medication that\u2019s often used to treat panic disorder. It\u2019s an anticonvulsant that's also used to treat\u00a0 epilepsy  (a condition that causes repeated seizures). However, it's also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety. \n Side effects of pregabalin can include: \n \n drowsiness \n dizziness \n increased appetite and weight gain \n blurred vision \n  headaches  \n dry mouth \n  vertigo  \u2013 the sensation that you, or the environment around you, are moving or spinning \n \n Pregabalin is less likely to cause nausea or a low sex drive than SSRIs. \n Clonazepam \n Clonazepam is another medication that\u2019s often used to treat epilepsy and is also sometimes prescribed for panic disorder. \n It can cause a wide variety of side effects including lethargy (lack of energy), abnormal eye movement (nystagmus), confusion and allergic reactions. \n Referral \n You may be referred to a mental health specialist if treatments such as attending a support group, CBT and medication don't improve your  symptoms of panic disorder . \n A mental health specialist will carry out an overall reassessment of your condition. They'll ask you about your previous treatment and how effective you found it. They may also ask you about things in your life that may be affecting your condition, or how much support you get from family and friends. \n The specialist will be able to devise a treatment plan for you, which will aim to effectively treat your symptoms. The type of mental health specialist that you'll be referred to will depend on your individual situation. For example, you may be referred to a: \n \n psychiatrist \u2013 a trained medical doctor who specialises in mental health; a psychiatrist is one of the only mental health specialists who is able to prescribe medication \n clinical psychologist \u2013 who is trained in the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes and focuses solely on the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions; a clinical psychologist will help you to find ways of effectively managing your anxiety and panic attacks", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Everyone who has panic disorder will experience panic attacks. \n However, not everyone who has\u00a0panic attacks is diagnosed with panic disorder. \n Panic attacks \n Some people have panic attacks in response to specific situations. For example, they may have a phobia (overwhelming fear) of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) and have a panic attack when faced with an enclosed space. \n While most people with\u00a0 phobias  only experience panic attacks when faced with the thing that\u00a0triggers their fear, the panic attacks of people with panic disorder usually occur without warning and for no obvious reason. \n This means that panic disorder will only be diagnosed after experiencing recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, and if the attacks are followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks. \n Talk to your GP \n Your GP will ask you to describe the symptoms you've been experiencing. They'll also ask you how often your symptoms occur and in what situations. \n It's important to tell your GP about how you've been feeling and how your symptoms have affected you. \n Although it can sometimes be difficult to talk to someone else about your feelings, emotions and personal life,\u00a0try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. \n Your GP needs to gain a good understanding of your symptoms to\u00a0make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment for you. \n Physical examination \n Your GP may also want to carry out a physical examination to look for signs of any physical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. \n For example, an\u00a0 overactive thyroid  gland (hyperthyroidism) can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a panic attack. \n By ruling out any underlying medical conditions, your GP will be able to make the correct diagnosis."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ovarian cancer: Teenagers and young adults", "introduction": "This section is for teenagers and young adults. It\u2019s about a type of cancer called ovarian cancer. \n We have more info for young people about: \n \n \n germ cell tumours of the ovary \u2013 causes and symptoms \n \n \n   having tests for ovarian cancer  \u00a0 \n \n \n   treating ovarian cancer   \n \n \n For more information about ovarian cancer in women of all ages, please see our general\u00a0  ovarian cancer   section. \n Ovarian cancer starts in the ovaries, which are part of the reproductive system. This is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). Your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby. \n Your reproductive system \n Your reproductive system is made up of: \n \n \n the vagina - the passage from the cervix to outside your body \n \n \n the cervix - the opening from the womb to the vagina \n \n \n the womb (also called uterus) - where a baby grows during pregnancy \n \n \n the fallopian tubes - which connect your ovaries to the womb \n \n \n the ovaries - which store all your eggs and release one every month after puberty. \n \n \n Facts about ovaries \n You have two ovaries - one on each side of your womb. They\u2019re about 4cm long. \n At puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. These cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start. \n Every month after puberty, your ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes to the womb. The womb\u2019s lining gets thicker, ready for an egg to be fertilised by a man\u2019s sperm. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the womb\u2019s lining comes out of your vagina as blood - this is a period. \n When a woman is about 50 her periods stop, because her ovaries have run out of eggs so they stop making hormones. This is called the menopause. \n Types of ovarian cancer\u00a0 \n There are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours. \n Teenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. You may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called: \n \n \n dysgerminoma \n \n \n teratoma \n \n \n yolk sac tumour \n \n \n Germ cell tumours of the ovary are rare. They start in the egg-producing cells of the ovary. Treatment will usually cure germ cell tumours. \n Your specialist will explain more about the type of germ cell tumour that you have. If you have a type of ovarian cancer or germ cell tumour that's not listed here, you can talk to one of\u00a0Macmillan's   cancer support specialists   to find out more.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Osteosarcoma", "introduction": "Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer. About 30 children in the UK develop osteosarcomas each year. These tumours occur more commonly in older children and teenagers and are very rarely seen in children under five. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments. But it remains devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it\u2019s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Osteosarcoma \n Osteosarcoma often starts at the end of the long bones, where new bone tissue forms as a young person grows. Any bone in the body can be affected, but the most common sites are in the arms and legs, particularly around the knee and shoulder joints. \n There are several different types of osteosarcoma. Most occur in the centre of the bone. There are also rare subtypes, such as parosteal, periosteal, telangiectatic, and small cell osteosarcoma. \n Causes \n There has been a lot of research into the causes of osteosarcoma but, like most childhood cancers, a definite cause is unknown. There are a few risk factors that have been associated with osteosarcoma. Children who have hereditary  retinoblastoma  (a rare tumour of the eye) have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Children who have previously had radiotherapy and chemotherapy also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. It is not caused by injuries or damage to the bone, although an injury may draw attention to a bone tumour. \n Signs and symptoms \n Pain in the affected bone is the most common symptom. This pain may initially come and go, and then gradually become more severe and constant especially at night. There may also be swelling around the affected bone. Osteosarcoma is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the person has had a minor fall or accident. Some patients may develop a limp if the tumour is in the leg or pelvis. \n These symptoms can be caused by many things other than cancer. However, any persistent bone pain should be checked by your child\u2019s doctor. Symptoms are often attributed to a sporting injury. \n How osteosarcoma is diagnosed \n Usually you begin by seeing your family doctor (GP), who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. Many of the specific tests for diagnosing bone tumours require experience and specialist techniques so if a bone tumour is suspected, the doctor will refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre for further tests. \n The doctor at the hospital will take your child\u2019s full medical history. They will then do a physical examination. This will include an examination of the painful bone to check for any swelling or tenderness. Your child will probably have a blood test to check their general health. \n A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose an osteosarcoma. An X-ray of the painful part of the bone will usually identify a tumour, although sometimes they can be difficult to see. \n A small piece of the tumour will be removed and looked at under a microscope. This is called a biopsy. It\u2019s a small operation, performed under a general anaesthetic. \n Other tests are done to check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. These include a chest  X-ray ,  blood tests , a bone scan and an  MRI  or  CT scan . \n Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. \n Grading \n Grading refers to the appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope, and gives an idea of how quickly the cancer may develop. Low-grade cancer cells are usually slow-growing and less likely to spread. \n In high-grade tumours the cells are likely to grow quickly and are more likely to spread. \n Most osteosarcomas are high-grade, but a type known as parosteal osteosarcoma is usually low-grade. \n Staging \n The \u2018stage\u2019 of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment. \n Most patients are grouped depending on whether cancer is found in only one part of the body (localised disease), or whether the cancer has spread from one part of the body to another (metastatic disease). \n A staging system commonly used for osteosarcomas is described below: \n  Stage 1A  \n The cancer is low-grade and is only found within the hard coating of the bone. \n  Stage 1B  \n The cancer is low-grade, extending outside the bone and into the soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. \n  Stage 2A  \n The cancer is high-grade and is completely contained within the hard coating of the bone. \n  Stage 2B  \n The cancer is high-grade and has spread outside the bone and into surrounding soft tissue spaces that contain nerves and blood vessels. Most osteosarcomas are stage 2B. \n  Stage 3  \n The cancer can be low or high-grade and is either found within the bone or extends outside the bone. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or to other bones not directly connected to the bone where the tumour started. \n If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer. \n Treatment \n Treatment will depend on a number of factors including the size, position, and stage of the tumour. \n  Chemotherapy  \n  Chemotherapy  is a very important part of treatment for osteosarcoma. Chemotherapy uses anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells, and is usually given to shrink the main tumour before surgery. It\u2019s also given after the tumour has been removed by surgery, to help reduce the risk of the cancer coming back (recurring). It\u2019s common for a combination of drugs to be used. \n  Radiotherapy  \n  Radiotherapy  may occasionally be given. This treats cancer by using high energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. \n  Surgery  \n The type and extent of surgery depends on the position and size of the tumour in the body. This surgery will need to be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic centre, and your child should be referred to one. \n Surgery may include removing the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone, which is then replaced by some form of false limb (prosthesis). If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. Most children will be considered for limb-sparing surgery. \n  Amputation  \n Sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer is affecting the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. \n After amputation, a false limb will be fitted and will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs can work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sports. \n  Limb-sparing surgery  \n There are two ways that limb-sparing surgery may be done: \n \n replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part) \n replacing the affected bone with bone taken from another part of the body (bone graft) \n \n After this type of surgery, children will usually be able to use their limbs almost normally. However, they are advised not to participate in any contact sports. This is because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. \n If your child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened as the bone grows. This may mean there are extra short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened as an outpatient procedure. \n  New treatments for osteosarcoma  \n Mifamurtide, also called Mepact\u00ae, is a new type of biological therapy treatment. It may be offered to your child if they have had a surgical resection to remove the osteosarcoma and the tumour has not spread. It will be given along with chemotherapy after surgery to try and stop the osteosarcoma coming back. Mifamurtide is a relatively new drug and so more research needs to be done to fully understand its side effects and how to use it best. \n Side effects of treatment \n Treatment often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend upon the treatment being given and the part of the body that\u2019s being treated. \n  Chemotherapy side effects  \n Some general side effects of chemotherapy can include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n  hair loss  \n increased risk of infection bruising and bleeding tiredness \n  diarrhoea  \n \n  Radiotherapy side effects  \n Radiotherapy can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. \n  Surgery side effects  \n If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having. \n Late side effects \n A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. \n Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you and monitor your child for any potential late effects. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial, if there is a suitable one open. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancer. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. Your child\u2019s doctor can tell you if there are any trials available that might be suitable for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Many children with osteosarcoma are cured. However, your child may need to have surgery to lengthen the affected limb as they grow. Your child will have regular check-ups and X-rays in the paediatric or adolescent oncology clinic, and at the orthopaedic centre. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it is best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ovarian cyst", "introduction": "An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman\u2019s ovary. They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms. \n Most ovarian cysts occur as part of the normal workings of the ovaries. These cysts are generally harmless and disappear without treatment in a few months. \n Signs and symptoms \n An ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries. In these cases, you may have: \n \n pelvic pain \u2013 this can range from a dull, heavy sensation to a sudden, severe and sharp pain \n pain during sex \n difficulty emptying your bowels \n a frequent need to urinate \n  heavy periods , irregular periods or lighter periods than normal \n bloating and a swollen tummy \n feeling very full after only eating a little \n difficulty getting pregnant (although fertility is unaffected in most women with ovarian cysts\u00a0\u2013 see below) \n \n Visit your GP if you have persistent symptoms of an ovarian cyst. \n Immediately contact your GP, local out-of-hours service or  NHS 111 service  \u2013 or go to  your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department  \u2013 if you have sudden, severe pelvic pain. \n The ovaries \n The ovaries are two small, bean-shaped organs that are part of the female reproductive system. A woman has two ovaries\u00a0\u2013 one each side of the womb (uterus). \n The ovaries have two main functions. They are: \n \n to release an egg approximately every 28 days as part of the menstrual cylce \n to release the female sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, which play an important role in female reproduction \n \n Ovarian cysts may affect both ovaries at the same time, or they may only affect one. \n Types of ovarian cyst \n The two main types of ovarian are: \n \n functional ovarian cysts \u2013 cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type of ovarian cyst \n pathological ovarian cysts \u2013 cysts that occur\u00a0due to\u00a0abnormal cell growth; these are much less common \n \n Ovarian cysts can sometimes also be caused by an underlying condition, such as  endometriosis . \n The vast majority of ovarian cysts are non-cancerous (benign), although a small number are cancerous (malignant). Cancerous cysts are more common in women who have been through the menopause. \n Read more about the  causes of ovarian cysts  \n Diagnosing ovarian cysts \n If your GP thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you'll probably be referred for an\u00a0 ultrasound scan , carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina. \n If a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks, or your GP may refer you to a gynaecologist (a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health). \n If there is any concern that\u00a0your cyst could be cancerous, your doctor will also arrange\u00a0 blood tests  to look for high levels of chemicals that can indicate  ovarian cancer . \n However, having high levels of these chemicals doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer, as high levels can also be caused by non-cancerous conditions such as\u00a0 endometriosis , a pelvic infection, fibroids or even being on your period. \n How ovarian cysts are treated \n Whether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on: \n \n its size and appearance \n whether you have any symptoms \n whether you have\u00a0been through\u00a0the menopause \n \n In most cases, the cyst often disappears after a few months. A follow-up ultrasound scan may be used to confirm this. \n Due to the slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer\u00a0in post-menopausal women, regular ultrasound scans and blood tests are usually recommended over the course of a year to monitor the cyst. \n Large cysts, those causing symptoms, and those that could be cancerous, may need to be surgically removed. \n Read more about  treating ovarian cysts", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Ovarian cysts often develop for no apparent reason in women who have monthly periods. \n They can also affect women who no longer have periods, because they have been through the  menopause . \n Types of ovarian cyst \n There are a many different types of ovarian cyst, which can be categorised as either \"functional cysts\" or \"pathological cysts\". \n Functional cysts \n Functional ovarian cysts form\u00a0due to\u00a0a minor problem in the menstrual cycle. They affect girls and women who have not been through the menopause, and are very common. \n Each month, a woman's ovaries release an egg, which travels down the fallopian tubes into the womb (uterus), where it can be fertilised by a man's sperm. \n Each egg forms inside the ovary in a structure known as a follicle. The follicle contains fluid that protects the egg as it grows and it bursts when the egg is released. \n However, sometimes a follicle does not release an egg, or discharge its fluid and shrink after the egg is released. If this happens, the follicle can swell and become a cyst. \n Functional cysts can also develop when the tissue left behind after an egg has been released (corpus luteum) fills with fluid. \n Functional cysts are\u00a0non-cancerous (benign) and are usually harmless, although they can sometimes cause symptoms such as pelvic pain. Most will disappear without treatment in a few months. \n Pathological cysts \n Pathological cysts\u00a0are cysts caused\u00a0by abnormal cell growth and aren't related to the menstrual cycle. They\u00a0can\u00a0develop before\u00a0and after the menopause. \n Pathological cysts develop from\u00a0either the cells used to create eggs or the\u00a0cells that cover the outer part of the ovary. \n They can sometimes burst\u00a0or grow very large and\u00a0block the blood supply to the ovaries. \n Pathological cysts\u00a0are usually non-cancerous, but a small number are cancerous (malignant) and they are often surgically removed. \n Conditions that\u00a0cause ovarian cysts \n In some cases, ovarian cysts are caused by certain conditions, such as  endometriosis . \n Endometriosis occurs when pieces of the tissue that line the womb (endometrium) are found outside the womb in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder, bowel, vagina or rectum. Blood-filled cysts can sometimes form in this tissue. \n  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) \u00a0is a condition that causes lots of small, harmless cysts to develop on your ovaries. The cysts are small egg follicles that do not grow to ovulation and are the result of altered hormone levels.", "treatment": "In most cases, ovarian cysts disappear in a few months without the need for treatment. \n Whether treatment is needed will depend on: \n \n its size and\u00a0appearance \n whether you have any symptoms \n whether you have had the\u00a0 menopause  (post-menopausal women have a slightly higher risk of  ovarian cancer ) \n \n Watchful waiting \n In most cases, a policy of \"watchful waiting\" is\u00a0recommended. \n This means you won't\u00a0receive immediate treatment, but you may have an  ultrasound scan \u00a0a few weeks or months later to check if the cyst has gone. \n Due to\u00a0the slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer in post-menopausal women, women who have been through the menopause may be advised to have ultrasound scans and\u00a0 blood tests  every four months for a year. \n If the scans show that the cyst has disappeared, further tests and treatment are not usually necessary. If the cyst is still there, surgery may be recommended. \n Surgery \n Large or persistent ovarian cysts, or cysts that are causing symptoms, will usually need to be surgically removed. \n Surgery will also normally be recommended if there are concerns that the cyst could be cancerous or could\u00a0become cancerous. \n There are two types of surgery used to remove ovarian cysts: \n \n a\u00a0laparoscopy \n a laparotomy \n \n These\u00a0are usually carried out under  general anaesthetic . \n Laparoscopy \n Most cysts can be removed using laparoscopy. This is a type of keyhole surgery where small cuts are made in your tummy and gas is blown into the pelvis to allow the surgeon to access your ovaries. \n A laparoscope (a small, tube-shaped microscope with a light on the end) is\u00a0passed into your abdomen so the surgeon can see your internal organs. The surgeon\u00a0then removes the cyst through the small\u00a0cuts in your skin. \n After the cyst has been removed, the cuts will be closed using dissolvable stitches. \n A laparoscopy is preferred because it causes less pain and has a quicker recovery time.\u00a0Most women are able to go home on the same day or the following day. \n Laparotomy \n If your cyst is particularly large, or there is a chance it could be cancerous, a laparotomy may be recommended. \n During a laparotomy, a single, larger\u00a0cut\u00a0is\u00a0made in your tummy to give the surgeon better access to the cyst. \n The whole cyst and ovary may be removed and sent to a laboratory to check whether it's cancerous.\u00a0Stitches or staples will be used to close the incision. \n You may need to stay in hospital for a few days after the procedure. \n After surgery \n After the ovarian cyst has been removed, you will feel pain in your tummy, although this\u00a0should improve\u00a0in a day\u00a0or two. \n Following laparoscopic surgery, you will probably need to take things easy for two weeks. Recovery after a laparotomy will usually take longer, possibly around six to eight weeks. \n If the cyst is sent off for testing, the results\u00a0should come back in a few weeks and\u00a0your consultant will discuss with you whether you need\u00a0any further treatment. \n Contact your GP if you notice the following symptoms during your recovery: \n \n heavy bleeding \n severe pain or swelling in your abdomen \n a high temperature (fever) \n dark or smelly vaginal discharge \n \n These symptoms may indicate an infection. \n Your fertility \n If you have not been through the menopause, your surgeon\u00a0will try to preserve as much of your reproductive system as they can. It's often possible to\u00a0just remove the cyst and leave both ovaries intact, which means your fertility should be largely unaffected. \n If one of your ovaries needs to be removed, the remaining ovary will\u00a0still release hormones and eggs as usual. Your fertility shouldn't be significantly affected, although you may find it slightly\u00a0harder to get pregnant. \n Occasionally, it may be\u00a0necessary to remove both ovaries in women who have not been through the menopause. This\u00a0will trigger an early menopause and mean you no longer produce any eggs. \n However, it may still be possible to have a baby by having a donated egg implanted into your womb. This will need to be discussed with specialists at a centre that specialises in assisted reproduction techniques. \n In women who have been through the menopause, both ovaries may be removed because they no longer produce eggs. \n Make sure you discuss your fertility\u00a0concerns with your surgeon before your operation. \n Cancer\u00a0treatment \n If\u00a0your test\u00a0results show\u00a0that\u00a0your cyst is cancerous, both of your ovaries, your womb (uterus) and some of the surrounding tissue may need to be removed. \n Again, this would trigger an early menopause and mean that you would no longer be able to get pregnant. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating ovarian cancer", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Osteoarthritis", "introduction": "Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes the joints to become painful and stiff. It is the most common type of arthritis in the UK. \n The severity of osteoarthritis symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and between different affected joints. For some people, the symptoms may be mild and may come and go, whereas others can experience more continuous and severe problems. \n Almost any joint can be affected by osteoarthritis, but the condition most often causes problems in the knees, hips, and small joints of the hands. \n The pain and stiffness in the joints can make carrying out everyday activities difficult for some people with the condition. \n Read more about the  symptoms of osteoarthritis . \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can try to identify the cause. \n To help determine whether you have osteoarthritis, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your joints. \n Read more about  diagnosing osteoarthritis . \n What causes osteoarthritis? \n Osteoarthritis occurs when there is damage in and around the joints that the body cannot fully repair. \n It's not clear exactly why this happens in some people, although your chances of developing the condition can be influenced by a number of factors, such as your age and weight. \n Osteoarthritis usually develops in people over 45 years of age, although younger people can also be affected. \n It is commonly thought that osteoarthritis is an inevitable part of getting older, but this is not quite true. You may in fact be able to reduce your chances of developing the condition by doing regular, gentle exercises and maintaining a healthy weight. \n Read more about the  causes of osteoarthritis  and  preventing osteoarthritis . \n Managing osteoarthritis \n Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition and can't be cured, but it doesn't necessarily get any worse over time and it can sometimes gradually improve. A number of treatments are also available to reduce the symptoms. \n Mild symptoms can sometimes be managed with simple measures including regular exercise, losing weight if you are overweight, wearing suitable footwear and using special devices to reduce the strain on your joints during your everyday activities. \n If your symptoms are more severe, you may need additional treatments such as painkilling medication and a structured exercise plan carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist. \n In a small number of cases, where the above treatments haven't helped or the damage to the joints is particularly severe, surgery may be carried out to repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint. \n Read more about  treating osteoarthritis . \n Living with osteoarthritis \n As osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, it is important you get the right support to help you cope with any issues such as reduced mobility and advice on any necessary financial support. \n As well as support from your healthcare team, it is important to look after your own health and wellbeing. This includes taking your medicine regularly and adopting as healthy a lifestyle as possible. \n Some people may also find it helpful to talk to their GP or others who are living with the same condition as there may be questions or worries you want to share. \n Read more about  living with osteoarthritis .", "symptoms": "The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are pain and stiffness in your joints, which can make it difficult to move the affected joints and do certain activities. \n The symptoms may come and go in episodes, which can be related to things such as your activity levels and even the weather. In more severe cases, the symptoms can be continuous. \n Other symptoms you or your doctor may notice include: \n \n joint tenderness \n increased pain and stiffness when you have not moved your joints for a while \n joints appearing slightly larger or more 'knobbly' than usual \n a grating or crackling sound or sensation in your joints \n limited range of movement in your joints \n weakness and muscle wasting (loss of muscle bulk) \n \n Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body, but the most common areas affected are the knees, hips, and small joints in the hands. Often, you will only experience symptoms in one joint or a few joints at any one time. \n Osteoarthritis of the knee \n If you have osteoarthritis in your knees, it is likely both your knees will be affected over time, unless it has occurred as the result of an injury or another condition affecting only one knee. \n Your knees may be most painful when you walk, particularly when walking up or down hills or stairs. \n Sometimes, your knees may 'give way' beneath you or make it difficult to straighten your legs. You may also hear a soft, grating sound when you move the affected joint. \n Osteoarthritis of the hip \n Osteoarthritis in your hips often causes difficulty moving your hip joints. For example, you may find it difficult to put your shoes and socks on or to get in and out of a car. \n You will also usually have pain in the groin or outside the hip. This will often be worse when you move the hip joints, although it can also affect you when you are resting or sleeping. \n Osteoarthritis of the hand \n Osteoarthritis often affects three main areas of your hand: the base of your thumb, the joints closest to your fingertips and the middle joints of your fingers. \n Your fingers may become stiff, painful and swollen and you may develop bumps on your finger joints. But over time the pain may decrease and eventually disappear altogether, although the bumps and swelling can remain. \n Your fingers may bend sideways slightly at your affected joints or you may develop painful cysts (fluid-filled lumps) on the backs of your fingers. \n In some cases, you may also develop a bump at the base of your thumb where it joins your wrist. This can be painful and you may find it difficult to perform some manual tasks, such as writing, opening jars or turning keys. \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can try to identify the cause. \n To help determine whether you have osteoarthritis, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your joints. \n Read more about  diagnosing osteoarthritis .", "causes": "Osteoarthritis occurs when there is damage in and around the joints that the body can't fully repair. The exact causes are not known but there are several factors thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. \n As part of normal life, your joints are exposed to a constant low level of damage. In most cases, your body will repair the damage itself. Usually, the repair process will pass unnoticed and you will not experience any symptoms. \n However, in cases of osteoarthritis, the damage to the joints is not fully repaired and instead some of the cartilage (the protective surface that allows your joints to move smoothly) in the joint can be lost, bony growths can develop, and the area can become slightly inflamed (red and swollen). \n These changes are what cause the typical symptoms of pain, stiffness and swelling. \n Contributory factors \n It is not known why problems develop in the repair process in cases of osteoarthritis, although, several factors are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: \n \n Joint injury \u2013 Osteoarthritis can develop in a joint damaged by an injury or operation. Overusing your joint when it has not had enough time to heal after an injury or operation can also contribute to osteoarthritis in later life. \n Other conditions (secondary arthritis) \u2013 Sometimes, osteoarthritis can occur in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition, such as  rheumatoid arthritis  or  gout . It is possible for secondary osteoarthritis to develop many years after the initial damage to your joint. \n Age \u2013 Osteoarthritis is not a normal part of ageing, but your risk of developing the condition does increase as you get older. Most cases affect adults who are 45 years of age or older. \n Family history \u2013 In some cases, osteoarthritis may run in families. Genetic studies have not identified a single gene responsible, so it seems likely that many genes make small contributions. \n  Obesity  \u2013 Research into the causes of osteoarthritis has shown that being obese puts excess strain on your joints, particularly those that bear most of your weight, such as your knees and hips. As a result, osteoarthritis can often be worse in obese people. \n \n Although it is not possible to prevent osteoarthritis altogether, making some lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of joint injury and maintain a healthy weight may lower your chances of developing the condition. \n Read more about  preventing osteoarthritis .", "treatment": "Exercise is one of the most important treatments for people with osteoarthritis, whatever your age or level of fitness. Your physical activity should include a combination of exercises to strengthen your muscles and exercises to improve your general fitness. \n If osteoarthritis causes you pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. \n But usually, regular exercise that keeps you active and mobile and builds up muscle, thereby strengthening the joints, will improve symptoms. \n Exercise is also good for losing weight, improving your posture and relieving stress, all of which will ease symptoms. \n Your GP, or possibly a physiotherapist, will discuss the benefits you can expect from your exercise programme and can give you an exercise plan to follow at home. \n It's important to follow this plan because there is a risk that doing too much exercise too quickly, or doing the wrong sort of exercise, may damage your joints. \n Read more about  keeping active . \n Losing weight \n Being overweight or obese often makes osteoarthritis worse as it can place some of your joints under increased strain. \n If you are overweight, try to lose weight by doing more physical activity and eating a healthier diet. \n Discuss any new exercise plan with your GP or physiotherapist before you start. They can help plan a suitable exercise programme for you. Your GP and practice nurse can also advise about how to lose weight slowly and safely. \n Read more information and tips on  losing weight . \n Medication \n Your doctor will talk to you about medicines which can control symptoms of osteoarthritis, including painkillers. \n Sometimes a combination of therapies \u2013 medicines, exercise, assistive devices or surgery \u2013 may be needed to help control your pain. \n Painkillers \n The type of painkiller (analgesic) your GP may recommend for you will depend on the severity of your pain and other conditions or health problems you have. The main medications used are described below. \n Paracetamol \n If you have pain caused by osteoarthritis, your GP may suggest taking  paracetamol  to begin with. This is available over the counter in pharmacies without a prescription. It is best to take it regularly rather than waiting until your pain becomes unbearable. \n However, when taking paracetamol, always follow the dosage your GP recommends and do not exceed the maximum dose stated on the pack. \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n If paracetamol does not effectively control the pain of your osteoarthritis, your GP may prescribe a stronger painkiller. This may be a  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) . \n NSAIDs are painkillers that work by reducing inflammation. There are two types of NSAID and they work in slightly different ways: \n \n traditional NSAIDs \u2013 such as  ibuprofen , naproxen or diclofenac \n COX-2 inhibitors \u2013 often called coxibs \u2013 such as celecoxib and etoricoxib \n \n Some NSAIDs are available as creams (topical NSAIDs) that you apply directly to the affected joints. Some topical NSAIDs are available without a prescription. They can be particularly effective if you have osteoarthritis in your knees or hands. As well as helping to ease pain, they can also help reduce any swelling in your joints. \n Your doctor will discuss with you the type of NSAID you should take and the benefits and risks associated with it. \n NSAID tablets may not be suitable for people with certain conditions, such as  asthma , a  peptic ulcer  or  angina , or if you have had a  heart attack  or  stroke . If you are taking low-dose\u00a0 aspirin , ask your GP whether you should use an NSAID. \n If your GP recommends or prescribes an NSAID to be taken by mouth, they will usually also prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to take at the same time. NSAIDs can break down the lining in your stomach that protects it against stomach acid. PPIs reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach, reducing the risk of damage to your stomach lining. \n COX-2 drugs have a lower risk of causing stomach problems, but still need to be used with a PPI if you take them regularly. \n Opioids \n Opioids, such as codeine, are another type of painkiller that may ease your pain if paracetamol does not work. Opioids can help relieve severe pain, but can also cause side effects such as drowsiness, nausea and  constipation . \n Codeine is found in combination with paracetamol in common preparations such as co-codamol. \n Other opioids that may be prescribed for osteoarthritis include tramadol (brand names include Zamadol and Zydol), and dihydrocodeine (brand name DF 118 Forte). Both come in tablet form and as an injection. \n Tramadol is not suitable if you have uncontrolled  epilepsy , and dihydrocodeine is not recommended for patients with  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . \n If you need to take an opioid regularly, your GP may prescribe a  laxative  to take alongside it to prevent constipation. \n Capsaicin cream \n If you have osteoarthritis in your hands or knees and topical NSAIDs have not been effective in easing your pain, your GP may prescribe capsaicin cream. \n Capsaicin cream works by blocking the nerves that send pain messages in the treated area. You may have to use it for a while before it has an effect. You should experience some pain relief within the first two weeks of using the cream, but it may take up to a month for the treatment to be fully effective. \n Apply a pea-sized amount of capsaicin cream to your affected joints up to four times a day, but not more often than every four hours. Do not use capsaicin cream on broken or inflamed skin and always wash your hands after applying it. \n Be careful not to get any capsaicin cream on delicate areas, such as your eyes, mouth, nose and genitals. Capsaicin is made from chillies, so if you get it on sensitive areas of your body, it is likely to be very painful for a few hours. However, it will not cause any damage. \n You may notice a burning sensation on your skin after applying capsaicin cream. This is nothing to worry about, and the more you use it, the less it should happen. But avoid using too much cream or having a hot bath or shower before or after applying it, because it can make the burning sensation worse. \n Corticosteroid injections \n If your osteoarthritis is severe, treatment using painkillers may not be enough to control your pain. \n In this case, you may be able to have a type of treatment where medicine is injected into the joints affected by osteoarthritis. This is known as intra-articular injection. \n If you need intra-articular injections, it is likely that you will have injections of  corticosteroid , a medicine that reduces swelling and pain. \n If you get a prolonged response to the injection, it may be repeated. Ideally, you should have no more than three corticosteroid injections a year, with at least a three-month gap between injections. \n Supportive treatments \n In addition to lifestyle changes and medication, you may also benefit from a number of supportive treatments that can help reduce your pain and make everyday tasks easier. \n Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \n Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)\u00a0uses a machine that sends electrical impulses through sticky patches, called electrodes, attached to the skin. This may help ease the pain caused by your osteoarthritis by numbing the nerve endings in your spinal cord which control pain. \n Treatment with TENS is usually arranged by a physiotherapist, who can advise on the strength of the pulses and how long your treatment should last. \n Hot or cold packs \n Applying hot or cold packs (sometimes called thermotherapy or cryotherapy) to the joints can relieve the pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis in some people. A hot-water bottle filled with either hot or cold water and applied to the affected area can be very effective in reducing pain. \n Special hot and cold packs that can either be cooled in the freezer or heated in a microwave are also available, and work in a similar way. \n Manual therapy \n Not using your joints can cause your muscles to waste and may increase stiffness caused by osteoarthritis. Manual therapy is a treatment provided by a physiotherapist. It uses stretching techniques to keep your joints supple and flexible. \n Assistive devices \n If your osteoarthritis causes mobility problems or difficulty performing everyday tasks, several devices could help. Your GP may refer you to a physiotherapist or an occupational therapist for specialist help and advice. \n If you have osteoarthritis in your lower limbs, such as your hips, knees or feet, your physiotherapist or occupational therapist may suggest special footwear or insoles for your shoes. Footwear with shock-absorbing soles can help relieve some of the pressure on the joints of your legs as you walk. Special insoles may help spread your weight more evenly. Leg braces and supports also work in the same way. \n If you have osteoarthritis in your hip or knee that affects your mobility, you may need to use a walking aid, such as a stick or cane. Hold it on the opposite side of your body to your affected leg so that it takes some of your weight. \n A splint (a piece of rigid material used to provide support to a joint or bone) can also be useful if you need to rest a painful joint. Your physiotherapist can provide you with a splint and give you advice on how to use it correctly. \n If your hands are affected by osteoarthritis, you may also need assistance with hand-operated tasks, such as turning on a tap. Special devices, such as tap turners, can make performing these tasks far more manageable. Your occupational therapist can give you help and advice about using assistive devices in your home or workplace. \n Surgery \n Surgery for osteoarthritis is only needed in a small number of cases where other treatments have not been effective or where one of your joints is severely damaged. \n If you may need surgery for osteoarthritis, your GP will refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. Having surgery for osteoarthritis may greatly improve your symptoms, mobility and quality of life. However, surgery cannot be guaranteed to get rid of your symptoms altogether, and you may still experience pain and stiffness due to your condition. \n There are several different types of surgery for osteoarthritis. Some of the main types of surgery carried out are described below. \n Arthroplasty \n Joint replacement therapy, also known as an arthroplasty, is most commonly carried out to replace hip and knee joints. \n During an arthroplasty, your surgeon will remove your affected joint and replace it with an artificial joint (prosthesis) made of special plastics and metal. An artificial joint can last for up to 20 years, although it may eventually need to be replaced. \n There is also a newer type of joint replacement surgery called resurfacing. This uses only metal components and may be more suitable for younger patients. Your surgeon will discuss with you the type of surgery that would be best. \n Read more about  hip replacement  and  knee replacement . \n Arthrodesis \n If joint replacement is not suitable for you, your surgeon may suggest an operation known as an arthrodesis, which fuses your joint in a permanent position. This means that your joint will be stronger and much less painful, although you will no longer be able to move it. \n Osteotomy \n If you have osteoarthritis in your knees but you are not suitable for knee replacement surgery, you may be able to have an operation called an osteotomy. This involves your surgeon adding or removing a small section of bone either above or below your knee joint. \n This helps realign your knee so your weight is no longer focused on the damaged part of your knee. An osteotomy can relieve your symptoms of osteoarthritis, although you may still need knee replacement surgery eventually. \n Complementary and alternative therapies \n Some people with osteoarthritis try complementary or alternative therapies \u2013 such as acupuncture and aromatherapy \u2013 and find them helpful, although there is often a lack of medical evidence to suggest they are effective and they generally aren\u2019t recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). \n Nutritional supplements \n A number of nutritional supplements have also been used to treat osteoarthritis in the past, including chondroitin and glucosamine. \n Glucosamine hydrochloride has not been shown to have any beneficial effects, but there is evidence that glucosamine sulphate and chondroitin sulphate may help symptoms to a small degree and do not cause many side effects. However, these supplements can be expensive and NICE recommends that they shouldn\u2019t routinely be offered on the NHS. \n Rubefacients \n Rubefacients are available as gels and creams that produce a warm, reddening effect on your skin when you rub them in. Several rubefacients have been used to treat joint pain caused by osteoarthritis. \n However, research has shown that rubefacients have little effect in improving the symptoms of osteoarthritis and NICE therefore does not recommend their use. \n Good osteoarthritis care \n The Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance (ARMA) has developed a set of  standards for good osteoarthritis care (PDF, 381KB) . \n These are designed to help people of all ages with osteoarthritis lead independent lives and to be as healthy as possible. They recommend everyone should have access to: \n \n information, support and knowledge to improve bone and muscle health and enable them to manage their own condition \n the right services that enable early diagnosis and treatment \n ongoing and responsive treatment and support \n \n NICE has also produced guidance for the  care and management of osteoarthritis in adults", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "There is no definitive test to diagnose osteoarthritis, so your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your joints to help determine whether you have the condition. \n Your GP may suspect osteoarthritis if: \n \n you are 45 years of age or older \n you have joint pain that gets worse the more you use your joints \n you have stiffness in your joints in the morning that lasts less than 30 minutes, or no stiffness at all \n \n If your symptoms are slightly different from those listed above, this may indicate that you have another joint condition. For example, prolonged joint stiffness in the morning can be a sign of  rheumatoid arthritis . \n Further tests \u2013 such as  X-rays  or  blood tests  \u2013 are not usually necessary to confirm a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, although they may be used to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as rheumatoid arthritis or a fractured bone. \n X-rays can also allow doctors to assess the level of damage to your joints, but this is rarely helpful as the extent of damage visible on an X-ray isn\u2019t a good indicator of how severe your symptoms are."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Otitis externa", "introduction": "Otitis externa is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the external ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and eardrum. \n Otitis externa is often referred to as \"swimmer's ear\" because\u00a0repeated exposure to water can make the ear canal more vulnerable to inflammation. \n Symptoms of otitis externa include: \n \n ear pain, which can be severe \n itchiness in the ear canal \n a discharge of liquid or pus from the ear \n some degree of temporary  hearing loss  \n \n Usually only one ear is affected. \n With treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. However, some cases can persist for several months or longer. \n Read more about the  symptoms of otitis externa  \n When to see your GP \n You should see your GP if you may have otitis externa. \n Your GP\u00a0will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly use any items that are inserted into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They\u00a0may also examine inside\u00a0your ear using an instrument called an otoscope. \n If you have recurring episodes of otitis externa that haven't responded to treatment, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help determine what type of infection you have, if any,\u00a0so appropriate medication can be prescribed. \n What causes otitis externa? \n Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection, although\u00a0the condition\u00a0can also be caused by: \n \n irritation \n fungal infections \n allergies \n \n There are a number of things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including: \n \n damaging the skin inside your ear \n regularly getting water in your ear \n \n Getting water in your ear is particularly significant, because this can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also\u00a0provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. \n Read more about the  causes of otitis externa . \n Who is affected? \n Otitis externa is relatively common. It's estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives. \n The condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults aged 45 to 75. \n People with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition.\u00a0These include: \n \n  eczema  \n  asthma    \n  allergic rhinitis  \n \n How otitis externa is treated \n Otitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks. Your GP can prescribe ear drop medication that usually improves the symptoms within a few days. \n There are a number of\u00a0different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa, but they all tend to be used several times a day for about a week.\u00a0 \n Your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice\u00a0if symptoms are severe or they fail to respond to treatment. \n Read more about  treating otitis externa  \n Preventing otitis externa \n To help reduce your chances of developing otitis externa, you should avoid inserting\u00a0cotton wool buds and other things into your ears (including your fingers), as this can damage the sensitive skin in your ear canal. \n If you're a regular swimmer, consider using ear plugs when swimming or wearing a swimming cap\u00a0to cover your ears and protect them from water. \n You should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath. \n Read more about  preventing otitis externa  \n Complications \n Complications of otitis externa are uncommon, but some can be very serious. \n One rare complication of otitis externa is malignant otitis externa, which\u00a0is where an infection spreads from the ear canal into the surrounding bone. \n This\u00a0requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and sometimes surgery, as it can\u00a0be fatal if left untreated. \n Read more about the  complications of otitis externa", "symptoms": "Otitis externa can cause a number of different symptoms affecting the ear and the surrounding area. \n Symptoms can include: \n \n ear pain \n  itching \u00a0and irritation in and around your ear canal \n redness and swelling of your outer ear and ear canal \n a feeling of pressure and fullness inside your ear \n scaly skin in and around your ear canal, which may peel off \n discharge from your ear, which can be either thin and watery or thick and pus-like \n tenderness when you move your ear or jaw \n  swollen and sore glands \u00a0in your throat \n some  hearing loss  \n \n Otitis externa sometimes\u00a0occurs if\u00a0a hair follicle inside the ear becomes infected by bacteria and develops into a spot (pimple) or\u00a0boil. \n If this happens, you may be able to see the\u00a0pimple or boil in a mirror. However, don't attempt to squeeze\u00a0any pimples or boils in your ear, as\u00a0this could lead to the infection spreading elsewhere. \n Long-term symptoms \n In some cases,\u00a0the symptoms of otitis externa can persist for several months, or sometimes years. This is known as chronic otitis externa. \n Symptoms\u00a0of\u00a0chronic otitis externa can include: \n \n a constant itch in and around your ear canal \n discomfort and pain in your ear\u00a0that becomes worse when you move it\u00a0\u2013 this is usually much milder than in\u00a0short-term otitis externa \n a thin, watery discharge from your ear \n a lack of earwax \n a build-up of thick, dry skin in your ear canal, known as stenosis, which can narrow your ear canal and affect your hearing", "causes": "There are several different causes of otitis externa. A number of things can also increase your chance of developing the condition. \n Common causes \n Causes of otitis externa can include: \n \n a bacterial infection \u2013 usually by\u00a0bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa or\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus \n seborrhoeic dermatitis \u2013\u00a0a common skin condition where the naturally greasy areas of your skin become irritated and inflamed, which can sometimes affect the ears \n a\u00a0 middle ear infection (otitis media) \u00a0\u2013 discharge produced by an infection\u00a0deeper in the ear can sometimes lead to otitis externa \n a fungal infection \u2013 such as\u00a0from the Aspergillus variety and the Candida albicans variety (which also causes thrush); fungal infections are more common if you\u00a0use antibacterial or steroid ear drops for a long time \n irritation or an allergic reaction \u2013 otitis\u00a0externa can occur because of a reaction to something that comes into contact with your ears, such as ear medication, ear plugs, shampoo or sweat \n \n Otitis externa can also return after previous treatment if you don't complete the full course. \n Possible triggers \n The following things\u00a0aren't direct causes of otitis externa, but may make the condition more likely to develop. \n Excessive moisture \n Liquid in your ear canal can make you more likely to develop an infection.\u00a0Moisture provides an ideal environment for bacteria\u00a0\u2013 and to a lesser degree, fungi\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to grow. \n Your risk may be increased by: \n \n swimming\u00a0\u2013\u00a0particularly in dirty or polluted water \n sweating \n being exposed to humid environments \n \n Water can also wash away earwax inside your ears, which can\u00a0make them itchy. \n Ear damage \n Your ear canal is very sensitive and\u00a0may become damaged through: \n \n scratching inside your ears \n excessive cleaning \n inserting cotton buds \n wearing ear plugs or in-ear headphones for long periods \n \n Using\u00a0a hearing aid may also increase your risk of developing otitis externa. \n Chemicals \n Your chances of getting otitis externa are increased if you use certain products in or near your ears, such as: \n \n hair sprays \n hair dyes \n earwax softeners \n \n Underlying skin conditions \n As well as seborrhoeic dermatitis,\u00a0certain underlying skin conditions can\u00a0increase your risk of\u00a0otitis externa. These include:\u00a0 \n \n  psoriasis  \n  eczema  \n  acne  \n \n Allergic conditions \n If you have\u00a0allergic rhinitis or  asthma , you may be at a higher risk of developing otitis externa. \n Weak immune system \n You may be at higher risk of developing otitis externa if you have a condition that can weaken your immune system, such as: \n \n  diabetes  \n  HIV or AIDS  \n \n Certain cancer treatments, such as  chemotherapy , may also increase your risk of otitis externa.", "treatment": "Otitis externa can usually be treated effectively with ear drops prescribed by your GP and some simple self-care techniques. \n In most cases, your symptoms will start to improve within a few days of starting treatment. \n If\u00a0your symptoms are severe or they fail to respond to initial treatment, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice. \n Managing your symptoms at home \n The advice below should help to relieve your\u00a0symptoms to some extent and help to prevent complications: \n \n avoid getting your affected ear wet\u00a0\u2013\u00a0wearing a shower cap while showering and bathing can help, but you should\u00a0avoid swimming until the condition has fully cleared \n remove any discharge or debris by gently swabbing your outer ear with cotton wool, being careful not to damage it\u00a0\u2013 don't stick cotton wool or a cotton bud inside your ear \n remove anything from your affected ear that may cause an allergic reaction, such as hearing aids, ear plugs and earrings \n use painkillers such as\u00a0 paracetamol  or  ibuprofen  to relieve ear pain\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these aren't suitable for everyone, so make sure you check the information leaflet that comes with the medication first; if you're still\u00a0unsure, check with your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist \n if your condition is caused by a boil\u00a0in your ear, placing a warm flannel or cloth over the affected ear can help it heal faster \n \n Treatments your GP can provide \n While otitis externa can clear up by itself, this can take several weeks without treatment. Your GP can usually prescribe medicated ear drops that speed up the healing process. These usually need to be taken several times a day for about a week. \n There are four main types of ear drops used to treat otitis externa: \n \n antibiotic ear drops\u00a0\u2013 this can treat an underlying bacterial infection \n  corticosteroid \u00a0ear drops  \u2013 \u00a0this\u00a0can help to reduce swelling \n antifungal ear drops\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can treat an underlying fungal infection \n acidic ear drops \u2013\u00a0this can help kill bacteria \n \n Sometimes you may be given medication that's a combination of the above, such as antibiotic and corticosteroid ear drops. \n Once treatment is complete and the inflammation has settled, your doctor may want to re-examine your ear to check for any underlying physical problems that could have contributed to the condition, such as having an abnormal or perforated (torn) ear drum. \n Applying ear drops \n Ear drops may not work as well if they're not used in the right way, so it's important to apply them correctly. Ideally, ask somebody else to apply the drops for you, as this makes the process much easier. \n You (or your helper) will need to follow these steps: \n \n gently remove any discharge, earwax or debris from your outer ear using a twist of cotton wool \n warm the ear drops by holding them in your hands for a few minutes, as cold ear drops can make you feel dizzy \n lie on your side with your affected ear facing up before applying the drops directly into your external ear canal \n gently push and pull your ear for about 30 seconds to work the drops in and get any trapped air out \n stay lying down for three to five\u00a0minutes, to ensure the ear drops don't come out of your ear canal \n leave the ear canal open to dry \n \n Other treatments \n If necessary, there are some other treatments your GP can provide to help treat otitis externa, such as: \n \n stronger prescription painkillers such as codeine for severe cases \n antibiotic tablets or capsules to treat a severe infection \u2013 an antibiotic called flucloxacillin is usually the preferred choice \n treatment for\u00a0underlying skin conditions that may aggravate your otitis externa, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis,\u00a0 psoriasis  or  eczema  \n if a boil develops inside your ear, your GP may decide to pierce it with a sterile needle and drain the pus \u2013 this is known as incision and drainage,\u00a0and you shouldn't\u00a0attempt to do\u00a0it yourself \n \n Specialist treatment \n If necessary, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment. \n The specialist may decide\u00a0to remove earwax from inside your ears\u00a0to help make ear drops more effective. This can be done in a number of ways: \n \n syringing or irrigation \u2013 where water is injected through the nozzle of a syringe into the ear canal to dislodge and wash away any earwax \n microsuction \u2013 where a small suction device is used to remove any earwax, discharge and debris from your outer ear and ear canal \n dry swabbing \u2013 this gently mops out earwax from your ear canal \n \n You may also need an ear wick, which is a soft cotton gauze plug covered with medication and inserted into your ear canal. \n An ear wick allows the medication to reach the end of your ear canal. It should be changed every two to three\u00a0days.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Osteoporosis", "introduction": "Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture. \n The most common injuries\u00a0in people with osteoporosis are: \n \n wrist fractures \n  hip fractures  \n fractures of the spinal bones (vertebrae) \n \n However, they can also occur in other bones, such as in\u00a0the arm or pelvis.\u00a0Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a rib fracture or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine. \n Osteoporosis\u00a0isn't usually painful until a fracture occurs,\u00a0but spinal fractures\u00a0are a common cause of\u00a0long-term (chronic) pain. \n Although a fracture is the first sign of osteoporosis,\u00a0some older people develop\u00a0the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine\u00a0have fractured, making it difficult to support the weight of the body. \n Who's affected? \n Osteoporosis affects over three million people in the UK. \n More than\u00a0500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis. \n Causes of osteoporosis \n Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. \n Women also lose bone rapidly in the first few years after the  menopause  (when\u00a0monthly\u00a0periods\u00a0stop and the ovaries stop producing an egg). Women are more at risk of osteoporosis than men, particularly if the menopause begins early (before the age of 45). \n Many other factors can also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis, including: \n \n long-term use of high-dose\u00a0oral  corticosteroids  \n other medical\u00a0conditions\u00a0\u2013 such as inflammatory conditions, hormone-related conditions, or malabsorption problems \n a family history of osteoporosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0particularly history of a hip fracture in a parent \n long-term use of certain medications which can affect bone strength or hormone levels \n having a low\u00a0 body mass index (BMI)  \n heavy drinking and smoking \n \n Read more about the  causes of osteoporosis . \n Diagnosing osteoporosis \n Risk assessment tools \n If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an\u00a0online programme, such as\u00a0 FRAX  or Q-Fracture. \n These tools help to predict\u00a0a person's risk of fracture between the ages of\u00a040 and 90.\u00a0The algorithms\u00a0used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a\u00a0major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm. \n DEXA scan \n They may also refer you\u00a0for a DEXA (DXA) scan\u00a0to measure your bone mineral density. It's a short, painless procedure that takes\u00a0about\u00a0five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned. \n Your bone mineral density\u00a0can be\u00a0compared\u00a0to the bone mineral density of a healthy young adult and someone who's the same age and sex as you.\u00a0The difference is\u00a0calculated as a standard deviation (SD) and is called\u00a0a T score. \n Standard deviation is a measure of variability based on an average or expected value. A T score of: \n \n above -1 SD\u00a0is\u00a0normal\u00a0 \n between -1 and -2.5 SD\u00a0is defined as decreased bone mineral density compared with\u00a0peak bone mass \n below -2.5 is\u00a0defined as osteoporosis \n \n Osteopenia \n You may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased\u00a0bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis. \n Your doctor may still recommend some of the treatments described below,\u00a0depending on your results and your risk of fracture. \n Treating osteoporosis \n Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones. \n The decision about whether you need\u00a0treatment depends on your risk of fracture. This will be\u00a0based on a number of factors\u00a0such as your age, sex\u00a0and the results of your DEXA scan. \n If you need treatment, your doctor can suggest the safest and most effective treatment plan for you. \n Read more\u00a0about  how osteoporosis is treated . \n Preventing osteoporosis \n If you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should\u00a0take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include: \n \n taking\u00a0 regular exercise  \n  healthy eating \u00a0\u2013 including\u00a0foods rich in  calcium  and  vitamin\u00a0D  \n making lifestyle changes\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0 giving up smoking  and reducing your\u00a0 alcohol  consumption \n \n Read more about  preventing osteoporosis . \n Living with osteoporosis \n If you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take\u00a0to reduce your chances of a fall, such as\u00a0removing hazards from your home and having regular\u00a0 sight tests  and hearing tests. \n To help you recover from a fracture, you can try using: \n \n hot and cold\u00a0treatments\u00a0such as warm baths and cold packs \n transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small battery-operated device is used to stimulate the nerves and reduce pain \n  relaxation techniques  \n \n Speak to your GP or nurse if you're worried about living with a long-term condition. They may be able to answer any questions you have. \n You may also find it helpful to talk to a trained counsellor or psychologist, or other people\u00a0with the condition. \n The\u00a0 National Osteoporosis Society  can put you in touch with\u00a0 local support groups , and they also have an\u00a0 online discussion forum . \n Read more about  living with osteoporosis .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Osteoporosis causes bones to become less dense and more fragile. Some people are more at risk than others. \n Bones are at their thickest and strongest in your early adult life and their density increases until your late 20s. You gradually start losing bone density\u00a0from around the age of\u00a035. \n This happens\u00a0to everyone, but some people\u00a0develop osteoporosis and lose bone density much faster than normal. This means they're at greater risk of a fracture. \n Risk groups \n Osteoporosis can affect men and women.\u00a0It's more common in older people, but it can also affect younger people. \n Women \n Women are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than men because\u00a0the hormone changes that occur in the menopause directly affect bone density. \n The female hormone oestrogen is essential for healthy bones. After the  menopause \u00a0(when monthly\u00a0periods stop), oestrogen levels fall. This can\u00a0lead to a rapid decrease in bone density. \n Women are at even greater risk of developing osteoporosis if they have: \n \n an\u00a0early menopause (before the age of 45) \n a\u00a0hysterectomy (removal of the womb) before the age of 45, particularly when the ovaries are also removed \n absent periods\u00a0for more than six months as a result of overexercising or too much dieting \n \n Men \n In most cases, the cause of\u00a0osteoporosis in men is unknown. However, there's a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps keep the bones healthy. \n Men continue producing\u00a0testosterone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in\u00a0men with low levels of testosterone. \n In around half of men, the exact cause of low testosterone levels\u00a0is unknown, but known causes include: \n \n the use of certain medications, such as oral corticosteroids \n  alcohol misuse  \n hypogonadism\u00a0(a condition that causes abnormally low testosterone levels) \n \n Risk factors \n Many hormones in the body can affect the process of bone turnover. If you have a condition\u00a0of the hormone-producing glands, you may have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis. \n Hormone-related conditions that can trigger osteoporosis include: \n \n  hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)  \n disorders of the adrenal glands, such as\u00a0Cushing's syndrome \n reduced\u00a0amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone) \n disorders of the pituitary gland \n hyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands) \n \n Other risk factors \n Other factors thought to\u00a0increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include: \n \n a family history of osteoporosis \n a parental history of\u00a0hip fracture\u00a0 \n a\u00a0 body mass index (BMI)  of 19 or less \n long-term use of high-dose\u00a0oral  corticosteroids  (widely used for conditions such as\u00a0 arthritis  and  asthma ), which can affect bone strength \n having an eating disorder, such as\u00a0 anorexia  or  bulimia  \n heavy drinking and smoking \n  rheumatoid arthritis \u00a0 \n malabsorption problems, as experienced in\u00a0 coeliac disease  and\u00a0 Crohn's disease  \n some medications used to treat\u00a0 breast cancer  and\u00a0 prostate cancer \u00a0which affect hormone levels \n long periods of inactivity, such as long-term bed rest \n \n You can read more about\u00a0 who's at risk of osteoporosis and broken bones  on the\u00a0 National Osteoporosis Society website .", "treatment": "Treatment overview \n Although a diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on the results of your bone mineral density scan (DEXA or DXA scan), the decision about what treatment you need\u00a0\u2013 if any \u2013\u00a0is also based on a number of other factors. These include your: \n \n age \n sex \n risk of fracture \n previous injury history \n \n If you've been diagnosed with osteoporosis because you've had a fracture, you should still receive treatment to try to reduce your risk of further fractures. \n You may not need or want to take medication to treat osteoporosis. However, you should ensure you're maintaining sufficient\u00a0levels of calcium and\u00a0vitamin D. To achieve this, your healthcare team will ask you about your diet and may recommend making changes or taking supplements. \n NICE recommendations \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0has made some recommendations about who should be treated with medication for osteoporosis. \n A\u00a0number of factors are taken into consideration before deciding which medication to use. These include your: \n \n age \n bone mineral density (measured by your T score) \n risk factors for fracture \n \n NICE has summarised its guidance for two groups of people: \n \n postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who haven't had a fracture (primary prevention) \n postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who have had a fracture (secondary prevention) \n \n You can read the NICE guidance by clicking on the links below. \n \n NICE guidance:\u00a0 Alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility\u00a0fractures in postmenopausal women \u00a0 \n NICE guidance:\u00a0 Alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene, strontium ranelate and teriparatide for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women  \n \n Medication for osteoporosis \n A\u00a0number of different medications are used to treat osteoporosis. Your doctor will discuss the treatments available and\u00a0make sure the medicines are right for you. \n Bisphosphonates \n Bisphosphonates slow down the rate at which bone is broken down in your body. This maintains bone density and reduces the risk of fracture. \n There are a number of different bisphosphonates, including \n \n alendronate \n etidronate \n ibandronate \n risedronate \n zolendronic acid \n \n They're given as a tablet or\u00a0injection. \n You should always take bisphosphonates\u00a0on an empty stomach with a full glass of water. Stand or sit upright for 30 minutes after taking them. You'll also need to wait between 30 minutes and two hours before eating food or drinking any other fluids. \n Bisphosphonates usually take 6 to 12 months to work and you may need to take them\u00a0for five years or\u00a0longer. You may also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplements to take at a different time to the bisphosphonate. \n The main side effects associated with bisphosphonates include: \n \n irritation to the oesophagus (the tube that food passes through from the mouth to the stomach) \n  swallowing problems (dysphagia)  \n stomach pain \n \n Not everyone will experience these side effects. \n Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a\u00a0rare side effect that's linked with the use of bisphosphonates, although\u00a0most frequently with high-dose intravenous bisphosphonate treatment for  cancer \u00a0and not for osteoporosis. \n In\u00a0osteonecrosis, the cells in the jaw bone die, which can lead to problems with healing. If you have a history of dental problems, you may need a check-up before you start treatment with bisphosphonates. Speak to your doctor if you have any concerns. \n Strontium ranelate \n Strontium ranelate appears to have an effect on both the cells\u00a0that break down bone and the cells\u00a0that create new bone (osteoblasts). \n It can be used as an alternative treatment if bisphosphonates are unsuitable. Strontium ranelate is taken as a powder dissolved in water. \n The main side effects of strontium ranelate are nausea and  diarrhoea . A few people have reported a rare severe allergic reaction to the treatment. If you develop a skin rash while taking strontium ralenate, stop taking it and speak to your doctor immediately. \n Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) \n SERMs are medications that have a similar effect on bone as the hormone oestrogen. They help to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture, particularly of the spine. \n Raloxifene is the only type\u00a0of SERM that's available for treating osteoporosis. It's taken as a tablet every day. \n Side effects associated with raloxifene include: \n \n hot flushes \n  leg cramps  \n a potential increased risk of  blood clots  \n \n Parathyroid hormone (teriparatide) \n Parathyroid hormone is produced naturally in the body.\u00a0It regulates the amount of calcium in bone. \n Parathyroid hormone treatments (human recombinant parathyroid hormone or teriparatide) are used to stimulate cells that create new bone (osteoblasts). They're given by injection. \n While\u00a0other medication\u00a0can only slow down the rate of bone thinning, parathyroid hormone can increase bone density. However, it's only used in a small number of people whose bone density is very low and when other treatments aren't working. \n Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of the treatment. Parathyroid hormone treatments should only be prescribed by a specialist. \n Calcium and vitamin D supplements \n Calcium\u00a0is the major mineral found in bone, and having enough calcium as part of a\u00a0 healthy, balanced diet  is important for maintaining healthy bones. \n For most healthy adults, the recommended amount of calcium is 700 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day, which most people should be able to get from a varied diet that contains good sources of calcium. \n However, if you have osteoporosis you may need more calcium, which will usually be in the form of supplements. Ask your GP for advice about taking calcium supplements. \n Vitamin D\u00a0is needed to help the body absorb calcium. It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from your diet alone because few foods contain vitamin D. In the UK, most healthy adults obtain vitamin D from exposing the skin to summer sunlight. \n However, for people at risk of not getting enough vitamin D, supplementation with 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day (400 international units [IU]) is\u00a0recommended to prevent deficiency. \n At-risk groups include people over 65 years of age,\u00a0and people who aren't exposed to much sunlight because they cover their skin for cultural reasons, are housebound, or who stay indoors for long periods. \n If you're found to lack vitamin D, your GP may prescribe supplements at a higher dose than the above recommendation to correct the deficiency. \n Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \n  HRT  is sometimes recommended for women who are experiencing the  menopause , as it can help control symptoms. \n HRT has also been shown to maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fracture during treatment. \n However, HRT isn't specifically recommended for treating osteoporosis and it isn't often used for this purpose. \n This is because HRT slightly increases\u00a0the risk\u00a0of developing certain conditions, such as  breast cancer ,  endometrial cancer ,\u00a0 ovarian cancer ,  stroke \u00a0and venous thromboembolism more than it lowers the risk of osteoporosis. \n Discuss the benefits and risks of HRT with your GP. \n Read more about the\u00a0 risks of HRT . \n Testosterone treatment \n In men, testosterone treatment can be useful when osteoporosis is caused by insufficient production of male sex hormones (hypogonadism).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

This is called Barrett's oesophagus. \n These abnormal cells are at an increased risk of becoming cancerous in the future, although the risk is still small.\u00a0It's estimated that\u00a0one in every 10-20 people with Barrett's oesophagus will develop cancer within 10-20 years. \n Alcohol \n Drinking too much alcohol\u00a0causes irritation and inflammation in the lining of the oesophagus. \n If the cells in the lining of your gullet become inflamed,\u00a0they're more likely to become cancerous. \n Read more about\u00a0 alcohol and drinking , including tips on cutting down \n Smoking \n Tobacco smoke contains many harmful toxins and chemicals.

The endoscope is passed down your throat so no incisions are made in your skin. \n Sometimes radiowaves may also be used to destroy the cancerous tissue (called radiofrequency ablation or RFA). \n Stents \n For more advanced cases of oesophageal cancer that are causing swallowing difficulties,\u00a0a procedure to insert a hollow tube called a stent into the oesophagus may be recommended. \n The stent expands once in place and holds the oesophagus open. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0involves taking medicines that kill the cancer cells or stop them multiplying. \n It may be used: \n \n before and sometimes after surgery, either\u00a0with or without radiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 to shrink the cancer and reduce the\u00a0risk of it coming back \n instead of surgery\u00a0\u2013 in\u00a0combination with radiotherapy (called chemoradiation) \n to relieve your symptoms if\u00a0curative treatment\u00a0isn't possible \n \n The medicines can be\u00a0given into a vein\u00a0or taken as tablets. You'll usually have the treatment\u00a0every three weeks\u00a0over a\u00a0period of\u00a06-18 weeks. \n Side effects \n Common side effects of chemotherapy include: \n \n feeling sick \n loss of appetite \n losing weight \n  diarrhoea  \n feeling very tired \n increased risk of\u00a0infections \n bleeding and bruising easily \n \n These side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy  \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0involves using\u00a0radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours. \n It may be used: \n \n in combination with chemotherapy before surgery\u00a0\u2013 to shrink the cancer and reduce the\u00a0risk of it coming back \n instead of surgery\u00a0\u2013 usually in combination with chemotherapy (called chemoradiation) \n to relieve\u00a0your symptoms if curative treatment isn't possible \n \n Radiotherapy is most often given using an external machine that directs beams of radiation at your oesophagus, or sometimes by temporarily placing a small piece of radioactive material in your oesophagus (brachytherapy). \n Side effects \n Common side effects of radiotherapy include: \n \n tiredness \n temporary soreness when swallowing \n temporary worsening of swallowing difficulties \n a dry throat \n feeling or being sick \n reddening of the skin and loss of body hair in the treatment area \n \n These side effects should improve gradually after treatment stops.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  side effects of radiotherapy  \n  Want to know more?  \n \n Cancer Research UK:\u00a0 treatments for oesophageal cancer  \n Macmillan:\u00a0 treatments for oesophageal cancer", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you experience  symptoms of oesophageal cancer .

This is called a  biopsy . \n You'll be awake while\u00a0an endoscopy is carried out. It shouldn't be painful, but may be a bit uncomfortable. \n You'll normally be given  local anaesthetic \u00a0to numb your throat\u00a0and possibly a\u00a0sedative to help you relax. \n Barium swallow\u00a0or barium meal \n A barium swallow or barium meal involves drinking a harmless white liquid called barium before several\u00a0 X-rays \u00a0are taken. \n The barium coats the lining of your oesophagus so it shows up on the X-ray. This can show whether there's anything blocking\u00a0your oesophagus, which may be a sign of cancer. \n This test isn't used to diagnose oesophageal cancer very often nowadays because the best way to confirm a diagnosis is to use tissue samples taken during an endoscopy. \n Further tests \n If\u00a0you have oesophageal cancer, further tests will\u00a0be\u00a0recommended to determine how far the cancer has spread\u00a0\u2013 known as called the \"stage\".

This involves scoring the cancer in three categories: \n \n T (tumour) \u2013 the location and size of the tumour \n N (node) \u2013 whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (a network of glands throughout the body) \n M (metastasis) \u2013 whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver or bones \n \n Scores for each\u00a0category are then often used in a simpler number system, ranging from stage 1 (early cancer) to stage 4 (advanced cancer). \n Knowing the stage of your cancer will help your\u00a0care team\u00a0work out the best treatment for you. \n Read more about  treatments for oesophageal cancer  \n Want to know more? \n \n Cancer Research UK:\u00a0 diagnosing oesophageal cancer  \n Cancer Research UK:\u00a0 stages and grades of oesophageal cancer  \n Macmillan:\u00a0 how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed  \n Macmillan:\u00a0 staging oesophageal cancer"},

It is not contagious and is usually successfully treated with antifungal medication. \n It is also called oral candidosis (or candiasis) because it is caused by a group of yeasts called Candida. \n Symptoms of oral thrush\u00a0can\u00a0include: \n \n white patches (plaques) in the mouth that can often be wiped off, leaving behind red\u00a0areas that may bleed slightly \n loss of taste or an unpleasant taste in the mouth \n redness inside the mouth and throat \n cracks at the corners of the mouth \n a painful, burning sensation in the mouth \n \n In some cases, the symptoms of oral thrush can make eating and drinking difficult. \n When to seek medical advice \n Speak to your GP if you develop symptoms of oral thrush. If left untreated, the symptoms will often persist and your mouth will continue to feel uncomfortable. \n In severe cases that are left untreated, there is also a risk of the infection spreading further into your body, which can be serious. \n Your GP will usually\u00a0be able to diagnose oral thrush simply by examining your mouth. Sometimes they may also recommend  blood tests  to look for certain conditions associated with oral thrush, such as\u00a0 diabetes  and nutritional deficiencies. \n What causes oral thrush? \n Low numbers of the fungus Candida are naturally found in the mouth and digestive system of most people. They don't usually cause any problems, but can lead to oral thrush if they multiply. \n There are a number of reasons why this may happen, including: \n \n taking a course of  antibiotics , particularly over a long period or at a high dose \n taking\u00a0 inhaled corticosteroid medication \u00a0for  asthma  \n wearing\u00a0 dentures  (false teeth), particularly if they don't fit properly \n having poor\u00a0oral hygiene \n having a dry mouth, either because of a medical\u00a0condition or a medication you are taking \n smoking \n having\u00a0 chemotherapy  or\u00a0 radiotherapy  to treat  cancer  \n \n Babies, young children and elderly people are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush, as are people with certain underlying conditions, including diabetes, an  iron deficiency  or  vitamin B12 deficiency , an  underactive thyroid  (hypothyroidism) and\u00a0 HIV . \n As most people already have Candida fungi living in their mouth, oral thrush is not contagious. This means it cannot be passed to others. \n Treating oral thrush \n Oral thrush can usually be successfully treated with antifungal medicines. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth (topical medication), although tablets or capsules are sometimes used. \n Topical medication will usually need to be used several times a day for around\u00a07 to 14 days. Tablet or capsules are usually taken once daily. \n These medications don't often\u00a0have side effects, although some can cause\u00a0nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, bloating,  abdominal (tummy) pain  and  diarrhoea . \n If antibiotics or corticosteroids are thought to be causing your oral thrush, the medicine\u00a0\u2013 or the way it is delivered\u00a0\u2013 may need to be changed or the dosage reduced. \n Preventing oral thrush \n There are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of developing oral thrush, including: \n \n rinsing your mouth after meals \n brushing your teeth twice a day with a toothpaste that contains fluoride and interdental cleaning (flossing) regularly \n visiting your dentist regularly for check-ups, even if you\u00a0wear dentures or have no natural teeth \n removing your dentures every night, cleaning them\u00a0with paste or soap and water before soaking them\u00a0in a solution of water and denture-cleaning tablets \n brushing your gums, tongue\u00a0and inside your mouth with a soft brush\u00a0twice a\u00a0day if you wear dentures or have no or few natural teeth \n visiting your dentist if your dentures\u00a0do not fit properly \n  stopping smoking \u00a0if you smoke \n rinsing your mouth with water and spitting it out after using a corticosteroid inhaler, and\u00a0using a spacer (a plastic cylinder that attaches to\u00a0the inhaler) when you take your medicine \n ensuring that any underlying condition you have, such as diabetes, is well controlled \n \n If you have a condition or are receiving treatment that could put you at a high risk of developing oral thrush, your doctor\u00a0may recommend taking a course of antifungal medication to prevent this happening. \n Read more about\u00a0 taking care of your oral health .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Obstructive sleep apnoea", "introduction": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing. \n This\u00a0may lead to regularly\u00a0interrupted sleep, which can have a big impact on quality of life and increases the risk of developing certain conditions. \n Apnoea and hypopnoea \n There are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA: \n \n apnoea \u2013 where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it's called an apnoea when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more \n hypopnoea \u2013\u00a0a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more \n \n People with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night.\u00a0These events may occur around once every one or two\u00a0minutes in severe cases. \n As\u00a0many people with OSA experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea, doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, or OSAHS. \n The term \"obstructive\" distinguishes OSA from rarer forms of sleep apnoea, such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending\u00a0signals to the breathing muscles during sleep. \n Symptoms of OSA \n The symptoms of OSA are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep. \n Signs of OSA in someone sleeping can include: \n \n loud\u00a0snoring \n noisy and laboured breathing \n repeated short periods\u00a0where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting \n \n Some people with OSA may also experience\u00a0night sweats and may wake up frequently during the night to urinate. \n During an episode, the lack of oxygen\u00a0triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep\u00a0\u2013 either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness\u00a0\u2013\u00a0so your airway reopens and you can breathe normally. \n These repeated sleep interruptions can make you\u00a0feel very tired during the day. You'll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you\u00a0may be unaware you have a problem. \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you think you might have OSA. \n They\u00a0can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and can arrange for an assessment of your sleep to be carried out through a local sleep centre. \n As someone with OSA may not notice they have the condition, it often goes undiagnosed. \n Read more about  diagnosing OSA . \n Causes of OSA \n It's normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping. For most people this doesn't cause breathing problems. \n In people with OSA the airway has narrowed as the result of a number of factors, including: \n \n being overweight \u2013\u00a0excessive body fat increases the bulk of soft tissue in the neck, which can place a strain on the throat muscles; excess stomach fat can also lead to breathing difficulties, which can make OSA worse \n being male \u2013\u00a0it's not known why OSA is more common in men than in women, but it may be related to different patterns of body fat distribution \n being 40 years of age or more \u2013 although OSA can occur at any age, it's more common in people who are over 40 \n having a large neck \u2013\u00a0men with a collar size greater than around 43cm (17 inches) have an increased risk of developing OSA \n taking medicines\u00a0with a sedative effect \u2013\u00a0such as sleeping tablets or tranquillisers \n having an unusual inner neck structure \u2013 such as a narrow airway, large tonsils, adenoids\u00a0or tongue, or a small lower jaw \n alcohol \u2013\u00a0drinking alcohol, particularly before going\u00a0to sleep,\u00a0can make snoring and sleep apnoea worse \n smoking \u2013\u00a0you're more likely to develop sleep apnoea if you smoke \n the menopause (in women) \u2013\u00a0the changes in hormone levels during the  menopause  may cause the throat muscles to relax more than usual \n having a family history of OSA \u2013\u00a0there may be genes inherited from your parents that can make you more susceptible to OSA \n nasal congestion \u2013\u00a0OSA occurs more often in people with nasal congestion, such as a deviated septum, where the tissue in the nose that divides the two nostrils is bent to one side, or nasal polyps, which may be\u00a0a result of the airways being narrowed \n \n Treating OSA \n OSA is a treatable condition, and there\u00a0are a variety of treatment options that can\u00a0reduce the symptoms. \n Treatment options\u00a0for OSA include: \n \n lifestyle changes \u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0losing excess weight, cutting down on alcohol and sleeping on your side \n using\u00a0a\u00a0continuous\u00a0positive airway pressure (CPAP) device \u2013 these devices\u00a0prevent your airway closing while you sleep by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask \n wearing a\u00a0mandibular advancement device (MAD)\u00a0\u2013 this gum shield-like device fits around your teeth, holding\u00a0your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat while you sleep \n \n Surgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically, such as an unusual inner neck structure. \n However, for most people surgery isn't appropriate and may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven't helped. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating OSA . \n Complications of OSA \n The treatments mentioned above can often help control the symptoms of OSA, although treatment will need to be lifelong in most cases. \n If OSA is left untreated, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life, causing problems such as\u00a0poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships with others. \n Poorly controlled OSA\u00a0may also\u00a0increase your risk of: \n \n developing  high blood pressure (hypertension)  \n having a\u00a0 stroke  or  heart attack  \n developing an irregular heartbeat\u00a0\u2013 such as  atrial fibrillation  \n developing  type 2 diabetes \u00a0\u2013 although it's unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity \n \n Research has\u00a0shown someone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be up to 12 times more likely to be involved in a car accident. \n If you're diagnosed with OSA, it\u00a0may mean your ability to drive is affected. It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could have an impact on your driving ability. \n Once a diagnosis of OSA has been made, you shouldn't drive until\u00a0your symptoms are well controlled. \n The GOV.UK website has advice about  how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition . \n Preventing OSA \n It's not always possible to prevent OSA, but making certain lifestyle changes\u00a0may reduce your risk of developing the condition. \n These include: \n \n  losing weight  if you're overweight or obese \n limiting\u00a0how much  alcohol  you drink and avoiding alcohol\u00a0in the evening \n  stopping smoking  if you smoke \n avoiding the use of sleeping tablets and tranquillisers", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may include making lifestyle changes and using breathing apparatus while you sleep. \n OSA is a long-term condition and many cases require lifelong treatment. \n Lifestyle changes \n In\u00a0most cases of\u00a0OSA you'll be advised to make healthy lifestyle changes,\u00a0such\u00a0as: \n \n  losing weight \u00a0if you're overweight or obese \n  stopping smoking  if you smoke \n limiting your alcohol consumption, particularly before going to bed\u00a0\u2013 the NHS recommends not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week; if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over three or more days \n avoiding\u00a0sedative medications and sleeping tablets \n \n Losing weight, reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and avoiding sedatives\u00a0have all\u00a0been shown to\u00a0help improve the symptoms of OSA.\u00a0 \n Although it's\u00a0less clear whether stopping smoking can improve the condition,\u00a0you'll probably\u00a0be advised to stop for general health reasons. \n Sleeping on your side, rather than on your back, may also help relieve the symptoms of OSA. \n Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) \n As well as\u00a0the lifestyle changes mentioned above, people with moderate to severe OSA\u00a0usually\u00a0need to\u00a0use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. \n This is a small pump\u00a0that\u00a0delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask that\u00a0either covers your nose or your nose and mouth. The compressed air prevents your throat closing. \n CPAP can feel peculiar to start with and\u00a0you may be tempted to stop using it.\u00a0But people who persevere\u00a0usually soon\u00a0get used to\u00a0it and their symptoms improve significantly. \n CPAP is available on the NHS and is the most effective therapy for treating severe cases of OSA. \n As well as reducing symptoms such as snoring and tiredness, it can also reduce the risk of\u00a0complications of OSA, such as  high blood pressure . \n Possible side effects of using a CPAP device can include: \n \n mask discomfort \n nasal congestion, runny nose or irritation \n difficulty breathing through your nose \n headaches and ear pain \n stomach pain and flatulence (wind) \n \n Earlier versions of CPAP also often caused problems such as nasal dryness and a sore throat. However, modern versions tend to include humidifiers, a device that increases moisture, which helps reduce these side effects. \n If CPAP causes you discomfort, inform your treatment staff\u00a0as the device can be modified to make it more comfortable. For example, you can try using a CPAP machine that starts with a low air pressure and gradually builds up to a higher air pressure as you fall asleep. \n Mandibular advancement device (MAD) \n A mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental appliance, similar to a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild OSA.\u00a0 \n They're not generally recommended for more severe OSA, although they may be an option if you're unable to tolerate using a CPAP device. \n An MAD is worn over your teeth when you're asleep. It's designed to hold your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat and reduce the narrowing of your airway that causes snoring. \n Off-the-shelf MADs are available from specialist websites, but most experts don't recommend them, as poor-fitting MADs can make symptoms worse. \n It's recommended you have an MAD made for you by a dentist with training and experience in treating sleep apnoea. MADs aren't always available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for the device privately through a dentist or orthodontist. \n An MAD may not be suitable treatment for you if you don't have many\u00a0\u2013 or any\u00a0\u2013\u00a0teeth. If you have dental caps, crowns or bridgework, consult your dentist to ensure they won't be stressed or damaged by an MAD. \n Surgery for OSA \n Surgery to treat OSA isn't routinely recommended because evidence shows it's not as effective as CPAP at controlling the symptoms of the condition. It also carries\u00a0the risk of more serious complications. \n Surgery is usually only considered as a last resort when all other treatment options have failed, and also if the condition\u00a0is severely affecting your quality of life. \n A\u00a0range of surgical treatments\u00a0have been used to treat OSA. These include: \n \n tonsillectomy \u2013 where the tonsils are removed if they're enlarged and blocking your airway when you sleep \n adenoidectomy\u00a0\u2013 where the adenoids, small lumps of tissue\u00a0at the back of the throat above the tonsils, are removed if they're enlarged and are blocking the airway during sleep \n tracheostomy\u00a0\u2013 where a tube is inserted directly into your neck to allow you to breathe freely, even if the airways in your upper throat are blocked \n weight loss (bariatric) surgery\u00a0\u2013 where the size of the stomach is reduced if you're severely obese and\u00a0this is making your sleep apnoea\u00a0worse \n \n Surgery to\u00a0remove excess tissue in the throat to widen your airway (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty) used to be a common surgical treatment for OSA, but it's performed less often nowadays. \n This is\u00a0because more effective treatments are available, such as CPAP. This type of surgery can mean you're unable to use a CPAP device properly in the future if you need to. \n Soft palate implants \n Soft palate implants make the soft palate, part of the roof of the mouth, stiffer and less likely to vibrate and cause an obstruction. The implants are inserted into the soft palate under  local anaesthetic . \n The National Institute\u00a0for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said soft palate implants are safe, but they're not currently recommended for treating OSA\u00a0as there's a lack of evidence about their effectiveness. \n However, this form of treatment is recommended for treating snoring associated with OSA in exceptional cases. \n Support groups \n OSA can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families. \n As well as causing physical problems such as tiredness and headaches, the condition can have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others. \n For support and advice about living with OSA, you may find it helpful to contact a support group, such as: \n \n  British Lung Foundation  \n  Sleep Apnoea Trust", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can usually be diagnosed after you've been observed sleeping at a sleep clinic, or by using a testing device worn overnight at home. \n If you think you have OSA, it's important to visit your GP in case you need to be referred to a sleep specialist for further tests and treatment. \n Before seeing your GP it may be helpful to\u00a0ask a partner, friend or relative to observe you while you're asleep, if possible. If you have OSA, they may be able to spot episodes of breathlessness. \n It may also help to fill out an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. This\u00a0asks\u00a0how likely you'll be to\u00a0doze off in a number of different situations, such as watching TV or\u00a0sitting in a meeting.\u00a0 \n The final score will help your doctor\u00a0determine whether you may have a sleep disorder. \n For example,\u00a0a score of 16-24 means you're excessively sleepy and should consider seeking medical attention. A score of eight to nine is considered average during the daytime. \n An online version of the  Epworth Sleepiness Scale \u00a0can be found on the British Lung Foundation website. \n Seeing your GP \n When you see your GP, they'll usually\u00a0ask a number of questions about your symptoms, such as whether you regularly fall asleep during the day against your will. \n Your blood pressure will be measured and a blood sample probably sent off to help rule out other conditions that could explain your tiredness, such as\u00a0an underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ). \n The next step is to observe you while you're asleep at a local sleep centre. Your GP can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help treat people with sleep disorders. \n The Sleep Apnoea Trust Association has a list of  NHS sleep clinics in the UK . \n Observing your sleep \n The sleep specialists at the sleep centre may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and carry out a physical examination. \n This may include measuring your height and weight to work out your  body mass index (BMI) , as well as measuring\u00a0your neck circumference. This is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of OSA. \n The sleep specialists will then arrange for\u00a0your sleep to\u00a0be assessed overnight, either by spending the night at the clinic or taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse. \n Testing at home \n In many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home. \n The equipment you are given may include: \n \n a breathing sensor \n sensors to monitor your heart rate \n bands that are placed around your chest \n oxygen sensors that are put\u00a0on your finger \n \n The equipment records oxygen\u00a0levels, breathing movements, heart rate and snoring through the night. \n If more information about sleep quality is required, a more detailed investigation called\u00a0polysomnography\u00a0will be required, which will be carried out at the sleep centre. \n Testing at a sleep centre \n The main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as\u00a0polysomnography. \n During the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep. \n Bands and small metallic discs called electrodes\u00a0are placed on the surface of your skin and\u00a0different parts of your body. Sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger. \n A number of different tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including: \n \n electroencephalography (EEG)\u00a0\u2013 this monitors brain waves \n electromyography (EMG) \u2013 this monitors muscle tone \n recordings of movements in your chest and abdomen \n recordings of airflow through your mouth and nose \n pulse oximetry \u2013 this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels \n electrocardiography (ECG) \u2013 this monitors your heart \n \n Sound recording and video equipment may also be used. \n If OSA is diagnosed during the early part of the night, you may be given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP involves using a mask that delivers constant compressed air to the airway and stops it closing, which prevents OSA. \n Read about  treating OSA  for more information about CPAP. \n Once the tests have been completed, staff at the sleep centre should have a good idea about whether or not you have OSA. If you do, they can determine how much it is interrupting your sleep and recommend appropriate treatment. \n Determining the severity of OSA \n The severity of OSA is determined by how\u00a0often your breathing is affected over the course of an hour. These episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). \n Severity is measured using the following criteria: \n \n mild \u2013\u00a0an AHI reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour \n moderate \u2013\u00a0an AHI reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour \n severe \u2013\u00a0an AHI reading of more than 30 episodes an hour \n \n Current evidence suggests treatment is most likely to be beneficial in people with moderate or severe OSA. However, some research has suggested treatment may also help some people with mild OSA."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)", "introduction": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive activity. \n An obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters a person's mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease. \n A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought. \n For example, someone with a fear of their house being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave the house. \n OCD symptoms can range from mild to severe. Some people with OCD may spend an hour or so a day engaged in obsessive-compulsive thinking and behaviour, but for others the condition can completely take over their life. \n Read more about the  symptoms of OCD . \n What causes OCD? \n It's not clear exactly what causes OCD, although a number of factors have been suggested. \n In some cases the condition\u00a0may run in families, and\u00a0may be\u00a0linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain's development. \n Brain imaging studies have shown the brains of some people with OCD can be different\u00a0from the brains of\u00a0people who do not have the condition. \n For example, there may be\u00a0increased activity\u00a0in certain areas of the brain, particularly those that deal with strong emotions and the responses to them. \n Studies have also shown\u00a0people with OCD have an imbalance of serotonin in their brain. Serotonin is a chemical the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another. \n Read more about the  causes of OCD . \n Who is affected? \n It's estimated around 12 in every 1,000 people in the UK are affected by the condition. This equates to almost 750,000 people. \n OCD\u00a0affects men, women and children. The condition typically\u00a0first starts to significantly interfere with a person's life during early adulthood, although problems can develop at any age. \n Getting help \n People with OCD are often reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed\u00a0or embarrassed. \n However,\u00a0if you have OCD,\u00a0there is nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. It is a long-term health condition like\u00a0 diabetes  or  asthma ,\u00a0and it\u00a0is not your fault you have it. \n Seeking help is important because it is unlikely your symptoms will improve if left\u00a0untreated, and they may get worse. \n You should visit\u00a0your GP if you think you may have OCD. Initially, they will probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect you. \n If your GP suspects OCD, you may need to be\u00a0referred to a specialist for an assessment and appropriate treatment. \n Read more about  diagnosing OCD . \n How\u00a0OCD is treated \n With treatment, the outlook for OCD is good. Many people will eventually be cured of their OCD, or their symptoms will at least be reduced enough\u00a0that they can enjoy a good quality of life. \n The main treatments for OCD are: \n \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 involving a therapy known as graded exposure with response prevention (ERP), which encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"neutralising\" them with compulsions \n selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u2013\u00a0this medication can help reduce your symptoms by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain \n \n If these treatments aren't effective or your condition is particularly severe,\u00a0you may need to be referred to a specialist mental health service for treatment. \n Read more about  treating OCD .", "symptoms": "Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) affects people differently, but usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour. \n This pattern has four main steps: \n \n obsession \u2013\u00a0where an unwanted, intrusive and often distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters\u00a0your mind \n anxiety \u2013\u00a0the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety\u00a0or distress \n compulsion \u2013\u00a0repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel driven to perform as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession \n temporary relief \u2013\u00a0the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief from anxiety, but the obsession and anxiety soon return, causing the cycle to begin again \n \n Obsessive thoughts \n Almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life, such as a concern that they may have forgotten to lock the door of the house or that they may contract a disease from touching other people, or even sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images. \n Most people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context, and they can carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance. \n However, if you have a persistent, unwanted and unpleasant thought that dominates your thinking to the extent it interrupts other thoughts, you may have developed an obsession. \n Some common obsessions that affect people with OCD include: \n \n fear of deliberately harming yourself or others \u2013 for example, fear\u00a0you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you \n fear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident \u2013\u00a0for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on \n fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance \n a need for symmetry or orderliness \u2013 for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the labels on the tins in your cupboard face the same way \n \n Compulsive behaviour \n Compulsions arise as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not realistically connected at all. \n For example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands\u00a0repeatedly throughout the day, or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to \"neutralise\" the thought of harm. This latter type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD. \n Most people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational and makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion. \n Some common types of compulsive behaviour that affect people with OCD include: \n \n cleaning and hand washing \n checking\u00a0\u2013 such as checking doors are locked, or that the gas or a tap is off \n counting \n ordering and arranging \n hoarding \n asking for reassurance \n repeating words silently \n extensively \"overthinking\" to ensure the feared consequence of the obsession does not occur\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you fear you may act violently \n thinking \"neutralising\" thoughts to counter the obsessive thoughts \n avoiding places and\u00a0situations that could trigger obsessive thoughts \n \n Not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people. \n Related problems \n Some people with OCD may also have or develop other serious mental health problems, including: \n \n  depression \u00a0\u2013 a condition that typically causes lasting feelings of sadness and hopelessness, or\u00a0a loss of interest in the things you used to enjoy \n eating disorders\u00a0\u2013 conditions\u00a0characterised by an abnormal attitude towards food that cause you to change\u00a0your eating habits and behaviour \n generalised anxiety disorder \u2013\u00a0a condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event \n a hoarding disorder \u2013 a condition that involves excessively acquiring items and not being able to throw them away, resulting in unmanageable amounts of clutter \n \n People with OCD and severe depression also frequently have  suicidal  feelings. \n Getting help \n OCD can stop you carrying out normal day-to-day activities and can have a significant\u00a0impact on your career, education and social life. \n It is therefore important\u00a0to seek help from your GP if you think you have the condition. With the correct diagnosis and treatment, you should be able to manage your\u00a0symptoms and have a better quality of life. \n You should also visit your GP if you think you may have one of the related mental health problems mentioned above, as these conditions\u00a0may become more severe if they are left untreated and\u00a0may make it more difficult for you to cope with your OCD. \n Contact your GP or care team immediately if you are depressed and feeling suicidal. You can also telephone the Samaritans to talk in confidence to a counsellor on 08457 90 90 90. Alternatively, you can call NHS 111. \n If you think a friend or family member may have OCD, it's a good idea to talk to them about your concerns and suggest they seek medical advice. \n While it might seem natural to try\u00a0to protect the person with OCD from their own fears,\u00a0this is counterproductive because it means the problem is not resolved and there is no hope of moving on. \n Read more about  diagnosing OCD .", "causes": "Despite much research being carried out into obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), the exact cause of the condition has not yet been identified. \n However, a number of different factors that may play a role in the condition have been suggested. These are described below. \n Genetics \n Genetics\u00a0is\u00a0thought to play a part\u00a0in some cases of OCD. Research suggests OCD may be the result of certain inherited genes that affect the development of the brain. \n Although no specific genes have been linked to OCD, there is some evidence that suggests a\u00a0person with OCD is more likely to have another family member with the condition compared with someone who does not have OCD. \n However, it is possible there may sometimes be other reasons for this. For example, it has been suggested some people may \"learn\" OCD as a result of\u00a0witnessing other family members with the condition. \n Brain differences \n Brain imaging studies have shown some people with OCD have differences in\u00a0certain parts of their brain, including increased activity and\u00a0blood flow, and a lack of the brain chemical serotonin. \n The areas of the brain affected\u00a0deal with strong emotions and how we respond\u00a0to those emotions. In the studies, brain activity returned to normal after successful treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0or\u00a0 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . \n Serotonin \n Serotonin may play a part in OCD.\u00a0This\u00a0brain chemical transmits information from one brain cell to another and is known as a neurotransmitter. \n Serotonin is responsible for regulating a number of the body's functions, including mood, anxiety, memory and sleep. \n It is not known for sure how serotonin contributes to OCD, but some people with the condition appear\u00a0to have decreased levels of the chemical\u00a0in their brain. \n Medication that increases the levels of serotonin in the brain, such as certain types of\u00a0 antidepressant , have proven effective\u00a0in treating OCD. \n Life events \n OCD may be more common in people with a history of having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse, neglect, social isolation, teasing or bullying. \n An important\u00a0life event, such as a bereavement,\u00a0family break-up, a new job, pregnancy or childbirth,\u00a0may also trigger\u00a0OCD in people who already have a tendency to develop\u00a0the condition\u00a0\u2013 for example, because of genetic factors\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and may affect the course of the condition. \n For example, the death of a loved one may trigger a fear that someone in your family will be harmed. \n Stress seems to make the\u00a0symptoms of OCD\u00a0worse, but does not cause OCD on its own. \n Personality \n People with certain personality traits may be more likely to have OCD. For example,\u00a0if you are a neat, meticulous, methodical person with high standards\u00a0\u2013 a \"perfectionist\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may be more likely to develop the condition. \n OCD may also be a result of simply being\u00a0more prone to becoming tense and anxious than most people, or having a\u00a0very strong sense of responsibility for\u00a0yourself and others.", "treatment": "Treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) depends on the how much the condition is affecting your daily life. \n The two main treatments are: \n \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) involving graded exposure and response prevention (ERP) \u2013 therapy that encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"putting them right\" or \"neutralising\" them with compulsions \n medication \u2013 to control your symptoms by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain \n \n OCD that has a relatively minor impact on your daily life is usually treated with a short course of CBT involving ERP. \n If you have OCD that has a more significant impact on your daily life, a more intensive course of CBT with ERP or a type of medication known as\u00a0selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be recommended instead. You may also be referred to a specialist mental health service. \n If your OCD has a severe impact on your daily life, you will usually be referred to a specialist mental health service for a combination of intensive CBT and a course of SSRIs. \n Children with OCD are usually referred to a healthcare professional with experience of treating OCD in children. \n The level of treatment for OCD can be increased in steps until it is effective. For example, if a short course of CBT does not help, you may move on to trying SSRIs. \n It's important to remember it can take several months before a treatment has a noticeable effect. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy with exposure and response prevention \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that involves exposure and response prevention (ERP) can be used to help people with OCD of all severities. \n People with mild to moderate OCD usually need about 10 hours of therapist treatment, combined with exercises done at home between sessions. \n Those with moderate to severe OCD may need a more intensive course of CBT that lasts longer than 10 hours. \n During the sessions, you will work with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts, such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions. \n Your therapist will also need to ask you to use a technique called graded ERP. This therapy encourages you to face your fear and let the obsessive thoughts occur without \"putting them right\" or neutralising them with compulsions. \n It requires motivation and is difficult, but should start with situations that cause you the least anxiety first. \n These exposure exercises need to take place several times a day, and need to be done for one to two hours without engaging in compulsions to undo them. \n Although this sounds frightening, people with OCD find that when they confront their anxiety without carrying out their compulsion, the anxiety does eventually improve or go away. Each time, the anxiety is likely to be less and last for a shorter period of time. \n Once you have conquered one exposure task, you can move on to a more difficult task, until you have overcome all of the situations that make you anxious.\u00a0 \n Medication \n You may need medication if CBT fails to treat mild OCD or if you have moderate or severe OCD. The main type of medication you may be prescribed is discussed below. \n If these medications prove ineffective, you will be referred to a specialist mental health service. \n Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors \n Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of\u00a0 antidepressant medication  that increase the levels of a chemical called serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter the brain uses to transmit information from one brain cell to another. \n Although SSRIs are a type of antidepressant, they have been shown to work in people with OCD regardless of their level of depression. The doses\u00a0that have been shown to be effective in OCD are also higher than those generally used for depression. \n Possible SSRIs you may be prescribed include: \n \n citalopram \n escitalopram \n fluoxetine \n fluvoxamine \n paroxetine \n sertraline \n \n You will usually need to take an SSRI for 12 weeks before you notice any benefit. Most people with moderate to severe OCD need to take one for at least 12 months. \n After this time, your condition will be reviewed. If it causes few or no troublesome symptoms, you may be able to stop taking the medication. \n People with more severe OCD, however, may need to take the medication for many years to prevent the condition recurring. \n Possible side effects of SSRIs can include  headaches , feeling agitated or shaky, and feeling sick. However, these will often pass within a few weeks. \n SSRIs can also affect your heart, so it is advisable to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) after being on the medication for a few weeks.\u00a0An ECG is a simple test to measure the electrical activity of your heart. \n There is also an extremely small chance that SSRIs will increase your anxiety, which can very occasionally cause you to have\u00a0 suicidal  thoughts or a desire to\u00a0self-harm. \n Contact your GP immediately or go to\u00a0your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department if you are taking an SSRI and have suicidal thoughts or want to self-harm. \n You may also have side effects when you stop taking SSRIs, so you shouldn't stop taking your medicine suddenly. If you no longer need the medicine, your GP will gradually reduce your dose. \n To find out more about the possible side effects, check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. \n Further treatment \n Further specialist treatment may sometimes be necessary if you have tried all the treatments above and your OCD is still not under control. \n Some people with severe, long-term, difficult-to-treat (refractory)\u00a0OCD may be referred to the National Service for Refractory OCD centre. \n The service offers assessment and treatment to people with OCD who have not responded to treatments available from their local and regional OCD specialist services. \n To be eligible for this service, you must have been diagnosed as having severe OCD and have received: \n \n at least two full trials of different SSRIs at recommended doses \n two trials of unsuccessful CBT treatments both in a clinic and at home \n additional treatment with a dopamine-blocking agent medication or an SSRI at a dose higher than normally recommended \n \n Most people improve after receiving treatment from the national service.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It is very important you visit your GP if you have  symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) . \n The impact of OCD\u00a0on your day-to-day life can be reduced if the condition is diagnosed and effectively treated. \n Many people with OCD do not report their symptoms to their\u00a0GP because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. They may also try\u00a0to disguise their symptoms from family and friends. \n However, if you have OCD, you should not\u00a0feel ashamed or embarrassed. Like\u00a0 diabetes  or  asthma , OCD is a long-term health condition, and it is not your fault you have it. \n If you think a friend or family member may have OCD, it's a good idea to talk to them carefully\u00a0about your concerns and suggest they seek medical advice. \n Initial questions \n Your GP will probably ask you\u00a0a series of questions to\u00a0determine whether it's likely you have OCD. \n These may be similar to\u00a0the following: \n \n Do you wash or clean a lot? \n Do you check things a lot? \n Do you have thoughts that keep bothering you that you would like to get rid of but cannot? \n Do your daily activities take a long time to finish? \n Are you concerned about putting things in a special order or are you upset by mess? \n Do these problems trouble you? \n \n Assessment \n If the results of the initial screening questions suggest you have OCD, the severity of your symptoms will be assessed either by your GP or\u00a0a mental health professional. \n There are several different methods of assessment. All involve asking\u00a0detailed questions to find out how much of your day-to-day life is affected by obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behaviour. \n During the assessment, it is important\u00a0you are open and honest, as accurate and truthful responses will ensure you receive\u00a0the most appropriate treatment. \n OCD is classified into three levels of severity: \n \n mild functional impairment \u2013 obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviour that occupies less than one hour of your day \n moderate functional impairment \u2013 obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviour that occupies\u00a0one to three\u00a0hours of your day \n severe functional impairment \u2013 obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviour that occupies more than three hours of your day \n \n Healthcare professionals use the term \"functional impairment\" to\u00a0refer to the disruption of your daily activities."},

This can be caused by\u00a0a blow to the head, recent nasal surgery and\u00a0hardened arteries (atherosclerosis). \n Read more about the  causes of nosebleeds  \n Who gets nosebleeds? \n Nosebleeds are fairly common and most people will experience them every now and again. Anyone can get a nosebleed, but they most\u00a0often affect: \n \n children between two and 10 years of age \n elderly people \n pregnant women \n people who regularly take\u00a0 aspirin \u00a0or\u00a0anticoagulants, such as\u00a0warfarin \n people with blood clotting disorders, such as\u00a0haemophilia \n \n Bleeding may also be heavier or last longer if you take anticoagulants, have a blood clotting disorder, or have  high blood pressure (hypertension) . \n Are nosebleeds serious? \n Nosebleeds aren't usually serious. However, frequent or heavy nosebleeds may indicate more serious health problems, such as high blood pressure or a blood clotting disorder, and should be checked. \n Excessive bleeding over a prolonged period of time can also lead to\u00a0further problems such as  anaemia . \n If your GP suspects a more serious problem is causing your nosebleeds, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests. \n Preventing nosebleeds \n Things you\u00a0can do\u00a0to\u00a0prevent nosebleeds include: \n \n avoid picking your nose and keep your fingernails short \n blow your nose as little as possible and only very gently \n keep your home humidified \n regularly apply petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline) to the inside of your nostrils to keep the inside of your nose moist \n wear a head guard during activities in which your nose or head\u00a0could get injured \n always follow the instructions that come with nasal  decongestants \u00a0\u2013 overusing these can cause nosebleeds \n \n Talk to your GP if you experience nosebleeds frequently and aren't able to prevent them. They may refer you to an ENT specialist for an assessment.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Nosebleeds can be caused by a number of different things. It's not always possible to identify the exact reason why one occurs. \n Nosebleeds can start just inside your nostrils (anterior) or\u00a0at the back of\u00a0your nose (posterior). These different types of nosebleeds tend to have different causes. \n Anterior nosebleeds \n The vast majority of\u00a0nosebleeds are anterior nosebleeds, which means the bleeding comes from\u00a0the wall between the two nose channels (the lower septum), just inside your nose. This part of the nose, known as Little's area, contains many delicate blood vessels that can be easily damaged. \n The cause of anterior nosebleeds is sometimes unknown, but they can be caused by a number of things, including: \n \n picking your nose, particularly if you scratch the inside of your nose with a\u00a0sharp fingernail \n blowing your nose very hard \n a minor injury to your nose \n a blocked or stuffy nose often caused by an infection such as a\u00a0 cold  or\u00a0 flu  \n sinusitis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the small, air-filled cavities inside your cheekbones and forehead \n dry air or an increase in temperature drying out the inside of your nose \n  hay fever \u00a0or other  allergies  \n high altitude \n excessive use of nasal\u00a0 decongestants  \n a crooked nose that's either present from birth (congenital) or the result of an injury (a deviated septum) \n \n Anterior nosebleeds are more common in children and are not usually a sign of anything serious. They can often be treated easily at home. \n Read more about  treating nosebleeds  \n Posterior nosebleeds \n A small number of nosebleeds are posterior nosebleeds, which means the bleeding originates from branches of arteries that supply blood to the space inside your nose between the roof of your mouth and your brain (nasal cavity). \n These nosebleeds are\u00a0more common in adults than children. They can be more serious than anterior nosebleeds and bleed more heavily. Medical attention may be required. \n Causes of posterior nosebleeds include: \n \n a  blow to your head , or a  fall  \n a\u00a0broken nose \n recent nasal surgery \n hardened arteries (atherosclerosis) \n medicines\u00a0that cause you to bleed more easily, including  aspirin  and anticoagulants such as\u00a0warfarin and heparin \n a tumour in the nasal cavity \n a blood clotting abnormality\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0haemophilia or\u00a0von Willebrand disease \n hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an inherited genetic condition that affects the blood vessels \n  leukaemia \u00a0(although this is rare and you're likely to have other symptoms as well) \n \n  High blood pressure (hypertension)  is also more common in people with nosebleeds and may make it harder to stop the bleeding, but it's not clear whether this directly causes nosebleeds.", "treatment": "Most nosebleeds can be stopped without the need for medical attention, but occasionally further treatment may be required. \n What to do \n To stop a nosebleed: \n \n sit down and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10-15 minutes \n lean forward and breathe through your mouth\u00a0\u2013 this will drain blood down your nose instead of down the back of your throat \n place an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables covered by a towel on the bridge of your nose\u00a0 \n stay upright, rather than lying down as this reduces the blood pressure in the blood vessels of your nose and will discourage further bleeding \n \n If the bleeding eventually stops, you won't usually need to seek medical advice.

This may involve looking inside your nose, measuring your pulse and blood pressure, carrying out\u00a0 blood tests  and asking about any other symptoms you have. \n The two main treatments that your GP or hospital doctor may use to stop your nose bleeding are cautery and nasal packing. These are described below. \n Cautery \n If your doctor is able to identify exactly where the bleeding is coming from, they may carry out a minor procedure to seal the bleeding blood vessel by\u00a0cauterising (burning)\u00a0it. \n This is normally done using a stick of a chemical called silver nitrate. A  local anaesthetic  will be sprayed into your nose to numb it and the silver nitrate stick will be held against the bleeding point for up to 10 seconds. \n Nasal packing \n If cautery is ineffective or your doctor is unable to identify a specific bleeding point, they may recommend packing your nose with gauze or special nasal sponges to stop the flow of blood by applying pressure to the source of the bleeding. \n Packing will usually be carried out after\u00a0local anaesthetic has been sprayed into your nose. The\u00a0gauze or sponges\u00a0often need to be left in place for 24-48 hours before being removed by a health professional. You'll usually need to be admitted to hospital to be monitored during this time. \n Further treatment \n If the treatments above don't help, you may be referred to\u00a0a hospital specialist such as an ear, nose and throat (ENT)\u00a0doctor for further treatment. \n Additional treatments that may be used in hospital include: \n \n electrocautery \u2013\u00a0an electric current running through a wire is used to cauterise the blood vessel where the bleeding is coming from \n  blood transfusions \u00a0\u2013 a procedure to\u00a0replace the blood you've lost \n tranexamic acid \u2013 medication that can reduce bleeding by helping your blood to clot \n packing under anaesthetic \u2013\u00a0your nose is carefully\u00a0packed with gauze while you are unconscious from\u00a0 general anaesthetic  \n ligation \u2013 an operation\u00a0using\u00a0small instruments to tie off\u00a0bleeding blood vessels in the back of your nose \n \n Recovery \n Once your nose has stopped bleeding, you should follow the advice below to reduce the risk of your nose bleeding again and to stop you picking up an infection: \n \n avoid\u00a0blowing or picking your nose, heavy lifting, strenuous exercise, lying flat, and drinking alcohol or hot drinks for 24 hours \n don't remove any crusts that form inside your nose\u00a0\u2013 these may be unpleasant, but they're a useful part of the healing process \n if you need to sneeze, try to sneeze with your mouth open to reduce the pressure in your nose \n avoid people with coughs and colds \n \n If you see\u00a0a\u00a0GP or a\u00a0hospital doctor about your nosebleed, they\u00a0may give you a prescription for an antiseptic nasal cream once the bleeding stops. This should be applied to\u00a0the\u00a0inside of your\u00a0nostrils several times a day for up to two weeks to help prevent further bleeding. \n If your nose does start to bleed again, follow the first aid advice above and seek medical advice if the bleeding doesn't stop.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It's also called the \"winter vomiting bug\" because it's more common in winter, although you can catch it at any time of the year. \n Norovirus can be very unpleasant but it usually clears up by itself in a few days. \n You can normally look after yourself or your child at home. \n Try to avoid going to your GP, as norovirus can spread to others very easily. Call your GP or the\u00a0NHS 24 ' 111 ' service if you're concerned or need any advice. \n This page covers: \n  Symptoms of norovirus  \n  What to do if you have norovirus  \n  When to get medical advice  \n  How is norovirus spread?  \n  Preventing norovirus  \n Symptoms\u00a0of norovirus \n The symptoms of norovirus are very distinctive. \n You're\u00a0likely to have norovirus if you\u00a0experience: \n \n suddenly feeling sick \n projectile\u00a0vomiting \n watery\u00a0 diarrhoea  \n \n Some people also have a slight fever,  headaches , painful stomach cramps and aching limbs. \n The symptoms appear one to two days after you become infected and typically last for up to two or three days. \n What\u00a0to do if you have norovirus \n If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you're feeling better. There's no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. \n You don't usually need to get medical advice unless there's a risk of a more serious problem (see\u00a0 When to get medical advice ). \n To help ease your own or your child\u2019s symptoms: \n \n drink plenty of fluids to avoid  dehydration . You need to drink more than\u00a0usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea \u2013 as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. \n take\u00a0 paracetamol  for any fever or aches and pains. \n get plenty of rest. \n if you feel like eating, eat plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. \n use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a\u00a0 dry mouth  or dark urine \u2013 read more about\u00a0 treating dehydration . \n adults can take antidiarrhoeal and/or anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medication \u2013 these are not suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them. \n \n Babies and young children, especially if they're less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated. \n Norovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on. \n When to get medical advice \n You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there's no specific treatment for it.\u00a0 \n  Antibiotics  won't help because it's caused by a virus. \n Visiting your GP surgery with norovirus can put others at risk, so it's best to call your GP or the\u00a0NHS 24 ' 111 ' service if you're concerned or feel you need advice. \n Get medical advice if: \n \n your baby or child has passed six or more watery stools in the past 24 hours, or has vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours \n your baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin \n you or your child has  symptoms of severe dehydration , such as persistent\u00a0dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness \u2013 babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated \n you have bloody diarrhoea \n your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days \n you or your child have a serious underlying condition, such as  kidney disease , and have diarrhoea and vomiting \n \n Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your stool to a laboratory to confirm whether you have norovirus or another infection. \n How\u00a0is\u00a0norovirus spread? \n Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. \n You can catch it if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: \n \n close contact with someone with norovirus \u2013 they may breathe out small particles containing the virus that you could inhale \n touching contaminated surfaces or objects\u00a0\u2013 the virus can survive outside the body for several days \n eating contaminated food \u2013\u00a0this can happen\u00a0if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food \n \n A person with\u00a0norovirus is most infectious from when their symptoms start until\u00a048 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. \n You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing,\u00a0so your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it. \n Preventing\u00a0norovirus \n It's not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advice below can help stop the virus spreading. \n \n Stay off work or school\u00a0until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have\u00a0passed. You should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. \n Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they do not kill the virus. \n Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. \n Wash any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash to ensure the virus is killed. \n Don't share towels and flannels. \n Flush away any infected\u00a0poo or vomit in the toilet and clean\u00a0the surrounding area. \n Avoid eating raw, unwashed produce and only eat oysters from a reliable source, as oysters can carry norovirus.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. \n In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. \n The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. \n Read more about the  symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma .\u00a0 \n Who's affected? \n In the UK, more than 12,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year. \n Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over 65. Slightly more men than women are affected. \n What causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma? \n The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if: \n \n you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system \n you take immunosuppressant medication \n you've previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which causes  glandular fever  \n \n You also have a slightly increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had the condition. \n Read more about the  causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . \n How non-Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed \n The only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a  biopsy . \n This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory. \n Read more about  diagnosing non-Hodgkin lymphoma . \n Treatment and outlook \n There are many subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but they can generally be put into one of two broad categories: \n \n high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively \n low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u2013 where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years \n \n The outlook\u00a0for non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies greatly, depending on the exact type,\u00a0grade and extent of the lymphoma, and the person\u2019s age. \n Low-grade tumours don't necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured.\u00a0 \n The main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are: \n \n  chemotherapy  \n  radiotherapy \u00a0 \n a\u00a0type of targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy \n \n Overall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable. You can read more detailed information about\u00a0 the outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma  on the Cancer Research UK website. \n However, there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including  infertility  and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. \n Read more about:\u00a0 \n \n  treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma \u00a0 \n  complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma  \n \n Information about you \n If you have\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

These can include: \n \n night sweats \n unintentional weight loss\u00a0 \n a high temperature (fever) \n a persistent\u00a0 cough  or feeling of\u00a0 breathlessness  \n persistent itching of the skin all over the body \n \n Other symptoms depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are.

The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions, so the cells keep growing. This causes them to multiply uncontrollably. \n The abnormal\u00a0lymphocytes\u00a0usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it's possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your: \n \n bone marrow \n spleen \n liver \n skin \n lungs \n \n However, in some cases, non-Hodgkin lymphoma first develops in an organ or\u00a0somewhere else outside the lymphatic system (the network of lymph vessels and glands found throughout\u00a0the body). \n Who's most at risk? \n While the cause of the initial mutation that triggers non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: \n \n having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as  HIV  \n having medical treatment that weakens your immune system \u2013 for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after an organ transplant \n having an autoimmune condition (a condition caused by problems with the immune system), such as  rheumatoid arthritis ,  lupus  or  Sjogren's syndrome  \n being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 a common virus that causes  glandular fever  \n being previously exposed to the Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) \n having a Helicobacter pylori infection \u2013 a common bacterial infection that usually infects the lining of the stomach and small intestine \n having received  chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy  for an earlier cancer \n having\u00a0 coeliac disease  \u2013 an adverse reaction to gluten that causes inflammation of the small bowel \n \n Non-Hodgkin lymphoma isn't infectious and isn't thought to run in families, although your risk may be slightly increased if a first-degree relative (such as a parent or sibling) has had lymphoma. \n Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but most cases are diagnosed in people over 65. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.", "treatment": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is usually treated with cancer-killing medication or radiotherapy, although some people may not need treatment straight away. \n In a few cases,\u00a0if the initial cancer is\u00a0very small\u00a0and can be removed during\u00a0a\u00a0 biopsy , no further treatment may be needed. \n Your treatment plan \n The recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age,\u00a0as many of the treatments can put a\u00a0tremendous strain on the body. \n Discussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). \n Your MDT will recommend the best treatment options for you. However, you shouldn't be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner. \n You'll be invited back to see your care team for a full discussion about the risks and benefits of any treatments planned before treatment begins. \n You can ask your\u00a0care team\u00a0if a clinical trial\u00a0is available to take part in. \n The main treatment options for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are described below. \n Wait-and-see approach \n If the disease is low-grade (slow developing) and you're well, a period of \"watchful waiting\" is often recommended. This is because some people take many years to develop troublesome symptoms and starting treatment immediately is often felt to be unnecessary. \n If watchful waiting is recommended, you'll be seen regularly for reviews and invited to come back at any stage if you feel your symptoms are getting worse. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0is a widely used treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which involves\u00a0using medicine to kill cancer cells. It may be used on\u00a0its own, combined with biological therapy and/or combined with radiotherapy (see below). \n The medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on the stage of your cancer. \n If doctors think your cancer is curable, you'll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy).\u00a0If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms. \n If there's a risk of the cancer spreading to your brain, you may have chemotherapy injections directly into the cerebrospinal fluid around your spine. \n Chemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome, and a longer hospital stay may be needed. \n Chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems: \n \n fatigue \n  breathlessness  \n increased vulnerability to infection \n bleeding and bruising more easily \n \n If you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells. \n Other possible side effects of chemotherapy include: \n \n nausea and vomiting \n  diarrhoea  \n loss of appetite \n  mouth ulcers  \n tiredness \n skin rashes \n  hair loss  \n  infertility , which may be temporary or permanent (see  complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma  for more information) \n \n Most side effects should pass once your treatment has finished. Tell your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments that can help. \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy . \n High-dose chemotherapy \n If non-Hodgkin lymphoma doesn't get better with initial treatment (known as \"refractory\" lymphoma), you may have a course of chemotherapy at a stronger dose. \n However, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You'll need a stem cell or\u00a0bone marrow transplants to replace the damaged bone marrow. \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy  is\u00a0most\u00a0often\u00a0used to treat early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body. \n Treatment is normally given in short daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You should not have to stay in hospital between appointments. \n Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary, depending on which part of your body is being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss. \n Other common side effects include: \n \n sore and red skin in the treatment area \n tiredness \n nausea and vomiting \n dry mouth \n loss of appetite \n \n Most side effects are temporary, but there's a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area. \n Read more about: \n \n  side effects of radiotherapy  \n  complications of non-Hodgkin lymphoma  \n \n Monoclonal antibody\u00a0therapy \n For some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody. \n These medications attach themselves\u00a0to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulate the immune system to attack and kill the cells. They're often given in combination with chemotherapy to make the treatment more effective. \n For some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, you may continue having monoclonal antibody treatment regularly for up to two years after initial treatment, in combination with\u00a0chemotherapy. This can reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future. \n One of the main\u00a0monoclonal antibody medications used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma is called rituximab.\u00a0This medication\u00a0is administered directly into your vein over the course of a few hours. \n Side effects of rituximab can include: \n \n  flu -like symptoms, such as a\u00a0 headaches , fever and chills \n tiredness \n nausea \n an itchy rash \n \n You may be given additional medication to prevent or lessen these side effects. Side effects should improve over time, as your body gets used to rituximab. \n As\u00a0rituximab has been so successful in treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma, scientists are working hard to make more monoclonal antibody treatments for lymphoma, and some of these are already at an advanced stage in clinical trials. You may be asked if you want to participate in one of these trials during your treatment. \n Steroid medication \n  Steroid medication  is commonly\u00a0used in combination with chemotherapy to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is because research has shown that using steroids makes the chemotherapy more effective. \n The steroid medication is normally\u00a0given as tablets, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. A short course of steroids, lasting no more than a few months, is usually recommended, as this limits the number of side effects you could have. \n Common side effects of short-term steroid use include: \n \n increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain \n  indigestion  \n problems sleeping \n feeling agitated \n \n On rare occasions, you may have to take steroids on a long-term basis. Side effects of long-term steroid use include weight gain and swelling in your hands, feet and eyelids. \n The side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes. \n Follow-up \n After your course of treatment ends, you may have a repeat scan to see how well the treatment has worked. Following this, you'll need regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning (known as a \"relapse\"). \n These appointments will start off being every few weeks or months, but become less frequent over time. \n Want to know more? \n For more information, see: \n \n  Cancer Research UK: treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma  \n  Cancer Research UK: living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma  \n  Macmillan: treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma  \n  Macmillan: living with non-Hodgkin lymphoma", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you see your GP because you're concerned about symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, they'll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination. \n If necessary, your GP will refer you to hospital for further tests. \n In 2015, the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster. \n To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma, read the  NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n If you're referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. \n Biopsy \n A  biopsy  involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory. \n Biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a  local anaesthetic \u00a0(where the area is numbed). In some cases,\u00a0the affected lymph node isn't easily accessible and a  general anaesthetic  may be required (where you're asleep). \n A pathologist (an expert in the study of diseased tissue) will then check the tissue sample for the presence of cancerous cells. If they find cancerous cells, they can also identify exactly which type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma you have, which is an important factor in planning your treatment. \n Types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma \n There are more than 30 types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including: \n \n diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \n follicular lymphoma \n extranodal marginal zone B-cell (MALT) \n mantle cell lymphoma \n Burkitt lymphoma \n mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma \n nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma \n small lymphocytic lymphoma \n lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\u00a0 \n peripheral T-cell lymphoma \n skin (cutaneous) lymphomas \n anaplastic large-cell lymphoma \n lymphoblastic lymphoma \n \n The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more detailed information on the  different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . \n Further testing \n If a biopsy confirms a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, further testing will be required to check how far the lymphoma has spread. This allows a doctor to diagnose the stage of your lymphoma (see below). \n Further tests may include: \n \n  blood tests  \u2013 samples of blood will be taken throughout your diagnosis and treatment to check your general health, the levels of red and white cells and platelets in your blood, and how well organs such as your liver and kidney are working \n bone marrow sample \u2013 another biopsy may be carried out to see if the lymphoma has spread to your bone marrow; this involves using a long needle to remove a sample of bone marrow from your pelvis and can be done using a local anaesthetic \n chest  X-ray  \u2013 this can check whether\u00a0the cancer\u00a0has spread to your chest or lungs \n  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \u2013 this scan takes a series of X-rays that build up a 3D picture of the inside of the body to check the spread of\u00a0the cancer\u00a0 \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013 this scan uses strong magnetic fields to build up a detailed picture of areas of your body to check the spread of the cancer \n  positron emission tomography (PET) scan  \u2013\u00a0this scan measures the activity of cells in different parts of the body and\u00a0can check the spread of the cancer and the impact of treatment; it's usually taken at the same time as a CT scan to show precisely how the tissues of different sites of the body are working \n lumbar puncture\u00a0\u2013 using a thin needle, a sample of spinal fluid is taken and examined to see if it contains any lymphoma cells \n \n Stages of\u00a0non-Hodgkin lymphoma \n When the testing is complete, it should be possible to determine the stage of your lymphoma. \"Staging\" means scoring the cancer by how far it's spread. \n The main stages of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are. \n \n \n stage 1\u00a0\u2013 the cancer is limited to one group of lymph nodes, such as your neck or groin nodes either above or below your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle underneath the lungs) \n stage 2 \u2013 two or more lymph node groups are affected, either above or below\u00a0the diaphragm \n stage 3\u00a0\u2013 the\u00a0cancer has spread to lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm \n stage 4\u00a0\u2013 the lymphoma has spread through the lymphatic system and is now present in organs or bone marrow \n \n Health professionals also add the letter \"A\" or \"B\" to your stage to indicate whether or not you have certain symptoms. \n \"A\" is put after your stage if you have no additional symptoms other than swollen lymph nodes. \"B\" is put after your stage if you have additional symptoms of weight loss, fever or night sweats. \n In some cases, health professionals also use additional letters to indicate where the cancer first developed. For example, \"E\" (extranodal) means the cancer developed outside the lymphatic system. \n Grading non-Hodgkin lymphoma \n Testing can also help health professionals decide the \"grade\" of the cancer. There are two main grades of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: \n \n low-grade or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops slowly, and you may not experience any symptoms for many years \n high-grade or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma is where the cancer develops quickly and aggressively \n \n Low-grade tumours don't necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated immediately, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured. \n In some cases, low-grade lymphomas can develop into high-grade lymphomas over time. \n Read more about  treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)", "introduction": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. \n A healthy liver should contain little or no fat. It's estimated that up to one in every three people in the UK has early stages of NAFLD where there are small amounts of fat in their liver. \n Early-stage NAFLD doesn't usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including\u00a0 cirrhosis , if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of problems such as  diabetes ,\u00a0 heart attacks  and\u00a0 strokes . \n If detected and managed at an early stage, it's possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. \n This page covers: \n  Stages of NAFLD  \n  Am I at risk of NAFLD?  \n  Symptoms of\u00a0NAFLD  \n  How NAFLD is diagnosed  \n  Treatment for NAFLD  \n Stages of NAFLD \n NAFLD develops in 4\u00a0main stages. \n Most people will only ever\u00a0develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In small number of cases it\u00a0can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. \n The main stages of NAFLD are: \n \n simple fatty liver (steatosis) \u2013 a largely harmless build-up of fat in the liver cells that may only be diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason \n non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)\u2013 a more serious form of NAFLD, where the liver has become inflamed; this is estimated to affect up to 5% of the UK population \n fibrosis \u2013 where persistent inflammation\u00a0causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby\u00a0blood\u00a0vessels, but the liver is still able to function normally \n  cirrhosis \u00a0\u2013 the most severe stage, occurring after\u00a0years of inflammation, where the liver shrinks and becomes scarred and lumpy; this damage is permanent and can\u00a0lead to\u00a0liver failure (where your liver stops working properly) and\u00a0 liver cancer  \n \n It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis\u00a0to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to\u00a0prevent the disease from getting worse. \n Am I at risk of NAFLD? \n You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you: \n \n are\u00a0 obese  or overweight\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you have a lot of fat around your waist (an \"apple-like\" body shape) \n have\u00a0 type 2 diabetes  \n have\u00a0 high blood pressure  \n have\u00a0 high cholesterol  \n are over the age of 50 \n smoke \n \n However, NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. \n Although it's very similar to  alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) , NAFLD isn't caused by drinking too much alcohol. \n Symptoms of\u00a0NAFLD \n There aren't usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won't know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason. \n Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience: \n \n a dull or aching pain in the top right of the\u00a0tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs) \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n unexplained weight loss \n weakness \n \n If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet\u00a0or tummy. \n Read more about the  symptoms of cirrhosis . \n How NAFLD is diagnosed \n NAFLD is often diagnosed after\u00a0a  blood test \u00a0called a\u00a0liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don't always pick up NAFLD. \n The condition may also be spotted during an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body. \n If you're diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue ( biopsy ) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory. \n Treatment for NAFLD \n Most people with NAFLD won't develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse. \n There's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications. \n You may be advised to have regular appointments with your\u00a0doctor to check your liver function and\u00a0look for signs of any new problems. \n Healthy diet and lifestyle \n Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD.\u00a0The following can all\u00a0help:\u00a0 \n \n  Lose weight  \u2013 you should aim for a\u00a0 BMI  of 18.5-24.9. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it. \n  Eat a healthy diet  \u2013 try to have a\u00a0balanced diet\u00a0high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too. \n  Exercise\u00a0regularly  \u2013 aim to do at least 150 minutes of\u00a0moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don't lose weight. \n  Stop smoking \u00a0\u2013 if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes. \n \n NAFLD isn't caused by alcohol, but\u00a0drinking may make the condition worse. It's therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some  tips on cutting down on alcohol . \n Medication \n There isn't currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but\u00a0various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition. \n For example, your doctor may recommend medication to  treat high blood pressure ,  treat high cholesterol ,  treat type 2 diabetes \u00a0and/or  treat obesity . \n Liver transplant \n If you develop\u00a0severe cirrhosis and your\u00a0liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant. \n For adults,\u00a0the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors. \n Alternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using\u00a0a section of liver\u00a0removed from a living donor. As\u00a0the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow to a normal size. \n Read more about\u00a0 liver transplants .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Children", "introduction": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. About 80 children of all ages develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the UK each year. It is more common in boys than girls. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming and there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information. If you have any questions it\u2019s important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) \n The lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body\u2019s natural defence against infection and disease. This is a complex system made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes throughout the body. The lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels. \n Lymph nodes are also known as lymph glands, and the ones that you\u2019re most likely to notice are those in the neck, armpit and groin. \n The number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another; in some parts there are very few, whereas under your arm there may be 20-50 nodes. \n Cancers that start in the lymphatic system are called lymphomas. There are two main types of lymphoma: \n \n  Hodgkin lymphoma \u00a0 \n non-Hodgkin lymphoma \n \n Although they\u2019re both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment. \n There are two main types of NHL. B-cell NHL usually involves the lymph nodes in the abdomen and intestines, but may involve nodes in the head and neck. T-cell NHL usually affects lymph nodes in the chest. \n Occasionally, NHL can develop in unusual places outside the lymph nodes. This is called extranodal lymphoma. \n Causes of NHL \n We don\u2019t know what causes NHL but there is research going on all the time to try to find out. It is important to remember that nothing you have done has caused the cancer. \n Signs and symptoms \n The first sign of NHL is usually a lump somewhere in the body, which is caused by swollen lymph nodes. This can cause different symptoms, depending on where the swollen lymph nodes are. If glands in the abdomen are affected, this may cause a feeling of being full after meals and some stomach pain. Other symptoms of NHL include a high temperature (fever), tiredness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In a few children, lymphoma cells may be found in the bone marrow or in the fluid around the spinal cord(cerebrospinal fluid). \n How it is diagnosed \n A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose NHL. Part, or all, of a swollen lymph gland may be removed so that the cells can be examined in the laboratory (biopsy). This involves a small operation that is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Tests such as X-rays, ultrasound scans, MRI scans, CT scans, blood tests and bone marrow samples may be carried out to find out the extent of the disease. This is known as staging. \n Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you.\u00a0The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve. \n Staging \n The stage of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. The type of treatment your child receives depends on the stage of the disease. A simplified version of the stages of NHL is below: \n  Stage 1  \n One group of lymph nodes is affected, or there\u2019s a single extranodal tumour. \n  Stage 2  \n Two or more groups of nodes are affected, or there is a single extranodal tumour that has spread to nearby lymph nodes; or there are two single extranodal tumours, but only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs, which plays a large part in our breathing). \n  Stage 3  \n There\u2019s lymphoma on both sides of the diaphragm (either in two or more groups of nodes) or there are two single extranodal tumours or the lymphoma is affecting the chest. \n  Stage 4  \n The lymphoma has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other organs of the body such as the bone marrow or nervous system. \n Treatment \n Treatment for NHL has a very good success rate and many people are cured.  Chemotherapy  is the most important treatment for children with NHL. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. \n It is common for a combination of drugs to be used and treatment may last a number of months or years. The treatment will be planned according to your child\u2019s particular type of NHL and the stage of the disease. B-cell NHL is treated with 4\u20138 courses of intensive chemotherapy. T-cell NHL is treated for about two years. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you. \n NHL can sometimes affect the brain and spinal cord. To stop this, chemotherapy may be injected directly into the fluid around the spinal cord. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy. \n Very rarely,  radiotherapy  is also necessary. Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. \n High-dose chemotherapy with a bone marrow transplant is sometimes used (again very rarely) if the NHL comes back (recurs) after initial treatment. \n Side effects of treatment \n Treatment for NHL can cause different side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the part of the body that\u2019s being treated and what treatment is being used. Some children have just a few side effects, while others experience more. \n Side effects can include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting \n a sore mouth \n temporary  hair loss  \n a low blood count leading to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding (sometimes blood and/or platelet transfusions are needed) \n  tiredness  \n  diarrhoea  \n \n Late side effects \n Months or years later some children will develop late side effects from the treatment they have had. These include a possible reduction in bone growth, a change in the way the heart, lungs and kidneys work, and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. \n After treatment with chemotherapy, some children - particularly boys - may become infertile. Older boys, and their parents, should be aware of the option of sperm banking. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years. \n Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects and will keep a close eye on possible long-term side effects in follow-up clinics. We have more detailed information about these late side effects. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Cancer research trials are carried out \n to try to find new and better treatments for cancer. Clinical trials mean there are now better results for curing children\u2019s cancers compared with just a few years ago. Your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Once treatment has finished, the doctors will monitor your child closely with regular appointments in the hospital outpatient department. \n Over 80% of the children who get NHL recover completely. The chances of successful treatment depend on the specific type, stage and grade of lymphoma. Your child\u2019s doctor can discuss these details with you. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Neuroendocrine tumours", "introduction": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare tumours that can occur in the cells of the neuroendocrine system. \n The neuroendocrine system consists of nerve and gland cells. It produces hormones and releases them into the bloodstream. \n NETs are tumours (abnormal growths) that develop in the cells of the neuroendocrine system. \n NETs can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) and often\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but not always\u00a0\u2013 grow slowly. There are a number of different types of NET, depending on the specific cells affected. \n Types of neuroendocrine tumours \n Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) are tumours that develop in the gut or pancreas. \n Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs) develop in the digestive system, which includes the bowel, stomach or oesophagus. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) develop in the pancreas. \n Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumours develop in the lungs. Rarely, NETs can also develop in other parts of the body, including in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, kidneys, ovaries, or testicles. \n Some NETs, known as functioning tumours, produce hormones that cause specific symptoms. Tumours that don't cause symptoms are known as non-functioning tumours. \n Symptoms of neuroendocrine tumours \n The symptoms of\u00a0a\u00a0neuroendocrine tumour\u00a0can vary depending on where it is and what hormones it produces. \n For example,\u00a0a\u00a0tumour in the digestive system may cause  diarrhoea ,\u00a0 constipation \u00a0or tummy pains. A tumour in the lung may cause wheezing or a persistent  cough . \n Some tumours (functioning tumours) may cause abnormally large amounts of hormones to be released into the bloodstream. \n This can\u00a0cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, flushing, cramps, wheezing,\u00a0 low blood sugar  (hypoglycaemia), changes in blood pressure and heart problems. \n What causes\u00a0neuroendocrine tumours? \n What causes neuroendocrine tumours isn't fully understood. However,\u00a0your chance of developing an NET is increased\u00a0if you have one of the following rare conditions or syndromes: \n \n multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) \u2013\u00a0a rare inherited condition where tumours in the endocrine system develop, most commonly in the parathyroid glands, pituitary gland and the pancreas \n neurofibrmatosis type 1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a group of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along your nerves \n Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) \u2013 an inherited condition that causes blood vessels to grow abnormally \n \n Research has also shown that your risk of developing an NET is slightly increased if one of your parents has had one in the past. \n Diagnosing\u00a0neuroendocrine tumours \n There are many tests that can\u00a0be used to diagnose NETs, including  blood tests , urine tests, scans, and a  biopsy  (where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination). \n Different types of scans may also be used to identify or examine tumours. These include: \n \n  ultrasound scans \u00a0\u2013 including echocardiograms and endoscopic ultrasound scans \n  computerised tomography (CT) scans  \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  \n  positron emission tomography (PET) scans  \n octreotide scans\u00a0\u2013 where mild radioactive liquid is injected into your veins and\u00a0a special camera is used to highlight\u00a0any cancerous cells \n \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about  tests for rare cancers .\u00a0 \n Treating neuroendocrine tumours \n How a neuroendocrine tumour is treated will depend on your\u00a0individual circumstances. For example, your treatment will depend on: \n \n where the tumour is \n how advanced your condition is \n your overall\u00a0health \n \n Unfortunately, many people are only diagnosed after other parts of their body are affected. However, it may still be possible to\u00a0surgically remove the tumour, even if it has spread to other parts of your body. \n If surgery can't be used to completely cure your condition, it may be used to help manage and reduce any symptoms that you have. \n It may also be possible to shrink the tumour or stop further growth using treatments that block the blood supply to the tumour (embolisation),\u00a0or  chemotherapy ,  radiotherapy \u00a0or radiofrequency ablation (where heat is used to destroy the cells). \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about  neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) . \n Information about you \n If you have\u00a0neuroendocrine tumours, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Neuroblastoma: Children", "introduction": "Fewer than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year with neuroblastoma. Most children who have this cancer are younger than five years old. Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumour in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children\u2019s cancers. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Neuroblastoma \n Neuroblastoma develops from the cells left behind from a baby\u2019s development in the womb. The cells that it develops from are called neuroblasts. \n \n \u2018Neuro\u2019 means nerve \n \u2018Blast\u2019 means cells in early development \n \u2018Oma\u2019 means a group of cells, or a tumour \n \n Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body. The site of origin is either in one of the two adrenal glands situated in the abdomen (tummy) or in nerve tissue that runs alongside the spinal cord, in the neck, chest, abdomen or pelvis. The adrenal glands are specialised glands that are found above the right and left kidney. The adrenal glands normally release hormones to maintain blood pressure, and enable us to respond to stress. In some cases, neuroblastoma can spread to tissues beyond the original site such as the bone marrow, bone, lymph nodes, liver, and skin. \n Causes \n As with most cancers, the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. It is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people. \n Signs and symptoms \n The symptoms vary, depending on where your child\u2019s neuroblastoma tumour is. \n \n If the tumour is in the abdomen, your child\u2019s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine \n If the tumour affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing \n If the tumour occurs in the neck, it\u2019s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing \n Occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-coloured lumps \n If the tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily. If your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements. They may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine. \n Your child may be found to have high blood pressure \n Very rarely, children may have jerky eye and muscle movements, and general unsteadiness associated with the neuroblastoma \n \n There are often vague and non-specific associated symptoms of tiredness, pallor, loss of appetite, weight loss, bone pain and generalised discomfort. \n How is neuroblastoma diagnosed? \n A variety of tests and investigations will be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. These include a biopsy of the tumour, blood and bone marrow tests, X-rays, CT or MRI scans, and a special nuclear medicine scan called an MIBG scan (see below). These tests are carried out to confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, and to find the exact position of the original site of neuroblastoma within the body and to see whether it has spread. This process is known as staging. \n A specific type of urine test will also be done. Nearly all children with neuroblastoma (9 out of 10) will have substances called vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), or homovanillic acid (HVA), in their urine. Measuring the VMA and HVA in the urine can help to confirm the diagnosis. Your child will also have their VMA and HVA levels checked during and after treatment. The levels of these substances will fall if the treatment is working. As these chemicals are produced by the tumour cells, and can be used to measure tumour activity, they are sometimes known as tumour markers. \n Most children will have an MIBG (meta-iodo-benzyl guanidine) scan. MIBG is a substance that\u2019s taken up by neuroblastoma cells. It\u2019s given by injection into the blood stream. Attaching a small amount of radioactive iodine to the MIBG enables any neuroblastoma tissue to be seen by a radiation scanner. Sometimes MIBG can be used as a treatment. \n  Biopsy  \n A small sample of cells (a  biopsy ) is usually taken from the tumour during an operation under a general anaesthetic. These cells are then examined under a microscope. Other tests collectively referred to as tumour biology, look at the chromosomes and \u2018biological markers\u2019 in the tumour cells. One of these \u2018markers\u2019 is called MYCN. The presence of a certain amount of MYCN in the cells (known as MYCN amplification) can suggest that the neuroblastoma may be a more aggressive type. In this situation, the treatment needs to be more intensive. \n Staging \n The \u2018stage\u2019 of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread beyond its original site. Knowing the particular type and stage of the cancer helps the doctors to decide on the best treatment for your child. \n A commonly-used staging system for neuroblastoma is described below: \n  Stage 1  \n The cancer is contained within one area of the body (localised) and there\u2019s no evidence of it having spread. It can be completely removed by surgery, or there may be very small (microscopic) amounts of tumour left. \n  Stage 2A  \n The cancer is localised and has not begun to spread, but cannot be completely removed by surgery. \n  Stage 2B  \n The cancer is localised and has begun to spread into nearby lymph nodes. \n  Stage 3  \n The cancer has spread into surrounding organs and structures, but has not spread to distant areas of the body. \n  Stage 4  \n The cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, liver, skin or other organs. \n  Stage 4S (also called special neuroblastoma)  \n This stage of neuroblastoma is found in children under one year old. The cancer is localised (as in stage 1, 2A or 2B) and has begun to spread to the liver, skin or bone marrow. \n A newer staging system has been developed by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG). This system (described below) is now widely used. It looks at whether or not certain \u2018image-defined risk factors\u2019 are present in a neuroblastoma tumour before treatment. These risk factors can be detected by scans and help doctors understand the extent of the disease. Your doctor can explain more about this. \n  Stage L1  \n The tumour is localised and has not spread into important areas (vital structures) nearby. It can be removed by surgery. \n  Stage L2  \n The tumour is localised but has \u2018image-defined risk factors\u2019 and can\u2019t be safely removed by surgery. \n  Stage M  \n The tumour has spread to other parts of the body. \n  Stage MS  \n The tumour has spread to the skin, liver and/or the bone marrow in children younger than 18 months old. \n If the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, this is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as recurrent or relapsed cancer. \n Treatment \n The treatment of neuroblastoma depends on the age of the child, the size and position of the tumour, the tumour biology (including the MYCN status) and whether the neuroblastoma has spread. \n  Surgery  \n For tumours that have not spread (localised tumours), the treatment is usually surgery. If the tumour is at an early stage and there is no evidence that it has spread to the lymph nodes or any other parts of the body, an operation to remove the tumour, or as much of it as possible, will be undertaken. If the tumour is, at first, too large or in too difficult a position to remove safely, chemotherapy will be given to shrink it before surgery. A cure is usually possible for children with localised tumours. However, if a localised tumour is classed as \u2018high-risk\u2019, due to the tumour biology results, additional treatment with chemotherapy and usually radiotherapy will be needed. \n  Chemotherapy  \n If the tumour has already spread by the time of diagnosis, or is indicated as being high-risk by the tumour biology result, intensive  chemotherapy  is needed. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells. It is usually given as an infusion into a vein. Your child will have a semi-permanent cannula called a central venous line inserted under a general anaesthetic to minimise the distress caused by intravenous injections. \n Your child\u2019s specialist will discuss with you the type and amount of chemotherapy needed. \n  High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue  \n If the neuroblastoma has spread to several parts of the body, or is high-risk with MYCN amplification, high dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell rescue is used after the initial courses of chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy will wipe out any remaining neuroblastoma cells but will also wipe out the body\u2019s bone marrow, where blood cells are made. To prevent the problems this causes, stem cells (blood cells at their earliest stages of development) are collected from your child through a drip before the chemotherapy is given. These stem cells are then frozen and stored until required. After the high-dose chemotherapy, the stem cells are given back to your child through a drip. They make their way into the bone marrow, where they grow and develop into mature blood cells over a period of 14\u201321 days. \n  Monoclonal antibody treatment  \n Monocolonal antibodies can destroy some types of cancer cells while causing little harm to normal cells. In the UK, patients with High Risk Neuroblastoma treated in the (SIOPEN) European High Risk Clinical Trial receive immunotherapy with a monoclonal antibody called anti-GD2 after their high dose therapy. There is good evidence from a clinical trial (research study) carried out in America, which was first reported on in 2009, that this may be a promising therapy when given alongside standard treatment for neuroblastoma. The anti GD2 is either given on its own or with cytokines. It is not yet a standard treatment for patients with neuroblastoma as it has very unpleasant side effects, the benefits need to be fully proven and the best way to administer it needs to be established. It is therefore currently only available to patients in the UK who are being treated within a clinical trial. Your child\u2019s specialist will be able to tell you much more about this treatment. \n  Radiotherapy  \n External beam  radiotherapy  may be given if the neuroblastoma is high-risk, or has spread to several parts of the body. This uses high-energy rays to destroy the cancer cells, while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. External beam radiotherapy is given from a machine outside the body. Internal radiotherapy may sometimes be given using radioactive MIBG. Radioactive MIBG is similar to the MIBG used in an investigation to diagnose a neuroblastoma, but uses higher doses of radioactivity to kill the cancer cells. \n  Younger children  \n Children under 18 months old with neuroblastoma often have \u2018low-risk\u2019 tumours, and as long as there is no MYCN amplification, their outlook is excellent. Most children in this age group are cured. \n Children with Stage 4S disease almost always get better with very little treatment or none at all. These tumours either regress spontaneously or after chemotherapy, which is only given if there are symptoms from the tumour. They disappear completely or develop into a non-cancerous (benign) tumour, called a ganglioneuroma. Many of these children, after their initial diagnostic tests and staging investigations, will just need careful monitoring for some years. Ganglioneuromas are usually harmless and will not cause any problems and do not need any treatment. \n Side effects of chemotherapy treatment \n Chemotherapy often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. The side effects will depend upon the actual drugs being given. Immediate side effects can include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n  diarrhoea  \n weight loss \n  hair loss  \n increased risk of infection \n bruising and bleeding \n tiredness \n \n Late side effects \n A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years after treatment. These include a change in the way the heart and kidneys work, hearing problems, fertility problems, a possible reduction in bone growth if radiotherapy has been given, and a slightly increased risk of developing another cancer in later life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors organise many trials for children\u2019s cancer. Children in the UK with neuroblastoma can take part in national and European studies. The European research group is called SIOPEN. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Follow-up after treatment usually involves regular visits to the hospital outpatients department, with scans and urine tests as necessary. For children who have had chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, more specialised tests \u2013 for example, hearing tests, kidney and heart function tests, and checking hormone levels \u2013 may also be carried out. These will be repeated until your child is grown up. If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows their situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Neuroblastoma", "introduction": "Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer that mostly affects young children. It develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts. \n These cells are found in a chain running down the back of the chest and stomach (abdomen). \n In many cases, neuroblastoma first develops in the adrenal glands (the two small glands above the kidneys) and can spread to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin. \n Neuroblastoma affects around 100 children each year in the UK. It usually affects children under the age of five, and can even occur before a child is born. \n The cause is unknown. There are very rare cases where children in the same family are affected, but it does not generally run in families. \n Signs and symptoms \n The symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread. \n It's often hard to diagnose neuroblastoma in the early stages, as initial symptoms are common ones \u2013 for example, aches and pains, loss of energy and loss of appetite. \n A relatively late sign is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, as this is where the cancer commonly starts. This is easy to miss in a young child. This lump can cause\u00a0 constipation  and difficulty passing urine, as well as general pain and discomfort. \n Other signs can include: \n \n a lump in the neck \n bone pain and difficulty walking, if the bones are affected \n numbness, weakness or loss of movement in the child\u2019s lower body, if the cancer has affected the spinal cord \n pale skin, bruising, bleeding and frequent infections, if the cancer has affected the bone marrow \n bluish lumps in the skin and the appearance of \"black eyes\" \n \n Diagnosing neuroblastoma \n A number of tests may be carried out if it's thought your child may have neuroblastoma. \n These tests may include: \n \n urine analysis tests to check for certain chemicals\u00a0found in the urine that are produced by neuroblastoma cells \n scans of various parts of the body to look for areas affected by the cancer \u2013 such as  ultrasound scans ,  computerised tomography (CT) scans  and  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  \n a special type of scan involving an injection of a substance that is taken up by neuroblastoma cells anywhere in the body,\u00a0called an mIBG scan \n a\u00a0 biopsy  (removal of a tissue sample for microscopic examination) will allow the cancer to be identified \u2013 the sample is typically removed under\u00a0 general anaesthesic  using a special needle \n \n If the lump is in one place and safe to remove with surgery, however,\u00a0then a preliminary biopsy is not necessary. \n Once these tests have been completed, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of neuroblastoma and what \"stage\" it is at (see below). \n Stages of neuroblastoma \n As with most cancers, neuroblastoma is defined by stages that reflect the condition's spread. There are many staging systems, but the most widely used until recently is shown first, with the more recently agreed stages in brackets: \n \n Stages 1 and 2 (L1) \u2013 the cancer is in one site and has not spread \n Stage 3 (L2) \u2013 the cancer has spread to local structures, but not to distant parts of the body \n Stage 4 (M) \u2013 the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body \n Stage 4s (Ms) \u2013 this special stage is for tumours diagnosed in babies under the age of 12 months; although it may have spread to other parts of the body, the outlook is fairly good, because it can get better on its own \n \n Treatment and outlook \n The outlook for neuroblastoma is generally better if the child is younger and the\u00a0cancer is confined to one site. \n Babies with Stage 4s neuroblastoma who have no symptoms may not need treatment, as the cancer may go away on its own. \n Depending on the stage,\u00a0 chemotherapy  is usually given to shrink the tumour before it is surgically removed, followed\u00a0in some cases by\u00a0 radiotherapy  to kill any remaining cancer cells. \n Almost half of neuroblastoma cases are an aggressive form and, despite very intensive treatment, the cancer may return. In these cases, further treatment will often be necessary.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Nasopharyngeal cancer", "introduction": "Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the part of the throat connecting the back of the nose to the back of the mouth (the pharynx). \n In the UK, only about 240 people are diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer each year. \n Nasopharyngeal cancer shouldn't be confused with other types of cancer that also affect the throat, such as  laryngeal cancer  and  oesophageal cancer . \n Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer \n It's often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage. \n Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include: \n \n a\u00a0lump in the neck \n  hearing loss \u00a0\u2013 usually only in one ear \n  tinnitus \u00a0\u2013 hearing sounds that come\u00a0from inside the body rather than from an outside source \n a blocked or stuffy nose \n  nosebleeds  \n \n See your GP if you develop any worrying symptoms, particularly if they don't improve after\u00a0a few weeks. While they're very unlikely to be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, it's best to get them checked out. \n What causes nasopharyngeal cancer? \n The exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but\u00a0a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: \n \n being of south Chinese or north African descent \n having a diet very high in salt-cured meats and fish \n being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus that causes  glandular fever  \n having a job where you're regularly exposed to hardwood dust \n having a first-degree relative, such as a parent, who's had the condition \n \n Being exposed to the\u00a0human papilloma virus (HPV)\u00a0may also increase your risk of developing certain types of nasopharyngeal cancer. \n About three times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer, and the average age at diagnosis is about 50. \n Diagnosing nasopharyngeal cancer \n If you see your GP with symptoms that could indicate nasopharyngeal cancer, they'll usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light. \n If your GP thinks further tests are necessary, they'll refer you to hospital. At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions. \n Some of the tests you may have include: \n \n a nasendoscopy \u2013\u00a0where a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope)\u00a0is inserted up your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; it's carried out while you're awake, but  local anaesthetic  can be used to numb your nose and throat \n imaging scans \u2013\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  or  computerised tomography (CT) scans  can be used to check for tumours and determine whether the cancer has spread \n a panendoscopy \u2013\u00a0a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under  general anaesthetic  (where you're unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together \n a  biopsy  \u2013\u00a0where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory \n \n Once these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer. They'll also be able to \"stage\" the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread. \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer   . \n How nasopharyngeal cancer is treated \n If you're diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you'll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together called a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case. \n The two main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are: \n \n radiotherapy \u2013 where\u00a0radiation\u00a0is used to kill cancer cells \n chemotherapy \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells \n \n In most cases, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be used. \n Surgery isn't usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer as it's difficult for surgeons to access the affected area. \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers. \n In most cases, external radiotherapy is used. This involves using a machine to focus high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment. \n In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used. \n It\u00a0involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This helps maximise the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue. \n Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned. \n External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to seven weeks. You won't need to stay in hospital overnight between\u00a0these appointments. \n In some cases, internal radiotherapy may be required\u00a0where nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment. A radioactive source is placed into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. \n Depending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time. \n Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as: \n \n red and sore\u00a0skin in the treatment area \n feeling sick \n changes to your sense of taste \n  dry mouth \u00a0 \n hair loss \n \n These side effects are usually temporary, but some can be permanent. Let your care team know if you experience these problems as treatment is often available to help. \n Read more about  how radiotherapy is performed  and the  side effects of radiotherapy  \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy  may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers. \n It's usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every three to four weeks spread over several months. You won't usually need to stay in hospital\u00a0overnight\u00a0during treatment. \n Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as: \n \n feeling sick \n  diarrhoea  \n sore mouth \n tiredness \n \n These side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility.\u00a0You should discuss any concerns you have about the potential side effects of treatment with your care team before treatment begins. \n Read more about  how chemotherapy is performed  and the  side effects of chemotherapy  \n Follow-up \n After your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments and scans to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning. \n To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll become gradually less frequent over time. \n Outlook \n The outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer depends on your age, general health and\u00a0how advanced the condition is when you're diagnosed. \n Radiotherapy alone can cure many very early-stage nasopharyngeal cancers, but many cases are diagnosed at a more advanced stage as the condition\u00a0doesn't always cause obvious symptoms until later on. \n More advanced cancers are treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. They're often curable if the cancer hasn't spread beyond the head and neck region. \n Overall, about 50 out of every 100 people (50%) diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer will live for five years or more after diagnosis. \n Survival rates are better for younger people, but worse for older people. Around 70 out of 100 (70%) people under 45 years of age, and 35 out of 100 (35%) people aged 65 to 74, will live for five years or more after being diagnosed with\u00a0nasopharyngeal cancer. \n You can read more about the\u00a0 statistics and outlook for nasopharyngeal cancer  on the Cancer Research UK website.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Meniere's disease", "introduction": "M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is a rare disorder that affects the inner ear. It can cause  vertigo ,  tinnitus ,  hearing loss , and a feeling of pressure deep inside the ear. \n People with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease usually experience some or all of these symptoms during sudden attacks, which typically last around two to three hours, although it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely. \n It's worth noting, however, that the symptoms and severity of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease vary widely from person to person. Some people may experience frequent attacks of vertigo along with hearing loss, while others may have severe tinnitus with minor vertigo. Other symptoms include sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis) or distorted sound. \n See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, so they can try to identify the problem and refer you to a specialist if necessary. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms and\u00a0stages\u00a0of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \u00a0and  diagnosing\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease  \n How\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease progresses \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease often progresses through different stages. In the early stages, most people have sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. \n The attacks of vertigo continue, but may come and go\u00a0and become less severe. It's common to experience a loss of balance or dizziness before or after these attacks. Permanent hearing loss and tinnitus continue to develop and may be worse during attacks of vertigo. \n During the later stages, the episodes of vertigo tend to occur less frequently and\u00a0sometimes stop altogether over time. However, the tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse and\u00a0you may be left with permanent balance and hearing\u00a0problems. \n Who is affected \n In the UK, it's estimated that around one in 1,000 people have M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease most commonly affects people aged 20-60 and it's thought to be slightly more common in women than men. \n What causes M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease? \n The exact cause of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is unknown, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear. \n Factors\u00a0that can increase your risk of developing M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease include a family history of the condition and a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear. \n Read more about the  causes of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease  \n How\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is treated \n Treatments for\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease can usually help people with the condition control their symptoms. However, current treatments aren't able to cure the condition. \n Possible treatments include: \n \n medicines to treat the symptoms and prevent attacks \n changes to your eating habits, such as a low-salt diet \n balance training (vestibular rehabilitation) \n relaxation techniques \n surgery, in more severe cases \n \n A\u00a0number of different surgical procedures\u00a0may be used to treat M\u00e9ni\u00e8res disease, depending on how severe the symptoms are and whether one or both ears are affected. However, the effectiveness of surgery is\u00a0unclear and research is continuing. \n Read more about the  treatment of\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease  \n Support and advice \n Some people with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease also find that the condition affects their\u00a0mental health. The unpredictable nature of the attacks and the restrictions this can place on your activities can lead to feelings of anxiety and  depression . \n Your GP can offer advice and support if you're finding it difficult to cope with the effect M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is having on your life.

You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register", "symptoms": "The symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease vary from person to person. They often begin as sudden attacks, lasting for a few hours. Some people may experience several attacks each week or they may be separated by weeks, months or even years. \n See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, so they can try to identify the problem and refer you to a specialist, if necessary. \n Main symptoms \n The main symptoms of\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease are: \n \n vertigo \u2013 the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning \n tinnitus \u2013\u00a0hearing sounds from inside\u00a0your body, rather than from an outside source \n  hearing loss , with a particular difficulty hearing deep or low sounds \n a sense of pressure or fullness\u00a0deep inside the\u00a0ear \n \n These symptoms\u00a0usually only affect one ear at first, but both ears\u00a0often become affected over time. \n Vertigo and tinnitus are described in more detail below. \n Vertigo \n  Vertigo \u00a0is one of the most common and noticeable symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.\u00a0 \n As well as a sensation of spinning, you may also experience additional symptoms during an attack of vertigo, such as dizziness, feeling or being sick, and problems with balance. You may have difficulty standing or walking. Occasionally, you may have \"drop attacks\", where you suddenly fall to the ground. \n During a severe attack,\u00a0you may\u00a0also experience sweating,  diarrhoea  and rapid or irregular heartbeats. \n Tinnitus \n  Tinnitus  is usually more noticeable when you're tired or when it's quiet, as there's less background noise to distract you from sounds coming from inside your body. \n Examples of\u00a0sounds you may hear include buzzing, humming, grinding, hissing and whistling. \n Stages of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is often\u00a0divided into early, middle and late stages. \n However, the progression of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease varies between individuals. You may not necessarily pass through each of these stages and the severity of the symptoms may also vary. In general, people experience more attacks during the first few years, and then as the attacks decrease in frequency over time, the hearing loss becomes progressively worse. \n Some or all of the following\u00a0symptoms may be experienced before an attack: \n \n loss of balance\u00a0 \n dizziness and lightheadedness \n headache and increased ear pressure \n increased hearing loss or tinnitus \n sensitivity to sound \n a feeling of uneasiness \n \n If a person is aware of these warning symptoms, it can allow\u00a0them to move to a safer or more comfortable situation before an attack. \n The stages of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease are described in more detail below. \n Early stage \n The early stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease consists of sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo. These are usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness. You may lose some hearing during the attack, and\u00a0you may experience\u00a0tinnitus at the same time. Your ear may also feel blocked and uncomfortable, with a sense of fullness. Some people may also experience sensitivity to sound. \n Attacks of vertigo at this stage can last from 20 minutes to 24 hours, but usually last around two to three hours. Your hearing and the full sensation in your ear usually returns to normal between attacks. \n Middle stage \n The middle stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease consists of continuing attacks of vertigo, with the attacks becoming less severe for some people. However, tinnitus and hearing loss often become worse. \n During the middle stage, you may experience some periods of remission (where your symptoms go away), which can last for up to several months. Some people may still experience symptoms of tinnitus, sensitivity to sound or loss of balance between attacks of vertigo. \n Late stage \n During the late stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, the episodes of vertigo occur far less frequently. There may be months or even several years between attacks or\u00a0they may stop altogether. However, you may be left with balance problems, and you may be unsteady on your feet, particularly in the dark. \n Hearing problems and tinnitus\u00a0tend to\u00a0become progressively worse during the late stage of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease.", "causes": "The exact cause of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease isn't clear, although it's thought to be caused by a problem with the pressure in the inner ear. \n The inner ear is made up of: \n \n the cochlea \u2013 a coiled, spiral tube that contains two fluid-filled chambers and is responsible for hearing \n the vestibular apparatus \u2013 a complex set of tubes that help to control balance \n \n The fluid inside the inner ear is called endolymph. \n If the pressure of the endolymph fluid changes \u2013 for example, because there is too much fluid \u2013 it can result in symptoms such as  vertigo  and  tinnitus . \n It's thought that this pressure change is responsible for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, although it hasn't been proven. \n Increased\u00a0risk \n Although the exact cause of\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is unknown, the following factors may increase the risk of developing the condition: \n \n autoimmunity \u2013 when your immune system attacks your own tissues and organs by mistake \n genetic (inherited) factors \u2013 for example, if you have a family history of the condition \n a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear\u00a0\u2013 as a result of too little or too much sodium or potassium in your body \n a problem with the blood vessels \u2013 there's a link between M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and  migraines , which are thought to be caused by the narrowing and widening of blood vessels \n some viral infections \u2013 such as  meningitis", "treatment": "Treatment can usually help to control the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, although there's currently no cure. \n Your ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist and your GP can help you manage your symptoms. Possible treatments include: \n \n dietary advice\u00a0\u2013 particularly a low-salt diet \n medication to treat and prevent attacks \n  treatment for tinnitus \u00a0 \n  treatment for hearing loss  \n treatment called vestibular rehabilitation to cope with balance problems \n treatment for stress, anxiety and  depression  \n surgery \n \n Your GP and ENT specialist should provide you with advice tailored to your individual needs, and should develop a plan to\u00a0help you manage your symptoms. \n In some cases, the treatment available may depend on what your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) can provide. \n Treatment during an attack \n During an attack of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you may be prescribed medication to treat the symptoms of  vertigo , nausea and vomiting. \n This is\u00a0usually\u00a0prochlorperazine or an antihistamine. If these work, you may be given a supply to keep, so you can take them quickly during an attack. \n Prochlorperazine \n Prochlorperazine can cause side effects including tremors (shaking) and involuntary body or facial movements. It can also make some people feel sleepy. \n Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects, or read more about prochlorperazine. \n If you experience vomiting during your attacks, you can take a type of prochlorperazine called Buccastem. This comes as a tablet that you place between your gums and your cheek, on the inside of your mouth. The tablet dissolves and is absorbed into your body. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines you may be prescribed include cinnarizine, cyclizine\u00a0and promethazine teoclate. \n Antihistamines can make you feel sleepy. Headaches and an upset stomach are also possible side effects. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects. \n What to do during an attack \n During an attack, take your medication as soon as possible and grab the nearest available support. Get into a position in which you feel most stable or comfortable, and keep as still as possible. If you need to move, do so slowly and carefully. Close your eyes or keep them fixed on objects in front of you, and don't turn your head quickly. \n Once your symptoms start to improve, it's best to gradually try to move around, as this encourages your brain to use your vision and other senses to compensate for the problems in your inner ear. \n Severe attacks \n If you suffer severe vertigo, dizziness, nausea and vomiting during an attack of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, you may need to be injected with prochlorperazine by your doctor. \n If you suffer severe vertigo with or without nausea during an attack, your doctor may also prescribe you a tablet of Buccastem that dissolves very quickly in your mouth (see above). \n In\u00a0particularly severe cases, you may need to be admitted to hospital to receive intravenous fluids (through a vein) to keep you hydrated. \n Preventing attacks \n Your GP can prescribe a medication called betahistine to help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, or you may be advised to change your diet. \n Special diets \n Although it has not been proven to be consistently effective, following a diet without added salt can help some people to control their symptoms. It's possible that this type of diet might alter the fluids in your inner ear. \n Avoiding excessive caffeine, found in drinks such as tea and coffee, is also usually recommended. \n Betahistine \n Betahistine is thought to\u00a0reduce the pressure of the fluid in your inner ear, relieving the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Your GP may recommend trying them to see if they help. \n Betahistines are usually available as tablets to be taken three times a day. Your GP will discuss how long you need to take them for, which could be a few weeks, or up to a year. Possible side effects include a headache, upset stomach and a rash. \n Treating tinnitus \n A\u00a0number of different treatments can be used to treat tinnitus caused by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. Some possibilities include: \n \n Sound therapy \u2013 the effects of tinnitus are often more pronounced in quiet environments. The aim of sound therapy is to fill the silence with neutral, often repetitive sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus. \n Relaxation techniques \u2013 tinnitus can be a distressing and intrusive condition. Relaxing by practising  yoga  or special breathing techniques may help you to avoid stress and anxiety. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 this is a therapy based on the knowledge that M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's symptoms can have a significant psychological effect, resulting in negative thoughts and changes in behaviour. This\u00a0may aggravate your symptoms and create a vicious circle. CBT is given by a specially trained professional who aims to change the way you think and behave, to break this cycle. \n \n Read more about  treating tinnitus  \n Treating hearing loss \n You may experience permanent hearing loss if M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is in the middle or end stages. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease tends to make you more sensitive to loud sounds, and also makes it more difficult for you to distinguish low-pitched sounds. \n There are a variety of hearing aids available. Hearing therapists and organisations, such as  Action on Hearing Loss , can provide you with helpful advice for dealing with hearing loss. \n Read more about  treating hearing loss  \n Vestibular rehabilitation \n Vestibular rehabilitation (VRT) is usually provided by a hearing specialist or physiotherapist. Your GP may be able to refer you for VRT, although it will depend on the\u00a0availability in your area. \n A vestibular therapist or specially trained physiotherapist can help improve your balance by teaching you vestibular rehabilitation techniques. These exercises teach you how to cope with the disorientating signals coming from your inner ear. You're taught to use alternative signals from your eyes, ankles, legs and neck, to keep you balanced. \n Vestibular therapy is usually used in the middle or late stages of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, after the severe attacks of vertigo have stopped, but when balance problems may remain. \n In some cases, it may be possible to use VRT without specialist help. Research has shown that some people can improve their symptoms by using self-help VRT booklets. However, you should discuss this with your doctor first.\u00a0 \n Surgery \n In severe cases, surgery can be performed to control the attacks of vertigo. However, surgical procedures are usually only used if other treatments have failed. \n The type of surgery you have will depend on your symptoms, and whether both ears are affected. You could have: \n \n non-destructive surgery \n selectively destructive surgery \n destructive surgery \n \n Non-destructive surgery \n Non-destructive surgery may be used if your hearing in the affected ear is \"socially adequate\" (you can hear sounds that are below 50 decibels). This type of surgery aims to change the progression of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease by reducing the severity and frequency of your symptoms. \n Types of non-destructive surgery include: \n \n endolymphatic sac decompression \u2013 this can help to reduce the pressure in your inner ear by increasing the drainage of the fluid of your inner ear, although evidence of its effectiveness for\u00a0M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is limited \n inserting ventilation tubes (grommets) \u2013 these are inserted into your ear to reduce the changes in pressure that cause M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease \n injecting steroid medication through the eardrum \u2013 although there's only limited evidence to suggest\u00a0that this is an\u00a0effective treatment \n micropressure therapy \u2013 a newer type of treatment with little evidence regarding its safety and effectiveness; grommets are inserted into your ear and attached to a small pressure generator for a few minutes, several times a day, to alter the pressure in the inner ear \n \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on  micropressure therapy for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease . \n Selectively destructive surgery \n In selectively destructive surgery, the balance part of the inner ear is destroyed with a medicine called gentamicin. This is injected through the ear drum (the thin layer of tissue separating the outer ear from the middle ear) and enters the labyrinth (the system of tubes in the inner ear). \n Gentamicin should mainly damage the balance part of your ear, but there's a risk it could damage your hearing as well. \n Some surgeons prefer to apply the gentamicin directly to the inner ear during a minor operation. This means they can control the exact dose of gentamicin that enters your ear. \n Destructive surgery \n Destructive surgery may be considered if only one ear is affected by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. The hearing in the affected ear must be considered to be \"socially inadequate\" (you can't hear enough to function in social situations). As an approximate guide, if you can't hear sounds below 50 decibels, this may count as socially inadequate. \n Destructive surgery is used to destroy the part of your inner ear causing your vertigo attacks. However, these operations can cause permanent hearing loss in the treated ear, so will only be considered if you already have permanently reduced hearing in the affected ear. \n Destructive surgery can\u00a0be done by: \n \n destroying the balance part of your audio-vestibular nerve \u2013 the nerve transmitting sounds and balance information to the brain \n destroying part of your vestibular labyrinth (labyrinthectomy) \u2013 the system of tiny, fluid-filled channels in the ear \n \n After surgery, your other ear will take over your hearing and balance functions. \n Safety and effectiveness of surgery \n There are very few clinical trials looking into the effectiveness of surgery for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, which is why surgery is rarely considered. If your ENT specialist thinks you may benefit from having surgery, they'll discuss the procedure and any risks in more detail with you. \n Support groups and charities \n There are several support groups and charities that can provide you with useful information and advice about living with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. They can also put you in touch with other people with the condition. \n See  living with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease  for more information \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and the placebo effect \n The placebo effect is the unusual psychological effect that can occur when a person is given a \"dummy\" medication, such as a sugar pill. They feel better after taking the pill, because they think they're being given real medication. \n Although there's limited scientific evidence to suggest that many of the self-help measures and treatments used for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease are consistently effective, they can help some people to control their symptoms because of the placebo effect.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "There's no single test for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and the condition can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions with similar symptoms. \n For example,\u00a0 migraines  and ear infections can also affect your balance and hearing. A viral infection of the balance nerve (vestibular neuronitis) or the inner ear ( labyrinthitis ) can also produce similar  vertigo  attacks. \n Seeing your GP \n See your GP if you experience any of the symptoms of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. \n They'll ask you to describe your symptoms to find out if a pattern is emerging\u00a0that\u00a0could indicate M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. \n For M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease to be diagnosed, you'll need to have the following characteristic symptoms: \n \n  vertigo  (a feeling that the environment around you is spinning) \u2013 at least two episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes or more within a single M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease attack \n  hearing loss  \u2013 tests must confirm that hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled tube in the inner ear) \n  tinnitus  (hearing noises from within your body) or a feeling of pressure in your ear \n \n Your GP\u00a0may also carry out a general physical examination to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. This may involve listening to your heartbeat, checking your blood pressure and examining the inside of your ears. \n Seeing a specialist \n If necessary, your GP can refer you to a specialist for further tests. \n In most cases, you'll probably be referred to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist at the ENT department of your local hospital. \n You can also\u00a0be referred to a specialist in audiovestibular medicine for hearing and balance assessment, although this service may not be available in every hospital. \n Hearing tests \n The specialist will be able to assess the extent of your hearing loss by using hearing tests, such as an audiometry test. \n During an audiometry test, you listen to sounds of different volume and pitch produced by a machine and signal when you hear a sound, either by raising your hand or pressing a button. \n Read more about  how hearing tests are carried out  \n Videonystagmography \n Videonystagmography (VNG) may be used to check for signs of uncontrollable eye movements (nystagmus) because this can indicate a problem with balance. \n During this test, special goggles are placed over your eyes and you'll be asked to look at various still and moving targets. The goggles are fitted with a video camera to record your eye movements. \n Caloric testing \n A caloric\u00a0test involves putting warm and cool water or air in your ear for about 30 seconds. The change in temperature stimulates the balance organ in the ear, allowing the specialist to check how well it's working. \n This test isn't painful, although it's normal to feel dizzy for a few minutes afterwards. \n Electrocochleography \n Electrocochleography is\u00a0a test used to measure how your hearing nerves respond to sound. \n During\u00a0this test, a series of electrodes\u00a0are attached to your head and\u00a0a thin probe or\u00a0needle\u00a0is\u00a0passed into your ear so it touches or passes through\u00a0your eardrum.  Local anaesthetic  will be used to numb your eardrum before the procedure if a needle is going to be passed through it. \n You will then listen to a series\u00a0of\u00a0loud clicks, while the activity of your nerves is picked up by the electrodes and probe or needle. \n Scans \n In some cases, a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  of your head may be carried out to look for any abnormalities in your brain \u2013 such as an acoustic neuroma (a non-cancerous tumour) \u2013 that could be causing your symptoms."},

The HPU will arrange for a sample of saliva to be tested to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. \n How mumps is spread \n Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu \u2013 through infected droplets of saliva\u00a0that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.\u00a0\u00a0 \n A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards. \n During this time, it's important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who haven't been vaccinated. \n If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by: \n \n regularly washing your hands with soap \n using and disposing of tissues when you sneeze \n avoiding school or work for at least five days after your symptoms first develop \n \n Preventing mumps \n You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they're given the combined\u00a0MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella).\u00a0The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS\u00a0childhood immunisation schedule.\u00a0 \n Your child should be given one dose when they are around 12-13 months and a second booster dose before they start school.\u00a0Your child needs to get 2 doses of the vaccine to provide the best protection against mumps. \n Treatment for mumps \n There's currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks. \n Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes: \n \n getting plenty of bed rest and fluids \n using painkillers, such as  ibuprofen \u00a0and  paracetamol \u00a0\u2013 aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16 \n applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain \n \n Read more about  treating mumps  \n Complications \n Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person's health.\u00a0Serious complications are rare. \n However, mumps can lead to viral\u00a0 meningitis  if the\u00a0virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males\u00a0or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has\u00a0gone through puberty). \n Read more about the  complications of mumps  \n Who is affected \n Most cases of mumps occur in young\u00a0adults (usually born between 1980 and 1990) who didn\u2019t receive the\u00a0MMR vaccine as part of their childhood vaccination schedule or didn't have mumps as a child.\u00a0There were 2,224 confirmed cases of mumps\u00a0in England and Wales during 2014. \n Once you've been infected by the\u00a0mumps virus, you normally develop a life-long immunity to further infection.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after becoming infected with the mumps virus (this delay is known as the incubation period). The average incubation period is around 17 days. \n Swelling of the parotid glands is the most common symptom of mumps. The parotid glands are a pair of glands responsible for producing saliva. They're located in either side of your face, just below your ears. \n Both glands are usually affected by the swelling, although only one gland can be affected. The swelling can cause pain, tenderness and\u00a0difficulty with swallowing. \n More general symptoms often develop a few days before the parotid glands swell. These can include: \n \n  headache  \n joint pain \n feeling sick \n dry mouth \n mild abdominal pain \n feeling tired \n loss of appetite \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F), or above \n \n In about\u00a0one in\u00a0three cases, mumps doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms. \n When to seek medical advice \n If you suspect mumps, it's important to call your GP. \n While the infection isn't usually serious, mumps\u00a0has similar\u00a0symptoms to other, more serious types of infection, such as\u00a0 glandular fever  and  tonsillitis . It's always best to visit your GP so they can confirm (or rule out) a diagnosis of mumps. \n It's also important to let\u00a0your GP\u00a0know in advance if\u00a0you're coming to the surgery\u00a0so they can take any necessary precautions to avoid the spread of infection.", "causes": "Mumps is caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to a family of viruses known as paramyxoviruses. These viruses are a common source of infection, particularly in children. \n When you get mumps, the virus moves from your respiratory tract (your nose, mouth and throat) into your parotid glands (saliva-producing glands found either side of your face), where it begins to reproduce. This causes the glands to swell. \n The virus can also enter your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain and spine. Once the virus has entered the CSF, it can spread to other parts of your body, such as your brain, pancreas, testicles (in boys and men) and ovaries (in girls and women). \n How mumps is spread \n Mumps is an airborne virus and can be spread by: \n \n an infected person coughing or sneezing and releasing tiny droplets of contaminated saliva, which can then be breathed in by another person \n an infected person touching their nose or mouth, then transferring the virus onto an object, such as a door handle, or work surface; if someone else touches the object shortly afterwards, they can transfer the virus into their respiratory tract \n sharing utensils, such as cups, cutlery or plates with an infected person \n \n People with mumps are usually most infectious\u00a0from a few days before their parotid glands swell until a few days afterwards. For this reason, it's advisable to avoid work or school for five days after your symptoms\u00a0first develop\u00a0if you're diagnosed with mumps. \n Mumps\u00a0can also be passed on by people who are infected with\u00a0the virus\u00a0but don't have any obvious symptoms.", "treatment": "Treatment for mumps is focused on relieving symptoms until your body\u2019s immune system fights off the infection. There are currently no medications to treat the mumps virus. \n The infection usually passes within\u00a0a week or two. \n In the meantime, the measures below may help. \n \n get plenty of bed rest until your symptoms have passed \n take over-the-counter painkillers, such as\u00a0 ibuprofen  or  paracetamol , to relieve any pain (children\u00a0aged 16 or under should not be given aspirin) \n drink plenty of fluids, but avoid acidic drinks such as fruit juice as these can irritate your parotid glands; water is usually the best fluid to drink \n apply a warm or cool compress to your swollen glands\u00a0to help reduce\u00a0any pain \n eat foods that don't require a lot of chewing, such as soup, mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs \n \n If your symptoms don\u2019t improve after seven days, or\u00a0suddenly worsen,\u00a0contact your GP for advice. \n Preventing the spread of infection \n If you or your child has mumps, it\u2019s important to prevent the infection spreading, particularly\u00a0to younger people born between 1980\u00a0and 1990 (these people are unlikely to have immunity from a previous infection, and are also unlikely to have been vaccinated). \n The best way to do this is to: \n \n stay away from school, college or work until five days after\u00a0you first developed symptoms \n wash your hands regularly, using soap and water \n always use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze, and throw the tissue in a bin immediately afterwards", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you suspect that you or your child has mumps, it's important to\u00a0see your GP\u00a0for a diagnosis. \n Let your GP know in advance of your surgery visit so\u00a0any necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infection can be taken. \n Mumps\u00a0can usually be\u00a0diagnosed from the symptoms, in particular\u00a0the swelling of\u00a0glands in the sides of your face (parotid glands). \n If you have mumps, your GP can see and feel the swelling. By looking inside your mouth, they may be able to see that your tonsils have been pushed out of their usual position. \n Your GP can also check your temperature to see if it is higher than normal. \n If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify\u00a0your local health protection unit (HPU).

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Multiple sclerosis (MS)", "introduction": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition which can affect the brain and/or spinal cord, causing a wide range of potential symptoms, including problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance. \n It's a lifelong condition that can sometimes cause serious disability, although it can occasionally be mild. In many cases, it\u2019s possible to treat symptoms. Average life expectancy is slightly reduced for people with MS. \n It's estimated that there are more than 100,000 people diagnosed with MS in the UK. \n It's most commonly diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s, although it can develop at any age. It's about two to three times more common in women than men. \n Symptoms of MS \n The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person and can affect any part of the body. \n The main symptoms include: \n \n fatigue \n difficulty walking \n vision problems, such as blurred vision \n problems controlling the bladder \n numbness or tingling in different parts of the body \n muscle stiffness and spasms \n problems with balance and co-ordination \n problems with thinking, learning and planning \n \n Depending on the type of MS you have (see below), your symptoms may come and go in phases, or get steadily worse over time (progress). \n Read more about the  symptoms of MS  \n Getting medical advice \n See your GP if you're worried you might have early signs of MS. \n The early symptoms often have many other causes, so they're not necessarily a sign of MS. Let your GP know about the specific pattern of symptoms you\u2019re experiencing. \n If you GP thinks you could have MS, you'll be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system), who may suggest tests such as a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  to check for features of MS. \n Read more about  diagnosing MS  \n Types of MS \n MS starts in one of two general ways: with individual relapses (attacks or exacerbations) or with gradual progression. \n Relapsing-remitting MS \n More than 8 out of every 10 people with MS are diagnosed with the \"relapsing remitting\" type. \n Someone with relapsing remitting MS will have episodes of new or worsening symptoms, known as \"relapses\". These typically worsen over a few days, last for days to weeks to months, then slowly improve over a similar time period. \n Relapses often occur without warning, but are sometimes associated with a period of illness or stress. \n The symptoms of a relapse may disappear altogether, with or without treatment, although some symptoms\u00a0often persist, with repeated attacks happening over several years. \n Periods between attacks are known as periods of \"remission\". These can last for years at a time. \n After many years (usually decades), many, but not all people, with relapsing remitting MS go on to develop secondary progressive MS. In this type of MS, symptoms gradually worsen over time without obvious attacks. Some people continue to have infrequent relapses during this stage. \n Around half of people with relapsing remitting MS will develop secondary progressive MS within 15-20 years, and the risk of this happening increases the longer you have the condition. \n Primary progressive MS \n Just over 1 in 10 people with the condition start their MS with a gradual worsening of symptoms. \n In primary progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and accumulate over several years, and there are no periods of remission, though people often have periods where their condition appears to stabilise. \n What causes MS? \n MS is an autoimmune condition. This is when something goes wrong with the immune system and it mistakenly attacks a healthy part of the body \u2013 in this case, the brain or spinal cord of the nervous system. \n In MS, the immune system attacks the layer that surrounds and protects the nerves, called the myelin sheath. This damages and scars the sheath, and potentially the underlying nerves, meaning that messages travelling along the nerves become slowed or disrupted. \n Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of MS  \n Treatments for MS \n There's currently no cure for MS, but a number of treatments can help control the condition. \n The treatment you need will depend on the specific symptoms and difficulties\u00a0you have. It may include: \n \n treating relapses with short courses of\u00a0 steroid medication  to speed up recovery \n specific treatments for\u00a0individual MS symptoms \n treatment to reduce the number of relapses with medicines called disease-modifying therapies \n \n Disease-modifying therapies may also help to slow or reduce the overall worsening of disability of MS in people with relapsing remitting MS, and in people with secondary progressive MS who are still having relapses. \n Unfortunately, there's currently no treatment that can slow the progress of primary progressive MS or secondary progressive MS in the absence of relapses. Many therapies aiming to treat progressive MS are currently being researched. \n Read more about  how MS is treated \u00a0and  living with MS  \n Outlook \n MS can be a challenging condition to live with, but new treatments over the past 20 years have considerably improved the quality of life of people with the condition. \n MS itself is rarely fatal, but complications may arise from severe MS, such as chest or bladder infections, or swallowing difficulties. \n The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average,\u00a0and\u00a0this gap appears to be getting smaller all the time.", "symptoms": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. Each person with the condition is affected differently. \n The symptoms are unpredictable. Some people's symptoms develop and worsen steadily over time, while for others they come and go. \n Periods when symptoms get worse are known as \"relapses\". Periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as \"remissions\". \n Some of the most common symptoms include: \n \n  fatigue  \n  vision problems  \n  numbness and tingling  \n  muscle spasms, stiffness and weakness  \n  mobility problems  \n  pain  \n  problems with thinking, learning and planning  \n  depression and anxiety  \n  sexual problems  \n  bladder problems  \n  bowel problems  \n  speech and swallowing difficulties  \n \n Most people with MS only have a few of these symptoms. \n See your GP if you're worried you might have early signs of MS.\u00a0The symptoms can be similar to several\u00a0other conditions, so they're not necessarily caused by MS.\u00a0 \n Read more about  diagnosing MS  \n Fatigue \n Feeling fatigued is one of the most common and troublesome symptoms of MS. \n It's often described as an overwhelming sense of exhaustion that means it's a struggle to carry out even the simplest activities. \n Fatigue can significantly interfere with your daily activities and tends to get worse towards the end of each day, in hot weather, after exercising, or during illness. \n Vision problems \n In around one in four cases of MS, the first noticeable symptom is a problem with one of your eyes (optic neuritis). You may experience: \n \n some temporary\u00a0loss of vision in the affected eye, usually lasting for days to weeks \n colour blindness\u00a0 \n eye pain, which is usually worse when moving the eye \n flashes of light when moving the eye \n \n Other problems that can occur in the eyes include: \n \n double vision \n involuntary eye movements, which can make it seem as though stationary objects are jumping around \n \n Occasionally, both of your eyes may be affected. \n Abnormal sensations \n Abnormal sensations can be a common initial symptom of MS. \n This often takes the form of numbness or tingling in different parts of your body, such as the arms, legs or trunk, which typically spreads out over a few days. \n Muscle spasms, stiffness and weakness \n MS\u00a0can cause your\u00a0muscles to: \n \n contract tightly and painfully (spasm) \n become stiff and resistant to movement (spasticity) \n feel weak \n \n Mobility problems \n MS can make walking and moving around difficult, particularly if you also have muscle weakness and spasticity (see above). You may experience: \n \n clumsiness \n difficulty with balance and co-ordination (ataxia) \n shaking of the limbs (tremor) \n dizziness and  vertigo , which\u00a0can make\u00a0it feel as\u00a0though\u00a0everything around you is\u00a0spinning \n \n Pain \n Some people with MS experience pain, which can take two forms: \n \n Pain caused by MS itself (neuropathic pain) \u2013 this is pain caused by damage to the nervous system. This may include stabbing pains in the face and a variety of sensations in the trunk and limbs, including feelings of burning, pins and needles, hugging or squeezing. Muscle spasms can sometimes be painful. \n Musculoskeletal pain \u2013 back, neck and joint pain can be indirectly caused by MS, particularly for people who have problems walking or moving around that puts pressure on their lower back or hips. \n \n Problems with thinking, learning and planning \n Some people with MS have problems with thinking, learning and planning \u2013 known as cognitive dysfunction. This can include: \n \n problems learning and remembering new things \u2013 long-term memory is usually unaffected \n slowness in processing lots of information or multi-tasking \n a shortened attention span \n getting stuck on words \n problems with understanding and processing visual information, such as reading a map \n difficulty with planning and problem solving \u2013 people often report that they know what they want to do, but can't grasp how to do it \n problems with reasoning, such as mathematical laws or solving puzzles \n \n However, many of these problems aren't specific to MS and can be caused by a wide range of other conditions, including depression and anxiety, or even some medications. \n Mental health issues \n Many\u00a0people with MS experience periods of  depression . It's unclear whether this is directly caused by MS, or is due to the stress of having to live with a long-term condition, or both. \n  Anxiety \u00a0can also be a problem for people with MS, possibly due to the unpredictable nature of the condition. \n In rare cases, people with MS can experience rapid and severe mood swings, suddenly bursting into tears, laughing or shouting angrily for no apparent reason. \n Sexual problems \n MS can have an effect on sexual function. \n Men with MS often find it hard to obtain or maintain an erection ( erectile dysfunction ). They may also find it takes a lot longer to ejaculate when having sex or masturbating, and may even lose the ability to ejaculate altogether. \n For women, problems include difficulty reaching orgasm, as well as decreased vaginal lubrication and sensation. \n Both men and women with MS may find they are less interested in sex than they were before. This could be directly related to MS, or it could be the result of living with the condition. \n Bladder problems \n Bladder problems are common in MS. They may include: \n \n having to pee more frequently \n having a sudden, urgent need to pee, which can lead to unintentionally passing urine ( urge incontinence ) \n difficulty emptying the bladder completely \n having to get up frequently during the night to pee \n recurrent\u00a0 urinary tract infections  \n \n These problems can also have a range of causes other than MS. \n Bowel problems \n Many people with MS also have problems with their bowel function. \n  Constipation \u00a0is the most common problem.\u00a0You may find passing stools difficult and pass them much less frequently than normal. \n  Bowel incontinence \u00a0is less common, but is often linked to constipation. If a stool becomes stuck, it can irritate the wall of the bowel, causing it to produce more fluid and mucus that can leak out of\u00a0your bottom. \n Again, some of these problems aren't specific to MS and can even be the result of medications, such as medicines prescribed for pain. \n Speech and swallowing difficulties \n Some people with MS experience difficulty chewing or\u00a0swallowing ( dysphagia ) at some point. \n Speech may also become slurred, or difficult to understand (dysarthria).", "causes": "Exactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't known. It's not caused by anything you've done and it's not clear whether it can be prevented. \n What is known so far suggests it's caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. \n What happens in MS \n MS is an autoimmune condition, which means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it. \n In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body. \n The attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions), which can be seen on a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . \n These patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. It can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. This disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of MS. \n When the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can eventually lead to permanent damage to the underlying nerves. \n Why do people\u00a0get MS? \n It's not\u00a0clear what causes the immune system to attack the myelin sheath. \n It seems likely that it's partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition. \n Some of the factors that have been suggested as possible causes of MS include: \n \n your genes \u2013\u00a0MS isn't directly inherited, but people who are related to someone with\u00a0the condition\u00a0are more likely to develop it;\u00a0the chance of a sibling or child of someone with MS also developing it is estimated to be around 2-3% \n lack of sunlight and\u00a0vitamin\u00a0D \u2013\u00a0MS is more common in countries far from the equator,\u00a0which could\u00a0mean that a lack of sunlight and low vitamin D levels may play a role in the condition, although it's not clear whether vitamin D supplements can help prevent MS \n smoking \u2013 people who smoke are about twice as likely to develop MS compared to\u00a0those who don't smoke \n viral infections \u2013\u00a0it has been suggested that infections, particularly those caused by Epstein-Barr virus (responsible for  glandular fever ), might trigger the immune system, leading to MS in some people \n \n More research is needed to further understand\u00a0why MS occurs and whether anything can be done to prevent it.", "treatment": "Contact your specialist MS nurse or GP if you think you're having\u00a0a relapse. \n A flare up of symptoms can sometimes be caused by something other than a relapse, such as an infection, so your nurse or GP needs to check for other possible causes. \n Treatment for a relapse usually involves either: \n \n a five-day course of steroid tablets taken at home \n injections of steroid medication given in hospital for three to five days \n \n Steroids can help speed up your recovery from a relapse, but they don't\u00a0prevent further relapses or stop MS getting worse over time. \n They are only given for a short period of time to avoid possible  steroid side effects , such as\u00a0 osteoporosis (weak bones) , weight gain and\u00a0 diabetes , although some people will still experience problems. \n Not using steroids more than three times a year (if possible) will also help to reduce the risk of side effects. \n Treatment for specific MS symptoms \n MS can cause a range of symptoms that can be treated individually. Treatments for some of the main symptoms are outlined below. \n Fatigue \n Many people with MS experience fatigue. \n For fatigue caused by MS, you may be prescribed amantadine, although this medication may only have a limited effect. You should also be given general advice on ways to manage fatigue, such as exercise, keeping healthy sleep patterns, energy-saving techniques and avoiding medications that can worsen fatigue (including some painkillers). \n Specialist fatigue management courses or therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), can also help some people with MS cope with their fatigue. \n Visual problems \n MS-related visual problems will often improve on their own, usually within a few weeks, so you may not need any treatment. If your symptoms are particularly severe, you may be prescribed steroids to help speed up recovery. \n If you have problems with involuntary eye movements, medication such as gabapentin can sometimes help. Some people with double vision need help from ophthalmologists (eye specialists). \n Muscle spasms and stiffness \n Muscle spasms and stiffness (spasticity) can be improved with physiotherapy.\u00a0Techniques\u00a0such as stretching exercises can help if your movement is restricted. \n If your muscle spasms are more severe, you may be prescribed a medicine that can relax your muscles. This will usually be either baclofen or gabapentin, although there are alternative medicines, such as tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam and dantrolene. \n These medicines all have side effects, such as dizziness, weakness, nausea and diarrhoea, so discuss which of these would be best for you with your\u00a0specialist MS nurse or GP. \n Mobility problems \n Mobility problems are often the result of muscle spasms and spasticity (see above), but they can also be caused by muscle weakness, or problems with balance or dizziness. \n If you have problems with mobility, you might benefit from: \n \n an exercise programme\u00a0supervised by a physiotherapist \n special exercises called vestibular rehabilitation, if you have problems with balance \n medication for dizziness or tremors \n mobility aids, such as a walking stick, or occasionally a wheelchair \n home adaptations such as stair lifts or railings \n \n An\u00a0 occupational therapist \u00a0can carry out an assessment of your home and suggest adaptations that may be of help. \n Neuropathic pain \n Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to your nerves and is usually sharp and stabbing. It can also occur in the form of extreme skin sensitivity, or a burning sensation. \n This type of pain can be treated using the medicines gabapentin or carbamazepine, or with a medication called amitriptyline. This is an older type of\u00a0 antidepressant , but these days it's mainly used for pain control. \n Musculoskeletal pain \n Living with MS can cause stresses and strains to the muscles and joints in your body. \n A physiotherapist may be able to help with\u00a0this pain by suggesting exercise techniques or better seating positions. \n If your pain is more severe, you may be prescribed painkillers. Alternatively, you may have a device that stimulates your nerves, called as a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine. \n Problems with thinking, learning and memory \n If you experience\u00a0problems with thinking and memory, any treatment you receive will be fully explained and recorded, so that it's clear to you. \n You should be referred to a clinical psychologist, who will assess your problems and suggest ways to manage them. \n Emotional problems \n If you experience emotional outbursts, such as laughing or crying for no apparent reason, you should be assessed by a specialist such as a clinical psychologist. They may suggest treatment with an antidepressant. \n People with MS who have  depression  can also be treated with antidepressants or therapy, such as CBT. \n If you often feel anxious or worried, you may be prescribed antidepressants or benzodiazepines, which are a type of tranquilliser that have a calming effect. \n Sexual problems \n Men\u00a0with MS who find it hard to obtain or maintain an erection ( erectile dysfunction ) may be prescribed\u00a0medication to\u00a0temporarily increase the blood flow to the penis,\u00a0such as sildenafil (Viagra). This is provided by the NHS if you have MS. \n Relationship counselling or seeing a\u00a0sex therapist may also help both men\u00a0and women with MS who are having problems with reduced interest in sex or difficulty reaching orgasm. \n Bladder problems \n Various medications are available if you have an overactive bladder or need to pee frequently during the night. \n If you find it difficult to empty your bladder, advice from a continence nurse or physiotherapist can help. Hand-held external stimulators can also help some people to start peeing or to empty the bladder. \n Occasionally, a\u00a0 catheter \u00a0can be used to empty the bladder when needed. In rare cases, people with MS may need a long-term catheter to keep the bladder emptying safely. \n You may be referred to a continence adviser or urologist, who can offer specialist treatment and advice, such as botulinim toxin injections, bladder exercises or electrical treatment for your bladder muscles. Read more about  treating urinary incontinence . \n Bowel problems \n It may be possible to treat mild to moderate  constipation  by changing your diet or taking  laxatives . \n More severe constipation may need to be treated with suppositories, which are inserted into your bottom, or an enema. An enema involves having a liquid medication rinsed through your bottom and large bowel, which softens and flushes out your stools. \n  Bowel incontinence \u00a0can sometimes be treated with anti-diarrhoea medication or by doing pelvic floor exercises to strengthen your rectal muscles. \n Speech and swallowing difficulties \n A\u00a0speech and language therapist can help you find ways to overcome problems with speech and swallowing. \n For example, they can offer advice about foods that are easy to swallow and they can recommend exercises to strengthen the muscles used in speech and swallowing. \n If swallowing problems become very severe, some people need to be fed using a tube, which is fitted into the stomach through the skin. \n Disease-modifying therapies \n Although MS can't currently be cured, there are medicines that can help to reduce the number and severity of relapses in some people. These are called \"disease-modifying therapies\". \n These aim to reduce the amount of damage and scarring to the myelin sheath (layer surrounding your nerves), associated with MS relapses. \n These treatments may also help to slow worsening disability in MS, although definitive research into their long-term benefits is limited. \n Disease-modifying therapies are not suitable for everyone with MS. They're only prescribed to those with relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS who meet certain criteria, such as the number of relapses they've had. \n People without relapses are very unlikely to benefit from the treatments and could still experience side effects from them. \n Beta interferon \n The types of beta interferon licensed for use in the UK are interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif and Plegridy) and interferon beta-1b (Betaferon and Extavia). These are all given by injection. \n You may be offered treatment with one of these medicines if either: \n \n you've got relapsing remitting MS and you've had a recent relapse and/or MRI scans show that your MS is active \n you have secondary progressive MS and still have significant relapses \n \n All beta interferons often cause mild side effects, particularly flu-like symptoms ( headaches , chills and mild fever), for 24-48 hours after they\u2019re injected, and temporary pain or redness at the injection site. \n Glatiramer acetate \n One brand of glatiramer acetate, called Copaxone, is licensed for use in the UK. It's injected under the skin either every day or at a higher dose three times a week.\u00a0 \n You may be offered treatment with glatiramer acetate if you've got relapsing remitting MS and you've had a recent relapse, and/or MRI scans show that your MS is active. \n Common side effects of glatiramer acetate include problems with redness or hardening of the skin at the injection sites, and occasionally palpitations or flushing after the injection. \n Teriflunomide \n Teriflunomide,\u00a0branded as Aubagio, is a tablet taken once a day. \n You may be offered treatment with teriflunomide if\u00a0you have relapsing remitting MS and you've had a recent relapse, and/or MRI scans show that your MS is active. \n Common side effects of teriflunomide include headaches, feeling sick,\u00a0 diarrhoea  and hair thinning or\u00a0hair loss. You'll also need blood tests frequently in the early months of treatment to check for problems with liver function. \n Natalizumab \n Natalizumab, branded as Tysabri, is injected into a vein (known as an infusion) once every 28 days. \n You may be offered treatment with natalizumab if you have severe relapsing remitting MS that's getting worse quite quickly \u2013 for example, if you've had two or more severe relapses within a year and MRI scans show that your MS is getting worse. \n Side effects of natalizumab are rare, but can include an increased risk of an itch or rash (hives), headaches,\u00a0dizziness, joint pain, and feeling or being sick at the time of the infusions. \n The main concern of treatment with natalizumab is a risk of a brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This is uncommon, but can become a significant problem with long-term treatment in some people. \n Fingolimod \n Fingolimod, branded as Gilenya, is taken as a capsule once a day. \n You may be offered treatment with fingolimod if you have relapsing remitting MS and you experience the same or an increased number of relapses, despite treatment with other medications such as beta interferons. \n The medication doesn\u2019t usually cause significant side effects, but some people experience an increased risk of infections, headaches, diarrhoea, liver problems and visual problems. \n Alemtuzumab \n Alemtuzumab, branded as Lemtrada or Genzyme,\u00a0is\u00a0initially given into a vein once a day for five consecutive days. This is followed by a second course of treatment a year later, which\u00a0lasts for three consecutive days. \n You may be offered treatment with alemtuzumab if you've got relapsing remitting MS and you've had a relapse in the past year, and/or MRI scans show that your MS is active. \n Common side effects of alemtuzumab include an increased risk of infections, headaches, rashes and fever. Regular blood and urine tests will be carried out to monitor treatment. \n Dimethyl fumarate \n Dimethyl fumarate, branded as Tecfidera, is a tablet taken twice a day. \n You may be offered treatment with dimethyl fumarate if you've got relapsing remitting MS and you've had a recent relapse and/or MRI scans show that your MS is active. \n Common side effects of dimethyl fumarate include hot flushes, diarrhoea, nausea,\u00a0 abdominal (tummy) pain  and headaches. Stomach upsets usually settle after a month or so. The flushes can continue, but aren't normally a major issue. \n Want to know more? \n \n  NICE:\u00a0beta interferon and glatiramer acetate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  \n  NICE: teriflunomide for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis  \n  NICE: natalizumab for the treatment of adults with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis  \n  NICE: fingolimod for the treatment of highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis  \n  NICE:\u00a0alemtuzumab for treating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis  \n  NICE:\u00a0dimethyl fumarate for treating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis  \n \n Clinical trials \n Much\u00a0progress has been made in MS treatment\u00a0thanks to\u00a0clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones. \n All clinical trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they are worthwhile and safely conducted. Participants in clinical trials sometimes do better overall than those\u00a0in routine care. \n Speak to your care team if you're interested in taking part in a clinical trial. \n Complementary and alternative therapies for MS \n Some people with MS find that\u00a0 complementary therapies  help them feel better. Many complementary treatments and therapies claim to ease symptoms, although scientific evidence is often not clear about how effective they are. \n Many people think that complementary treatments have no harmful effects. However, people can\u00a0occasionally\u00a0experience problems, and it\u2019s not a good idea to use them as an alternative to medicines prescribed by your doctor. If you're considering using an alternative treatment alongside your prescribed medicines, it's important to let your doctor know your plans. \n Care and support \n If you find it difficult to look after yourself, your local authority may be able to provide you with some help. Ask for a care and support needs assessment. For more information, read about\u00a0 assessing your care and support needs .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It can be hard to tell whether your symptoms might be caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) at first, as some of the symptoms can be quite vague or similar to other conditions. \n See your GP if you think you have\u00a0 symptoms of MS . Letting them know about the type and pattern of symptoms you're experiencing\u00a0in detail will help them determine whether you\u00a0might have the condition. \n If your GP thinks you could have MS, you should see a neurologist\u00a0(a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment. \n Tests for MS \n Diagnosing MS is complicated because no single test can positively diagnose it. Other possible causes of your symptoms may need to be ruled out first. \n It may also not be possible to confirm a diagnosis if you have had only one \"attack\" of MS-like symptoms. A diagnosis can only be made with confidence once there's evidence of at least two separate attacks, although this may include signs of attacks on an MRI scan that you may not realise you have had. \n Some of the tests you may need to confirm MS are outlined below. \n Neurological examination \n Your neurologist will look for abnormalities, changes or weakness in your vision, eye movements, hand or leg strength, balance and co-ordination, speech and reflexes. \n These may show whether your nerves are damaged in a way that might suggest MS.\u00a0 \n Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \n A\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  is a painless scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. \n It\u00a0can show whether there's any damage or scarring of the myelin sheath (the layer surrounding your nerves) in your brain and spinal cord. Finding this can help confirm a diagnosis in most people with MS. \n A standard MRI scanner is like a large tube or tunnel. The machine is noisy and some people feel claustrophobic while the scan is done. Tell your neurologist if you're worried about this. \n Newer scanners are more open and work quicker than those used in the past, and most people have scans without any problems.\u00a0 \n Evoked potential test \n There are several types of evoked potential test. \n The most common type assesses how well the eyes work. Light patterns are shown to the eyes while your brainwaves are monitored using small, sticky patches called electrodes placed on your head. \n It's a painless test and can show whether it takes your brain longer than normal to receive messages. \n Lumbar puncture \n A\u00a0lumbar puncture is a procedure to remove a sample of your spinal fluid by inserting a needle into the lower back. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord, and changes in the fluid can suggest problems with the nervous system. \n The procedure is done under\u00a0 local anaesthetic , which means you'll be awake, but the area the needle goes in will be numbed. The sample is then tested for immune cells and antibodies, which is a sign that your immune system has been fighting a disease in your brain and spinal cord. \n Lumbar punctures are very safe, but are often uncomfortable and can cause a headache that occasionally lasts for up to a few days. \n A lumbar puncture will often be performed to provide extra information if your symptoms or scans are unusual. \n Blood tests \n  Blood tests \u00a0are usually performed to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or a very rare, but potentially very similar, condition called neuromyelitis optica. \n Determining the type of MS \n Once a diagnosis of MS has been made, your neurologist may be able to identify which type of MS you have. \n This will largely be based on: \n \n the pattern of your symptoms \u2013 such as whether you experience periods when your symptoms get worse (relapses) then improve (remissions), or whether they get steadily worse (progress) \n the results of an MRI scan \u2013 such as whether there\u2019s evidence that lesions in your nervous system have developed at different times and at different places in your body \n \n However, the type of MS you have often only becomes clear over time because the symptoms of MS are so varied and unpredictable. It can take a few years to make an accurate diagnosis of progressive MS, as the condition usually worsens slowly."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Multiple myeloma", "introduction": "Multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer. \n Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at\u00a0the centre of some\u00a0bones. It produces the body's blood cells. Multiple myeloma\u00a0affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow. \n Myeloma does not\u00a0usually take the form of\u00a0a lump or tumour. Instead, the myeloma cells divide and expand within the bone marrow, damaging the bones and affecting the production of healthy blood cells. \n Myeloma\u00a0often\u00a0affects many places in the body, which is why it is called multiple myeloma. Commonly affected areas include the spine, skull, pelvis and ribs. \n Signs and symptoms \n In the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It's often only suspected or diagnosed after\u00a0a routine blood or urine test. \n However, myeloma will eventually cause a wide range of\u00a0problems, including: \n \n a persistent dull ache or specific areas of tenderness in your bones \n weak bones that\u00a0break (fracture)\u00a0easily \n tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath (caused by\u00a0 anaemia ) \n repeated infections \n less commonly, bruising\u00a0and unusual bleeding \u2013 such as frequent  nosebleeds , bleeding gums and\u00a0heavy periods \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of multiple myeloma  \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you have any of the above symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to\u00a0get a\u00a0proper diagnosis. \n Your GP will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection, and any other symptoms that suggest you may have myeloma. \n They may also arrange\u00a0blood\u00a0and urine tests that can detect\u00a0abnormal proteins produced by myeloma cells. \n If myeloma is suspected, you will be\u00a0referred to a consultant haematologist (a specialist in blood conditions) for further tests and treatment. \n Read more about  diagnosing\u00a0multiple myeloma  \n Who is affected? \n Multiple myeloma is an\u00a0uncommon\u00a0type of cancer, with around 4,800 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK. \n It's not known exactly what causes the condition, although it's more common in: \n \n people with\u00a0monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood \n men \n adults over 60 \u2013\u00a0most cases are diagnosed at around the age of 70,\u00a0and cases affecting people under the age of 40 are rare \n black people\u00a0\u2013\u00a0multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations \n \n Read more about the  causes of multiple myeloma . \n How multiple myeloma is treated \n There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but treatment can often help control it for several years. \n Treatment will often involve: \n \n a\u00a0combination of anti-myeloma medications to\u00a0destroy the myeloma cells \n medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures\u00a0and anaemia \n anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer\u00a0when it comes back (relapses) \n \n As part of your treatment, you may be asked if you want to take part in a clinical trial\u00a0to help researchers develop better treatments for multiple myeloma. \n Read more about  treating multiple myeloma  \n Outlook \n The outlook for multiple myeloma is improving all the time, but the condition still can't be completely cured. Research is ongoing to try to find new and better treatments. \n As with other types of cancer, the outlook depends on\u00a0things such as your age and general health. Some people may live less than a year, while others may live 20 years or more. \n Overall, about 77\u00a0in every 100 people will live at least a year, 47 in every 100 will live at least five years, and 33\u00a0in every 100 will live at least 10 years. \n Support groups \n If you've been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, you may find it useful to\u00a0contact a local or national support group, such as  Myeloma UK . \n Support groups can offer more information and advice. They can also often put you in touch with other people in a similar situation so you can share advice and talk about your experiences. \n The\u00a0Myeloma UK website has more information about  how they can help you \u00a0and  finding a local support group .", "symptoms": "In the early stages, multiple myeloma may not cause any symptoms or complications, and may only be diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test. \n However, it will eventually cause a wide range of problems, some of which are outlined below. \n Bone pain \n Multiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones, most often the back, ribs or hips. The pain is\u00a0frequently a persistent dull ache,\u00a0which may be made worse by movement. \n Bone fractures and spinal cord compression \n Multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and ribs are most often affected. \n Fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back). \n Compression of the spinal cord can cause\u00a0pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels. \n Anaemia \n Multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells ( anaemia ). This can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment. \n If you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless. \n Repeated infections \n People with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness). \n You may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time. \n Raised calcium levels in the blood \n A high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream. \n Symptoms of hypercalcaemia can include extreme  thirst , feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently,  constipation , confusion and drowsiness. \n Unusual bleeding \n Bruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage)\u00a0\u2013 such as frequent  nosebleeds , bleeding gums and\u00a0heavy periods \u2013 sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made. \n Thickened blood \n In some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision,  headaches ,  dizziness , bleeding from the gums or nose, and  shortness of breath . \n Kidney problems \n Kidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. Abnormal proteins produced by\u00a0the cancer\u00a0cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. Some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also\u00a0cause kidney damage. \n Eventually, the kidneys may stop working properly. This is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure. Signs of kidney failure can include: \n \n weight loss\u00a0and poor appetite \n swollen ankles, feet or hands \n tiredness and a lack of energy \n shortness of breath \n itchy skin \n feeling sick \n \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you have symptoms of multiple myeloma. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. \n You should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia or kidney failure, as these are medical emergencies that need to be investigated and treated as soon as possible. \n Read more about  diagnosing multiple myeloma \u00a0and  treating multiple myeloma", "causes": "In multiple myeloma, cells inside the bone marrow called plasma cells become cancerous. \n Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body's blood cells. \n Plasma cells are normally produced in\u00a0a controlled way. In cases of multiple myeloma, large numbers of abnormal plasma cells are produced. These fill up the bone marrow and interfere with the production of other cells, such as red and white blood cells. \n The exact reason why this happens is unknown, but multiple myeloma is closely associated with a condition called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), and there are certain things that can increase your risk of developing it. \n Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) \n In almost all cases, multiple myeloma occurs in someone who previously had MGUS. \n MGUS is the name for having an excess number of protein molecules called immunoglobulins in your blood. This does not cause any symptoms and treatment is not required. \n However, every year around\u00a01 in every 100 people with MGUS go on to develop multiple myeloma. There is no known way to delay or prevent this, so\u00a0ongoing outpatient\u00a0tests to check for cancer will usually be recommended if you have MGUS. \n Other factors \n As well as MGUS, certain things can increase your risk of developing multiple myeloma, including: \n \n age \u2013 your risk of developing multiple myeloma increases as you get older; most cases are diagnosed at around the age of\u00a070, and cases affecting people under 40 are rare \n gender \u2013 men are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than women \n ethnicity \u2013 multiple myeloma is about twice as common in black populations compared with white and Asian populations \n \n It has also been suggested that having a family history of MGUS or multiple myeloma, having reduced immunity (for example, because of medication or  HIV ), being overweight or  obese , and being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals may increase your risk of multiple myeloma. However, a link between these factors and the condition is less clear.", "treatment": "If you have multiple myeloma, you will be cared for by a team, which is usually led by a consultant haematologist who specialises in myeloma. \n The team will discuss your condition and recommend the best treatment for you. However, the final decision will be yours. \n Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, it may be useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a particular treatment. \n There are two main aims in treating multiple myeloma: \n \n to bring the myeloma under control \n to prevent and treat problems associated with myeloma, such as\u00a0 anaemia  and bone pain \n \n While treatment can often control myeloma and improve quality of life, myeloma usually can't be cured. This means additional treatment is needed when the cancer comes back (a relapse). \n Not everyone diagnosed with myeloma will need immediate treatment if the condition is not causing any problems. This is sometimes referred to as asymptomatic, or  smouldering myeloma . \n If you don't need treatment, you will be monitored for signs the cancer is beginning to cause problems. If you do need treatment, the options outlined below are most commonly used. \n Bringing myeloma under\u00a0control \n The initial treatment for multiple myeloma may be either: \n \n non-intensive \u2013 for older or less fit patients (this is more common) \n intensive \u2013 for younger or fitter patients (thought to be too toxic for older or less fit patients) \n \n The decision about which treatment is appropriate for you is usually based on your biological age or fitness. \n As a general rule, people younger than 65 are more likely to be candidates for intensive therapy. For those over 70, non-intensive treatment is more likely to be recommended. \n Those aged in between will be given careful consideration as to what treatment group they fall into. \n Both non-intensive and intensive treatments involve taking a combination of anti-myeloma medicines. Intensive treatment involves much higher doses and is followed by a stem cell transplant. \n The medicines usually include a chemotherapy medicine, a steroid medicine, and either thalidomide or bortezomib. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy  medicines kill the myeloma cells. The most common types used to treat myeloma are melphalan and cyclophosphamide. \n These treatments are mostly taken in tablet form. They are reasonably well tolerated and side effects are mild. Possible side effects include: \n \n increased risk of infections \n feeling sick \n vomiting \n hair loss \n \n Your clinician will give you advice and information about your risk of developing potentially serious infections, and\u00a0tell you what you can do to reduce your risk of picking up infections during your treatment. \n Steroids \n Steroid medications ( corticosteroids )\u00a0help destroy myeloma cells and make chemotherapy more effective.\u00a0The two most common types used to treat myeloma are dexamethasone and\u00a0prednisolone. \n Steroids are taken orally (by mouth) after eating. Possible side effects include  heartburn ,  indigestion , increased appetite, mood changes and problems falling asleep. \n Thalidomide \n Thalidomide can help kill myeloma cells. You take\u00a0it as a tablet every day, usually\u00a0in the evening\u00a0as it can make you feel sleepy. \n Other common side effects include: \n \n  constipation \u00a0 \n  dizziness  \n rashes \n numbness or tingling in the hands and feet ( peripheral neuropathy ) \n \n Thalidomide can cause birth defects, so it should not be taken by pregnant women, and a reliable form of\u00a0 contraception  such as a  condom  must be used during treatment. \n There is also a risk you may develop a blood clot when taking thalidomide, so you may be given medication to help prevent this. Contact your care team immediately if you develop symptoms of a blood clot, such as pain or swelling in one of your legs, or  chest pain  and  breathlessness . \n Bortezomib \n Bortezomib (Velcade) can help kill myeloma cells by causing protein to build-up inside them. \n There are some limitations as to who can have bortezomib, but a member of your care team will discuss this with you. \n The medication is given by injection, usually under the skin.\u00a0Possible side effects include: \n \n tiredness \n nausea \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n numbness or tingling in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy) \n \n Stem cell transplant \n After initial therapy with primarily outpatient-based treatments, people receiving intensive treatment will be given a much higher dose of chemotherapy medication as an inpatient to potentially help destroy a larger number of myeloma cells. This aims to achieve a longer period of remission (where there is no sign of active disease in your body). \n However, these high doses also affect healthy bone marrow, so a\u00a0stem cell transplant\u00a0will be needed to help your bone marrow recover. \n In most cases, the stem cells will be collected from you before treatment (autologous transplantation). In rare cases, they are collected from a sibling or an unrelated donor. \n Treating relapses \n Further treatment is needed if myeloma returns. Treatment for relapses is generally similar to initial treatment, although non-intensive treatment is often preferred to further intensive treatment. \n Additional medications such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide and other chemotherapy medicines may be added, or used\u00a0again as your haematologist feels is appropriate. \n You may also be asked if you want to participate in clinical trial research into\u00a0new treatments for multiple myeloma. \n Lenalidomide and pomalidomide \n Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are similar to thalidomide. They're both taken by mouth, and both can\u00a0have an effect on the cells produced by your bone marrow, which can cause: \n \n increased risk of infection \u2013 as\u00a0a result of\u00a0a low number of white blood cells \n anaemia \u2013\u00a0caused by\u00a0a low number of red blood cells \n bruising and bleeding \u2013\u00a0because of\u00a0a low platelet count \n \n They may also increase your risk of developing a blood clot and have other side effects similar to thalidomide. \n Let your care team know if you experience any problems or unusual symptoms while taking lenalidomide or pomalidomide. \n Treating symptoms and complications of myeloma \n As well as the main treatments for multiple myeloma, you may also need treatment to help relieve some of the problems caused by the condition. \n For example: \n \n painkillers \u2013 may be given to reduce pain \n  radiotherapy \u00a0\u2013 may be used to relieve bone pain\u00a0or help healing after a bone is surgically repaired \n bisphosphonate medication \u2013 either\u00a0given as tablets or by injection, this may\u00a0help prevent bone damage and reduce the levels of calcium in your blood \n  blood transfusions  or\u00a0erythropoietin medication \u2013 may be used\u00a0to increase your red blood cell count and\u00a0treat anaemia \n surgery \u2013 may be carried out\u00a0to repair or strengthen damaged bones, or treat compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back) \n  dialysis \u00a0\u2013 may be\u00a0required if you develop kidney failure \n plasma exchange\u00a0\u2013 treatment to remove and replace a blood component called plasma may be carried out if you have unusually thick blood (hyperviscosity) \n \n These treatments can each cause side effects and complications, so make sure you discuss the potential risks and benefits with your treatment team beforehand. \n Clinical trials and research \n Research is ongoing to find new treatments for multiple myeloma and work out ways to improve the use of existing ones. To help with this, you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial\u00a0during your treatment. \n Clinical trials usually involve comparing a new treatment with an existing one to see whether the new treatment is more or less effective. \n It's important to remember, however, that if you are given a new treatment, there is no guarantee it will be more effective than an existing treatment. \n There will never be any pressure for you to take part in a trial if you do not want to. \n  Search clinical trials for multiple myeloma", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Multiple myeloma can be difficult to diagnose because it's an uncommon type of cancer that initially has few or no symptoms. \n Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms, medical history and overall health. During the examination, your GP will look for things such as bleeding, signs of infection and specific areas of bone tenderness. \n You may need urine and\u00a0 blood tests  to check for certain types of antibodies and proteins (immunoglobulins). \n If multiple myeloma is suspected,\u00a0you\u00a0will be\u00a0referred to a haematologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the blood) for further tests and\u00a0scans. \n Blood tests \n A number of blood tests are used to help diagnose multiple myeloma, and they may need to be repeated to monitor the condition. \n These may include: \n \n erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or plasma viscosity (PV) \u2013\u00a0if you have multiple myeloma, your ESR or PV will usually be raised \n tests to measure the type and number of abnormal antibodies produced by the cancerous plasma cells \n a full blood count (FBC) to check levels of different types of blood cells\u00a0\u2013 your doctor will be looking for a low number of red blood cells and platelets \n liver and kidney function \n blood calcium level \n \n Urine tests \n A urine sample will be checked for the abnormal proteins produced by the cancerous plasma cells. The abnormal proteins are known as monoclonal light chains,\u00a0or Bence Jones protein. \n These proteins can damage your kidneys as they pass through them from your blood to your urine. You may be asked to collect your urine over a 24-hour period. This will be used to check the quantity of proteins being produced and how well your kidneys are working. \n X-rays and other scans \n You will have\u00a0 X-rays \u00a0taken of your long bones (arms and legs), skull, spine and pelvis to look for any damage. \n Other scans, such as\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scans  and  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans , may also be carried out. \n Bone marrow biopsy \n A bone marrow\u00a0 biopsy  is usually needed to confirm multiple myeloma. A needle will be used to take a small sample of bone marrow from one of your bones, usually the pelvis. A sample of bone may also be removed. \n This is carried out using a\u00a0 local anaesthetic \u00a0(the area where the needle is inserted is numbed). \n The sample of bone marrow and bone will be used\u00a0to check for cancerous plasma cells."},

See your GP\u00a0or dentist if: \n \n your mouth ulcer has lasted three weeks \n you keep getting mouth ulcers \n your mouth ulcer becomes more painful or red\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this could be a sign of a bacterial infection, which may need treatment with  antibiotics  \n \n Mouth ulcers are also\u00a0a possible symptom of a viral infection that mainly affects young children, called hand, foot and mouth disease. Speak to your GP or call the NHS 24 '111' service\u00a0if you're unsure. \n Read about the\u00a0 symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease . \n How to treat mouth ulcers \n Mouth ulcers don\u2019t usually need to be treated, because they tend to clear up by themselves within a week or two. \n However,\u00a0treatment\u00a0can\u00a0help to reduce swelling and ease any discomfort. This may help if you keep getting mouth ulcers or your mouth ulcer affects eating and drinking. \n Self care \n Things you can do to speed up healing include: \n \n applying a protective paste recommended by your pharmacist \n using a soft toothbrush to brush your teeth \n using a toothpaste that doesn\u2019t contain sodium lauryl sulphate, as this may be irritating\u00a0 \n avoiding hard, spicy, salty, acidic or hot\u00a0food and drink\u00a0until the ulcer heals \n using a straw to drink cool drinks \n avoiding things that may be triggering your mouth ulcers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see causes, below \n \n Pharmacy medicines \n You can buy several types of mouth ulcer treatment from a pharmacy. Speak to your pharmacist about the best\u00a0treatment for you. Options include the following: \n \n Antimicrobial mouthwash may speed up healing and prevent infection of the ulcer. Children under two shouldn't use this treatment. It also contains chlorexidine gluconate, which may stain teeth \u2013 but this\u00a0may fade once treatment is finished.\u00a0 \n Painkillers are available as a mouthwash, lozenge, gel or spray. They can sting on first use\u00a0and your mouth may feel numb \u2013 but\u00a0this is temporary. Mouthwash can be diluted with water if stinging continues. Children under 12 shouldn\u2019t use mouthwash or gel. Mouthwash shouldn\u2019t be used for more than seven days in a row. \n Corticosteroid lozenges may reduce pain and speed up healing. These are best used as soon as the ulcer appears, but shouldn't be used\u00a0by children under 12. \n \n Medicines from your dentist or GP \n If necessary, you may be\u00a0prescribed\u00a0a course of stronger corticosteroids to help reduce pain and swelling, and speed up healing. \n Corticosteroids are available on prescription as tablets, mouthwash, paste or spray, but are not suitable\u00a0for children under 12. \n Is it\u00a0mouth cancer? \n In a few cases, a long-lasting mouth ulcer can be a sign of  mouth cancer . Ulcers caused by mouth cancer usually appear on or under the tongue, although you can get them in other areas of the mouth. \n Risk factors for mouth cancer include: \n \n smoking or using products that contain tobacco \n drinking alcohol \u2013 smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large \n infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV) \u2013 the virus that causes  genital warts  \n \n It's important to detect mouth cancer as early as possible. If mouth cancer is detected early, the chances of a complete recovery are good.  Regular dental check-ups \u00a0are the best way to detect the early signs. \n What causes mouth ulcers? \n In many cases, the reason for mouth ulcers is unclear. Most single mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the lining inside of the\u00a0mouth. For example: \n \n accidentally biting the inside of your cheek or a sharp tooth \n poorly fitting dentures \n hard food \n a defective filling \n \n It\u2019s not always clear what causes mouth ulcers that keep returning, but triggers are thought to include: \n \n stress and anxiety\u00a0 \n hormonal changes \u2013 some women develop mouth ulcers during their monthly period \n eating certain foods \u2013 such as chocolate, spicy foods, coffee, peanuts, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes and wheat flour \n toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate \n stopping smoking \u2013 when you first stop smoking, you may develop mouth ulcers \n \n Your genes are also thought to have a role\u00a0\u2013\u00a0around 40% of people who keep getting\u00a0mouth ulcers report that it runs in their family. \n Medical conditions \n Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medical conditions, such as: \n \n viral infections \u2013 including the  cold sore virus ,  chickenpox , and  hand, foot and mouth disease  \n  vitamin B12 \u00a0or\u00a0 iron deficiency  \n  Crohn's disease \u00a0\u2013 a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system \n  coeliac disease \u00a0\u2013 a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten \n  reactive arthritis \u00a0\u2013 a condition that causes inflammation in various places in the body, usually as a reaction to an infection \n weakened immune system \u2013 for example, due to  HIV  or  lupus  \n Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\u00a0\u2013 a rare and poorly understood condition that also\u00a0causes swelling of the blood vessels \n \n Medications and treatments \n Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medications or treatments, such as: \n \n non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2013 such as  ibuprofen  \n nicorandil \u2013 a medication sometimes used to treat angina \n  beta-blockers \u00a0\u2013 used to treat conditions such as angina, high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms \n a side effect of\u00a0 chemotherapy \u00a0or  radiotherapy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is known as mucositis \n \n Can mouth ulcers be prevented? \n It may not be possible to prevent mouth ulcers, because they're often caused by things you can't control (such as a family history or a medical condition). \n However, the following may help to reduce your risk of developing mouth ulcers: \n \n avoiding certain foods \u2013 such as chocolate, spicy foods, coffee, peanuts, almonds, strawberries, cheese, tomatoes and wheat flour, if they cause you to have an ulcer \n not chewing gum \n brushing your teeth with a soft-bristled brush, which may reduce irritation in your mouth \n using toothpaste that doesn\u2019t contain sodium lauryl sulphate \n reducing\u00a0 stress  and  anxiety \u00a0\u2013\u00a0which may be a trigger for some people \n \n Read more advice on\u00a0 dental health .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Mouth cancer", "introduction": "Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums. \n Tumours\u00a0can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common. \n Symptoms of mouth cancer\u00a0include: \n \n red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue \n  ulcers  \n a lump \n \n See your GP if these symptoms\u00a0do not heal within\u00a0three weeks, especially if you're a heavy drinker or smoker. \n Types of mouth cancer \n A cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer\u00a0starts in. \n Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer, accounting for nine out of 10 cases. Squamous cells are found in many places around the body, including the inside of the mouth and under the skin. \n Less common types of mouth cancer include: \n \n oral malignant melanoma \u2013 where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour \n adenocarcinomas \u2013 cancers that develop inside the salivary glands \n \n What causes mouth cancer? \n Mouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably. \n Risk factors\u00a0for developing mouth cancer include: \n \n smoking or using products that contain tobacco \n drinking alcohol \u2013 smokers who are also heavy drinkers have a much higher risk compared to the population at large \n infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV), the virus that causes  genital warts  \n \n Read more about the  causes of mouth cancer  \n Who is affected by mouth cancer? \n Mouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer, accounting for one in 50 of all cancer cases. \n In the UK, just over 6,767 new cases of mouth cancer were diagnosed in 2011 (the latest reliable data). \n Most cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are between 50-74 years of age. \n Mouth cancer can occur in younger adults, but it's thought that HPV infection may be responsible for the majority of cases that occur in younger people. \n Mouth cancer is more common in men than in women. This is thought to be due to the fact that, on average, men drink more alcohol than women. \n Treating mouth cancer \n There are three main treatment options for mouth cancer. They are: \n \n surgery \u2013 where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue \n  chemotherapy  \u2013 where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells \n  radiotherapy  \u2013 where high energy  X-rays  are used to kill cancerous cells \n \n These treatments are often used in combination. For example, a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be given after surgery to help prevent the cancer returning. \n Read more about  treating mouth cancer  \n Complications of mouth cancer \n Both surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult ( dysphagia ). \n Dysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration  pneumonia . \n Read more about the  complications of mouth cancer  \n Reducing the risk \n The three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing \u2013 or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment \u2013 are: \n \n not smoking \n keeping to the recommended weekly limits for alcohol consumption (21 units for men and 14 units for women (read more about  alcohol units ) \n eating a 'Mediterranean-style diet', with plenty of fresh vegetables (particularly tomatoes), citrus fruits, olive oil and fish (read more about  healthy eating ) \n \n It's also important that you have regular  dental check-ups  because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer. \n Outlook \n If mouth cancer is diagnosed early, a complete cure is often possible using a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. \n The outlook for mouth cancer can vary depending on which part of the mouth is affected and whether it has spread from the mouth into surrounding tissue. The outlook is much better if the cancer is diagnosed early. \n Overall, an estimated 40% of people with cancer affecting the mouth and pharyx will live at least five years after their diagnosis and many people live much longer. However, the outlook is better for cancer affecting certain areas of the mouth, such as the lip, tongue or oral cavity.", "symptoms": "Mouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat. \n The most common symptoms of mouth cancer include: \n \n red or white patches in the mouth or throat \n a lump \n  ulcers  \n \n Other symptoms may include: \n \n persistent pain in the mouth \n pain or difficulty when swallowing ( dysphagia ) \n changes in your voice, or speech problems \n swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck \n unexplained weight loss \n bleeding or numbness in the mouth \n a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason \n difficulty moving your jaw \n \n When to seek medical advice \n Many of the symptoms listed above can\u00a0be caused by less serious conditions, such as minor infections. \n But it's strongly recommended that you visit your GP if any of the symptoms listed above have lasted for more than three weeks. It's especially important to seek medical advice if you're a heavy drinker or smoker. \n Dental check-ups \n Mouth cancer tends not to cause any noticeable symptoms during the initial stages of the disease. \n This is why it is important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination. \n You should have a dental check-up at least every year. However, more frequent check-ups may be recommended if you have a history of\u00a0 tooth decay  or  gum disease .", "causes": "The two leading causes of mouth cancer in the UK are drinking too much alcohol and smoking. \n Both alcohol and tobacco are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to  cancer . \n The risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker. \n Exactly what triggers the changes in DNA that lead to mouth cancer and why only a small number of people develop mouth cancer is still uncertain. \n How mouth cancer spreads \n There are two ways mouth cancer can spread: \n \n directly \u2013 the cancer can spread out of the mouth and into nearby tissues, such as surrounding skin or into the back of the jaw \n via the lymphatic system \u2013\u00a0the lymphatic system is a series of glands\u00a0found throughout your body which\u00a0produce many specialised cells needed by your immune system to fight infection \n \n Mouth cancer that spreads to another part of the body is known as metastatic oral cancer. \n Other risk factors \n Other\u00a0risk factors for mouth cancer may\u00a0include: \n \n chewing tobacco or other smokeless tobacco products like snus \n chewing\u00a0betel nuts with or without tobacco \n a poor diet \n the human papilloma virus (HPV) \n poor oral hygiene \n \n Smokeless tobacco \n There is a range of smokeless tobacco products including: \n \n chewing tobacco \n snuff \u2013 powdered tobacco designed to be snorted \n snus \u2013 a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip \n \n Smokeless tobacco products are not harmless and many increase your risk of developing mouth cancer, as well as other cancers, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer and oesophageal cancer. \n Betel nuts \n Betel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian ethnic communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin. \n They have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco. \n Due to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large. \n Diet \n There is evidence that a poor diet may increase your risk of some types of mouth cancer. \n A healthy, balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is thought to reduce your risk of developing mouth cancer. \n Human papilloma virus (HPV) \n The human papilloma virus (HPV) is a family of viruses that affect the skin and\u00a0moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat. \n You can contract an HPV infection by having sexual contact with a person already infected \u2013 you do not have to have 'full sex'; just close skin-to-skin contact. \n There is evidence that in rare cases,\u00a0certain types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth inside the mouth, triggering mouth cancer. \n Poor oral hygiene \n There is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having  tooth decay ,  gum disease , not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer.", "treatment": "Your treatment will depend on the type and size of the cancer, the grade and how far it's spread \u2013 as well as your general health. \n Your treatment plan \n If the cancer hasn't spread beyond the mouth or the oropharynx (the bit of your throat at the back of your mouth), a complete cure may be possible using a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. \n If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, then a cure is unlikely but it will be possible to slow the progress of the cancer and help relieve symptoms by using surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. \n Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your care team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours. \n Before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, what are the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments. \n Before treatment begins \n Radiotherapy makes the teeth more sensitive and vulnerable to infection so before treatment begins, you'll be given a full dental examination and any necessary work will be carried out. \n If you smoke or drink, stopping will increase the chances of your treatment being successful. \n Your specialist nurse and your GP can provide help and support if you are finding it difficult to quit smoking and drinking. \n Read more about  quitting smoking  and  cutting down on alcohol  \n Surgery \n For mouth cancer, the aim of surgical treatment is to remove any affected tissue while minimising damage to the rest of the mouth. \n Photodynamic therapy (PDT) \n If the cancer is in its very early stages, it may be possible to remove any tumours using a type of laser surgery known as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves taking a medicine that makes your tissue sensitive to the effects of light. A laser is then used to remove the tumour. \n Other forms of surgery \n If your cancer is more advanced, it may be necessary to remove part of your mouth lining and, in some cases, facial skin, which can be replaced using skin grafted from your forearm or chest. \n If your tongue is affected, part of the tongue will have to be removed. This is known as a partial glossectomy. The tongue is then reconstructed using grafted tissue. \n If the cancer has spread to your jawbone it will need to be surgically removed. The jawbone can be replaced by taking bone from another part of your body and grafting it in place. \n Occasionally, other bones, such as cheekbones, may have to be removed to completely remove the cancer. \n These can be replaced with plastic prosthetic bones which are are usually very realistic, leaving your physical appearance largely unaffected. \n During surgery, your surgeon may also remove lymph nodes near the site of the initial tumour. This is often done as a preventative measure in case they contain small numbers of cancerous cells that can't be detected. \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy  uses doses of radiation to kill cancerous cells. It may be possible to remove the cancer using radiotherapy alone, but it is usually used after surgery to prevent the cancer from reocurring. \n The treatment is normally given every day over the course of three to seven weeks, depending on the size of the cancer and how far it has spread. \n While it kills cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also affect healthy tissue, and it has a number of side effects, including: \n \n sore, red skin (like sunburn) \n  mouth ulcers \u00a0 \n sore mouth and throat \n dry mouth \n loss of, or changes in taste \n loss of appetite \n tiredness\u00a0 \n feeling sick \n stiff jaw \n bad breath\u00a0 \n \n Any side effects will be monitored by your care team and treated where possible. \n The side effects of radiotherapy can be distressing, but most of them will pass once the radiotherapy is complete. \n Internal radiotherapy \n Internal radiotherapy \u2013 also called brachytherapy \u2013 is often used to treat cancers of the tongue that are in their early stages. It involves placing radioactive implants directly into the tumour while you are under a general anaesthetic. \n They will be left for between one and eight days during which time the cancer cells will receive a much higher dose of radiation than the rest of your mouth. \n Visits by friends and family will need to be restricted due to radiation and pregnant women and children won't be able to visit you. \n The radioactive implants will cause your mouth to become swollen, and you will experience some pain five to 10 days after the implants are removed. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy  is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy when the cancer is widespread, or if it is thought there is a significant risk of the cancer returning. \n Chemotherapy involves the use of powerful cancer-killing medicines. These medicines damage the DNA of the cancerous cells, interrupting their ability to reproduce. \n Medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. Adverse side effects are common and include: \n \n fatigue (tiredness) \n sore mouth \n mouth ulcers \n feeling sick \n  being sick   \n hair loss \n tiredness \n \n The side effects should stop once the treatment has finished. \n Chemotherapy also weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to infection. \n Cetuximab \n Cetuximab is a new type of medication, known as a biologic, used to treat advanced cases of mouth cancer. It is usually used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. \n Cetuximab targets proteins on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors. These receptors help the cancer to grow, so by targeting these proteins, cetuximab prevents the cancer from spreading. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ruled that cetuximab did not represent a cost-effective treatment in most cases and has recommended it only be used in people who: \n \n are in a good state of health (likely to make a good recovery if treated) \n are unable to have chemotherapy for medical reasons (for example, because they have kidney disease or are pregnant)", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have symptoms of mouth cancer, your GP will carry out a physical examination and ask about your symptoms. \n If mouth cancer is suspected, you will be referred to hospital for further tests or to speak to a specialist head and neck surgeon. \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of mouth cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected mouth cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n Biopsy \n It may be necessary to remove a small sample of affected tissue to check for the presence of cancerous cells. This procedure is known as a  biopsy . \n There are three main methods used to carry out a biopsy in cases of suspected mouth cancer. \n Punch biopsy \n A punch biopsy may be used if the suspected affected area of tissue is in an easily accessible place, such as your tongue or the inside of your mouth. \n The area is first injected with a local anaesthetic to numb it. The doctor will then cut away a small section of affected tissue and remove it with tweezers. \n The procedure is not painful, but can feel a little uncomfortable. \n Fine needle aspiration (FNA) \n A fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a type of biopsy used if it is suspected\u00a0a swelling in your neck is the result of mouth cancer. \n Your neck is numbed and a\u00a0needle is used\u00a0to draw out a small sample of tissue and fluids from the lump. The sample is then\u00a0checked for cancerous cells. \n FNA is not painful but\u00a0it can be uncomfortable and cause bruising. \n Panendoscopy \n A\u00a0panendoscope is used if the suspected tissue is at the back of your throat or inside one of your nasal cavities. \n This is a long thin tube\u00a0with a\u00a0camera and a light\u00a0which\u00a0is guided through\u00a0the nose, then used to remove a small section of tissue for the biopsy. \n The panendoscope can also check whether cancer has spread from your mouth to further down your throat, such as your larynx (voice box), oesophagus (gullet) or trachea (windpipe). \n Further tests \n If the biopsy confirms cancer you will need further tests to check what stage it has reached. \n If the cancer is diagnosed late it can have spread from your mouth into the lymphatic system \u2013 a series of glands throughout your body which produce many of the specialised cells needed by your immune system. \n Once the cancer reaches the lymphatic system, it is capable of spreading to any other part of your body, including your bones, blood and organs. \n However, it's uncommon for mouth cancer to spread further than the lymph nodes near your mouth, although in some cases it may also spread to surrounding bones, such as the jaw bone, and in some cases your lungs. \n Therefore, the tests will examine your lymph nodes, bones and the tissue near the site of your initial tumour to check for the presence of other tumours. \n These tests may include: \n \n an  X-ray  \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan   \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan   \n a  positron emission tomography (PET) scan  \n \n Further biopsies on nearby lymph nodes may also be carried out. \n Staging and grading \n Once these tests have been completed it should be possible to tell what stage and grade your cancer is: \n \n staging is a measure of how far the cancer has spread \n the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how fast it is likely to spread in future \n \n This will help determine whether you have: \n \n early mouth cancer (usually curable) \n intermediate mouth cancer (may be curable) \n or advanced mouth cancer (not usually curable, but it is usually possible to slow the spread of the cancer and extend lifespan) \n \n There are three grades of mouth cancer: low-grade (the slowest), moderate-grade and high-grade (the most aggressive). \n Grading your cancer helps the doctor decide how quickly you need to be treated \u2013 read more about  treating mouth cancer ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Motor neurone disease (MND)", "introduction": "Motor neurone disease is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting. \n Motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), occurs when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord called motor neurones stop working properly. This is known as neurodegeneration. \n Motor neurones control important muscle activity, such as: \n \n gripping \n walking \n speaking \n swallowing \n breathing \n \n As the condition progresses, people with motor neurone disease will find some or all of these activities increasingly difficult. Eventually, they may become impossible. \n It's not clear what causes motor neurones to stop working properly. In about 5% of cases there's a family history of either motor neurone disease or a related condition called frontotemporal dementia. This is known as familial motor neurone disease. In most of these cases, faulty genes have been identified as making a major contribution to the development of the condition. \n There's no single test to diagnose motor neurone disease and diagnosis is based mainly on the opinion of a brain and nervous system\u00a0specialist (a neurologist). The diagnosis of motor neurone disease is usually clear to an experienced neurologist, but sometimes specialised tests are needed to rule out other conditions with similar features. \n Read more about the  causes of motor neurone disease  and  diagnosing motor neurone disease  \n Progression of symptoms \n The  symptoms of motor neurone disease  begin gradually over weeks and months, usually on one side of the body initially, and get progressively worse. Common early symptoms include: \n \n a weakened grip, which can cause difficulty picking up or holding objects \n weakness at the shoulder that makes lifting the arm difficult \n a \"foot drop\" caused by weak ankle muscles \n dragging of the leg \n slurred speech (dysarthria) \n \n The condition isn't usually painful. \n As damage progresses, symptoms spread to other parts of the body and the condition becomes more debilitating. \n Eventually, a person with motor neurone disease may be unable to move. Communicating, swallowing and breathing may also become very difficult. \n In up to 15% of cases, motor neurone disease is associated with a type of dementia that can affect personality and behaviour. This is called frontotemporal dementia,\u00a0and is often an early feature when it occurs in motor neurone disease. The affected person may not realise that their personality or behaviour is different. \n Who's affected by motor neurone disease? \n Motor neurone disease is a rare condition that affects around two in every 100,000 people in the UK each year. There are about 5,000 people living with the condition in the UK at any one time. \n The condition can affect adults of all ages, including teenagers, although this is extremely rare. It's usually diagnosed in people over 40, but most people with the condition first develop symptoms in their 60s. It affects slightly more men than women. \n Treating motor neurone disease \n There's currently no cure for motor neurone disease. Treatment aims to: \n \n make the person feel comfortable and have the best quality of life possible \n compensate for the progressive loss of bodily functions such as mobility, communication, swallowing and breathing \n \n For example, a breathing mask can greatly help the symptoms of breathing and weakness, and a feeding tube (called a gastrostomy) helps maintain nutrition and overall comfort.\u00a0If necessary, medication can be used to help control excessive drooling. \n A medication called riluzole has shown a very small improvement in patients' overall survival, but it isn't a cure and doesn't stop the condition progressing. \n Read more about  treating motor neurone disease  \n Survival rates \n Motor neurone disease is a severely life-shortening condition for most people. Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is three years from the start of symptoms. However, some people may live for up to 10 years, and in rarer circumstances even longer. \n Living with motor neurone disease is extremely challenging and often a terrifying possibility before the diagnosis is made. However,\u00a0it's not necessarily as bleak as people imagine. \n With strong community and specialist support, many people can maintain some independence for a significant part of the condition's course, and experience a quality of life they may not have imagined was possible at the time of their diagnosis. \n The end of life for someone with motor neurone disease isn't usually distressing and is most often in their own home. In most cases, a person with the condition will die in their sleep\u00a0as the end stage of gradual weakness in their breathing muscles. Although some people with the condition will\u00a0have swallowing problems, they won't choke to death. \n Advice and support \n The  Motor Neurone Disease Scotland \u00a0is the leading Scottish charity for people affected by the condition. \n MND Scotland can give you information, practical advice and support about living with motor neurone disease and coping with the emotional impact of being diagnosed. \n Information about you \n If you have\u00a0motor neurone disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register", "symptoms": "The initial symptoms of motor neurone disease often affect certain areas of the body before eventually becoming more widespread. \n It's important to visit your GP as soon as possible if you have the typical early symptoms of motor neurone disease. There's evidence that specialist care can improve overall survival. \n The symptoms usually follow a pattern that falls into three stages: \n \n the initial stage \n the advanced stage \n the end stage \n \n Initial symptoms \n The initial symptoms of motor neurone disease usually develop slowly and subtly over time. It can be easy to mistake early symptoms for those of several unrelated conditions that affect the nervous system. \n Limb-onset disease \n In about two-thirds of people with motor neurone disease, the first symptoms occur in the arm or leg. This is sometimes called limb-onset disease. These symptoms include: \n \n a weakened grip, which can cause difficulties picking up or holding objects \n weakness at the shoulder, making lifting the arm above the head difficult \n tripping up over a foot because of weakness at the ankle or hip \n \n These symptoms are usually painless and may be accompanied by widespread twitching of the muscles (fasciculations) or muscle cramps, and there may be visible wasting of the muscles with significant weight loss. \n Bulbar-onset disease \n In a quarter of cases, problems initially affect the muscles used for speech and swallowing. Increasingly slurred speech (dysarthria) is usually the first sign of this type of motor neurone disease, and may be misdiagnosed as a  stroke . \n As the condition progresses, it may become increasingly difficult to swallow (dysphagia),\u00a0and be misdiagnosed as a blockage in the throat. \n Respiratory-onset disease \n In extremely rare cases, motor neurone disease starts by affecting the lungs, rather than affecting them at the end of the condition. This is called respiratory-onset disease. \n In some cases the initial symptoms are obvious, such as breathing difficulties and shortness of breath. \n In other cases the symptoms are less noticeable, such as waking up frequently during the night because the brain is temporarily starved of oxygen when lying down. This can make the person feel very tired and unrefreshed the next morning, sometimes with a headache. \n Advanced symptoms \n As motor neurone disease becomes more advanced, the differences between the various types of disease are less noticeable as more parts and functions of the body are affected. The rate at which the condition spreads varies, but generally remains the same for an individual (that is, it doesn't speed up, but doesn't slow down either). \n Muscular symptoms \n The\u00a0limbs become gradually weaker and the muscles in the limbs may appear progressively wasted. As a result, the person will find it increasingly difficult to move the affected limbs. \n The muscles may also become stiff. This is known as spasticity. Both muscle wasting and stiffness can also cause joint aches and pains. \n Speaking and swallowing difficulties \n At least two-thirds of people with motor neurone disease find that speaking and swallowing become increasingly difficult as the condition progresses. However, although choking episodes can be distressing they aren't the cause of death. \n Saliva problems \n Reduced swallowing can cause an excess of\u00a0saliva, sometimes with drooling. Thicker saliva may sometimes be difficult to clear from the chest or throat due to weakening of the muscles that control coughing. \n Excessive yawning \n Some people with motor neurone disease have episodes of uncontrollable, excessive yawning, even when they're not tired. This can sometimes cause jaw pain. \n Emotional changes \n Motor neurone disease can lead to changes in a person's ability to control their emotions, particularly\u00a0when there's weakness in the muscles that control speech and swallowing. \n One of the most common signs is when a person has episodes of sudden uncontrollable crying or, more rarely, laughter. Doctors may call this emotional lability or emotionality. \n Changes to mental abilities \n Occasionally, people with motor neurone disease may have significant difficulties with concentration,\u00a0planning and use of language. This is known as cognitive change and overlaps with a condition called frontotemporal dementia. \n The changes are usually quite subtle, making it difficult to tell them apart from the normal ageing process, and they don't normally affect a person's capacity to make their own decisions. \n Up to 15% of people\u00a0with motor neurone disease develop more profound frontotemporal dementia, usually soon after, or sometimes before,\u00a0their first muscle-related symptoms.\u00a0The affected person may not be aware that there are problems with their behaviour or personality. \n Breathing difficulties \n As the nerves and muscles that help control the lungs become progressively more damaged,\u00a0the person's breathing will become less efficient. \n This may be a feeling of being very short of breath after doing everyday tasks, such as walking up the stairs. However, over time, the person may even become short of breath when they're resting. \n Shortness of breath may be particularly troublesome at night. Some people find it difficult to breathe when they're lying down. Others may wake up in the night because of\u00a0breathlessness. \n As motor neurone disease progresses, a non-invasive breathing mask may be recommended at night to improve sleep quality and help reduce drowsiness during the day. \n End-stage symptoms \n As motor neurone disease progresses to its final phase, a person with the condition will probably experience: \n \n increasing body\u00a0paralysis, which means they'll need help with most daily activities \n significant shortness of breath \n \n Eventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won't be enough to compensate for the loss of normal lung function. At this stage, most people with motor neurone disease become increasingly drowsy before falling into a deep sleep, where\u00a0they usually die peacefully. \n Secondary symptoms \n Some people with motor neurone disease have additional symptoms that aren't directly caused by the condition but are related to the stress of living with it. These may include  depression ,\u00a0 insomnia \u00a0and  anxiety . \n Although many people with motor neuron disease may think about ending their life at some point, this isn't a common outcome, particularly with strong family and community support.", "causes": "Motor neurone disease occurs when specialist nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brain and spinal cord progressively lose their function. It's not clear why this happens. \n In most cases, a person with motor neurone disease won't\u00a0have a family history of the condition.\u00a0This is known as sporadic motor neurone disease. Researchers believe that the cause is probably a\u00a0series of steps involving a mixture of damaging genetic and environmental factors.\u00a0As we get older, we may gradually lose the ability to keep this damage under control, triggering irreversible neurodegeneration. \n About 5% of people with motor neurone disease have a close family relative with the condition or a related condition known as frontotemporal dementia. This is called familial motor neurone disease which can be hereditary or\u00a0linked to a problem with genes\u00a0that can cause problems at a younger age. \n Possible causes of motor neurone disease \n It's still unclear why the motor neurones begin to lose function. Most experts believe that it's a combination of interrelated factors that ultimately affect either the motor neurones or the nerve cells that support them. \n Aggregates and RNA processing \n Aggregates are abnormal clumps of protein that develop inside motor neurones. They are found in nearly all cases of motor neurone disease and may disrupt the normal working of the motor neurones, or at least be a marker that the cell is under great strain. \n The most common aggregate found is TDP-43, which is a very important protein involved in the correct processing of the genetic instructions for the cell through a molecule known as RNA. \n Cell transport disruption \n All cells contain transport systems that move nutrients and other chemicals into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Research suggests that the transport systems in motor neurones become disrupted. Over time, toxic waste can build up in cells as a natural by-product of normal cell activity. \n The body gets rid of the toxic waste by producing substances known as antioxidants, and packaging the waste into containers called microvesicles. Research suggests that in motor neurone disease the motor neurones may be deficient in antioxidants. However, there's no evidence that this is due to poor dietary intake. \n Glial cells \n Glia are cells that surround and support motor neurones and provide them with nutrients. Glial cells also help relay information from one nerve cell to another. \n   Some cases of motor neurone disease may be caused by problems with the glial cells, which means that the motor neurones no longer receive the support and nutrition they need to function normally. \n Glutamate \n Nerve cells use special \"messenger chemicals\" called neurotransmitters to pass information from one cell to another. One of the neurotransmitters is called glutamate. There's evidence that the motor neurones in people with motor neurone disease may have become more sensitive to glutamate, resulting in damage to these cells. However, this isn't linked to dietary intake of glutamate. \n Mitochondria \n Mitochondria are the \"batteries\" of cells. They provide the energy that a cell needs to carry out its normal function. Research has shown that the mitochondria in the motor neurones of people with motor neurone disease seem to become abnormal. \n Familial motor neurone disease \n The fact that motor neurone disease can run in families suggests that single genetic mutations inherited from parents may sometimes have a much larger role in the condition. \n A genetic mutation occurs when the instructions carried in cells become scrambled in some way. This results in one or more of the body's processes not working properly.\u00a0 \n Four major genetic mutations have so far been identified in the 5% of people with a family history of motor neurone disease or the related condition, frontotemporal dementia. \n The largest group (about one third) have an expanded area of a gene called C9ORF72. Some people with this gene abnormality develop motor neurone disease, some develop frontotemporal dementia and some develop both. Other genes linked to familial motor neurone disease include SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. \n If your father, mother, sister or brother developed motor neurone disease and were found to have one of these abnormal genes, you have a 50% chance of carrying the same gene. However, importantly, this doesn't necessarily mean you'll definitely develop\u00a0motor neurone disease\u00a0in your lifetime. \n If you've been diagnosed with\u00a0motor neurone disease but there's no wider family history, the overall risk to your own children is currently thought to be similar to that of the general population. \n Genetic testing is available to determine whether you have one of the mutated genes associated with familial motor neurone disease. Your GP can give you more information about appropriate specialists who can help with the complex issue of when to perform genetic testing.", "treatment": "There's no cure for motor neurone disease, but treatment can help relieve symptoms and help to slow down the condition's progression. \n Your care team \n If you're diagnosed with motor neurone disease, you'll be introduced to a team of healthcare professionals who'll be involved in your care. This team is often called a multidisciplinary team and typically includes a neurologist (or palliative care physician) and a\u00a0specialist nurse. \n Advance decision \n An important principle of medical care is that patients feel in charge of what is, and what isn't, done to them. Many people with motor neurone disease draw up an advance decision\u00a0(sometimes called an advanced directive). This is where you make your treatment preferences known in advance in case you can't communicate your decisions later because you're too ill. \n Issues that can be covered by an advance decision include: \n \n whether you want to be treated at home, in a hospice or in a hospital once you reach the final stages of motor neurone disease \n the type of medication you'd be willing to take in certain circumstances \n whether you'd be willing to consider a feeding tube if you were no longer able to swallow food and liquid \n if you have respiratory failure (loss of lung function) in the latter stages of motor neurone disease, whether you wish to be resuscitated by artificial means, such as having a permanent breathing tube inserted into your throat (known as a tracheostomy) \n whether you'd be willing to donate any of your organs after you die (the brain and spinal cord of people with motor neurone disease are very important for ongoing research) \n \n Your care team will be able to provide you with more information and\u00a0advice about making an advance decision. \n Read more about  end of life care  \n Riluzole \n Riluzole\u00a0is the only medication that's shown a survival benefit for people with motor neurone disease. Riluzole is thought to slow down the progressive damage to the motor neurone cells by reducing their sensitivity to the nerve transmitter glutamate. \n In medical research, riluzole extended survival by two to three months on average, although this varied from person to person and the condition continued to progress even with riluzole treatment. \n Side effects of riluzole are usually mild and commonly include nausea, tiredness and, less commonly, a rapid heartbeat. \n Very rarely, riluzole has been known to cause liver damage. If you're prescribed riluzole you'll need to have  blood tests \u00a0for the first few months to check your liver is working properly. If you've had significant liver disease, riluzole may not be suitable for you. \n Treating symptoms \n A\u00a0range of treatments\u00a0can relieve many of the symptoms of motor neurone disease and improve your quality of life. \n Muscle cramps \n Muscle cramps can be helped by physiotherapy\u00a0and, in some cases, a medication called quinine. They typically improve later in the condition. \n Quinine can cause side effects, such as: \n \n hearing and\u00a0vision problems \n  tinnitus \u00a0\u2013 the perception of noise in one ear, both ears or inside the head \n  vertigo \u00a0\u2013 a sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Because of this, quinine will usually only be used if the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. \n Muscle stiffness \n Muscle stiffness, also known as spasticity, can be treated using medication such as baclofen to help relax the muscles. Side effects may include increased weakness or tiredness. \n Drooling \n Drooling of watery saliva can be treated with a number of medications. One widely used medication is a hyoscine hydrobromide skin patch. It was originally designed to treat motion sickness, but has since proved useful in drying up the flow of saliva. \n Amitriptyline, atropine eye drops applied to the tongue, glycopyrrolate, or botulinum toxin injections are alternative medicines that can also be used to control drooling. \n Communication difficulties \n Not everyone with motor neurone disease will have significant speech problems, but there's a lot of help for people who do. A speech and language therapist can teach you several techniques to make your voice as clear as possible. \n As motor neurone disease progresses, you may need assistive technology to help you\u00a0communicate. A range of communication aids is available. Your therapist will be able to advise you about the most effective communication aids for you. \n Swallowing difficulties \n Not everyone with motor neurone disease will have significant swallowing problems (dysphagia). For those that do, it can prevent normal eating and drinking. If food goes down the wrong way into the lungs it can cause chest infections (called aspiration). Weight loss due to poor nutrition can also accelerate motor neurone disease. \n One widely used treatment for dysphagia is a thin feeding tube known as a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The tube is surgically implanted into your stomach through a small cut on the surface of the stomach. It shouldn't restrict your daily activities and you can continue to bathe and swim normally if you wish. It's advisable to have the tube inserted before the breathing muscles are significantly weakened, even if it isn't used for feeding until sometime later. \n Pain relief \n Motor neurone disease isn't usually a painful condition. If you experience pain, it's often aching joints caused by muscle weakness or a change in posture. The type of painkiller recommended will depend on how severe the pain is. \n Mild to moderate pain can often be controlled using  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen . More severe pain is very rare, but it can be treated using an opiate-based painkiller such as morphine. \n In some cases, a type of medication called gabapentin is used. It was originally designed to treat  epilepsy  but it's also useful\u00a0for treating pain. Drowsiness is a typical side effect of gabapentin. \n Breathing difficulties \n As motor neurone disease progresses, the muscles that help you breathe will become weaker and your breathing will become increasingly shallow, with a weaker cough. \n Breathing difficulties usually develop gradually, although rarely they may be the first sign of motor neurone disease. \n It's important to discuss breathing problems with your GP before they occur. Your GP or neurologist should be able to refer you to a respiratory specialist or a palliative care specialist, as appropriate. \n Many people with motor neurone disease benefit from non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) to support their breathing, usually overnight when asleep. Room air (not oxygen) is sucked into a small box, filtered and then gently pumped into the lungs through a face mask or nasal tube each time the person takes a breath. \n NIV may not be suitable for everyone with motor neurone disease. Your respiratory or palliative care specialist will be able to discuss the options available to you. \n Deciding what treatment you want to use in the event of respiratory failure is an important part of drawing up a treatment plan and making an advance decision. This can be a very difficult and upsetting decision, and you may want to discuss it with your loved ones. \n Your care team can also give you information and advice but the final decision will be yours. \n Complementary therapies \n Some people with motor neurone disease find  complementary therapy  helpful. This involves combining conventional treatments with non-medical treatments, such as acupuncture. \n Complementary therapies can't slow the progression of motor neurone disease, but they may help reduce stress and make your daily life more comfortable. \n Before considering complementary therapy, you should seek advice from your treatment team and ensure that any practitioners you contact are appropriately registered, qualified and experienced. \n Advice for carers \n Caring for someone with motor neurone disease can be both physically and emotionally demanding, and it's likely you'll need a wide range of support. \n For information and advice about all aspects of caring, visit\u00a0 Care Information Scotland", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you experience the initial  symptoms of motor neurone disease , such as a progressive, usually painless, weakness of grip. \n After an initial examination, they may refer you to a brain and nervous system specialist (a neurologist) for a further opinion and possibly tests. \n Diagnosing motor neurone disease can be difficult during the condition's initial stages because many of the\u00a0early symptoms can be caused by other more common health conditions such as: \n \n a\u00a0trapped nerve \u2013 wear and tear of the bones in the spine can sometimes cause nerves to become trapped and compressed under the spine \n  peripheral neuropathy \u00a0\u2013 where part of the nervous system becomes damaged by another health condition, most commonly  type 2 diabetes  \n \n Initial testing \n Motor neurone disease is usually diagnosed by a neurologist based on the symptoms and a physical examination. \n There's no single test for motor neurone disease, but the diagnosis is often obvious from a person\u2019s symptoms and physical examination by a neurologist. Various tests may be used to rule out other possible causes of the person's symptoms if they seem likely. Tests may include: \n \n  blood tests \u00a0\u2013 these can be used for several reasons, such as checking that certain organs, such as your thyroid, are working normally, or to look for a marker of muscle weakness (creatinine kinase) \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013 to give a detailed image of the inside of your brain and spinal cord \n electromyography (EMG) \u2013 measures the electrical activity in your muscles, which shows how well your motor neurones are working and connecting to the muscles \n nerve conduction test \u2013 similar to an EMG but measures how quickly your nerves can conduct an electrical signal \n  lumbar puncture \u00a0\u2013 a sample of spinal fluid may be removed for testing to exclude an inflammatory nerve condition\u00a0 \n muscle  biopsy  \u2013 in rare cases, a small sample of muscle may be removed for testing to determine whether the problem lies in the muscles or nerves \n \n Confirming the diagnosis \n There are many reasons why there may be delays in diagnosis. It may be that the initial symptoms aren't thought to be serious, or they're not recognised as being related to the nervous system so a neurologist isn't initially consulted. \n Sometimes, the diagnosis of motor neurone disease is clear without the need for further tests. However, confirming a diagnosis can sometimes be time-consuming even for an experienced neurologist, who occasionally needs a period of observation to be sure, particularly in cases where the condition progresses slowly. Motor neurone disease can only be diagnosed if the symptoms are clearly getting worse (progressive). \n Receiving the diagnosis \n Being told you have motor neurone disease can be emotionally devastating and the news can be difficult to take in at first. Many people diagnosed with the condition go through the classic stages of the grieving process. These are: \n \n denial \u2013 you may initially disbelieve the diagnosis and think there's nothing wrong with you or that your doctor has missed another diagnosis \n anger \u2013 you may feel angry towards friends, family or medical staff, particularly if you feel that the diagnosis has been unduly delayed \n bargaining \u2013 people with terminal conditions sometimes try to \"bargain\" with their doctors, asking for any sort of treatment that can prolong their life \n depression \u2013 you may lose interest in life and feel that your situation is hopeless \n acceptance \u2013 you come to terms with the diagnosis, the feelings of depression pass, and you begin to plan the rest of your life \n \n If you've been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, talking to a counsellor or a trained clinical psychologist may help combat feelings of  depression  and  anxiety . \n It's not unusual to have thoughts of taking your own life, although very few people with motor neurone disease go on to do this. You shouldn't be concerned about discussing any such thoughts with your doctor.\u00a0 \n Taking  antidepressants  or medicines to reduce anxiety may also help as you move through the stages of the grieving process. Your care team will be able to advise you about this."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Miscarriage", "introduction": "A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy during the first 23 weeks. \n The\u00a0main sign\u00a0of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding, which may be followed by cramping and pain in your lower abdomen. \n If you have vaginal bleeding, contact your GP or midwife. Most GPs can refer you to an early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away if necessary. You may be referred to a maternity ward if your pregnancy is at a later stage. \n However, bear in mind that light vaginal bleeding is relatively common during the first trimester of pregnancy (the first 12 weeks) and doesn't necessarily mean you're having a miscarriage. \n Read more about the  symptoms of miscarriage  \n What causes a miscarriage? \n There are probably many reasons why a miscarriage may happen, although the cause isn't usually identified. The majority aren't caused by anything the mother has done. \n It's thought most miscarriages are caused by abnormal chromosomes in the baby. Chromosomes are genetic \"building blocks\" that guide the development of a baby. If a baby has too many or not enough chromosomes, it won't develop properly. \n If a miscarriage happens during the second trimester of pregnancy (between weeks 14 and 26), it's sometimes the result of an underlying health condition in the mother. \n For most women, a miscarriage is a one-off event and they go on to have a successful pregnancy in the future. \n Read more about  what causes a miscarriage  \n Can miscarriages be prevented? \n The majority of miscarriages can't be prevented. If a woman has suffered from more than three miscarriages, some women can be helped to keep their pregnancy with medication under the care of a specialist. \n However, there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of a miscarriage. Avoid smoking, drinking alcohol and using drugs while pregnant. Being a healthy weight before getting pregnant, eating a healthy diet and reducing your risk of infection can also help. \n Read more about  preventing miscarriages  \n What happens if you think you're\u00a0having a miscarriage? \n If you have the symptoms of a miscarriage, you'll usually\u00a0be\u00a0referred to a hospital for tests. In most cases, an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  can determine whether the pregnancy is ongoing or you're having a miscarriage. \n When a miscarriage is confirmed, you'll need to talk to your doctor or nurse about the options for the management of the end of the pregnancy. \n In the majority of cases, the pregnancy tissue will pass out naturally in a week or two. Sometimes medication to assist the passage of the tissue may be recommended,\u00a0or you can choose to have minor surgery to remove it if you don't want to wait. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing a miscarriage  and\u00a0 what happens if you have a miscarriage  \n After a miscarriage \n A miscarriage can be an emotionally and physically draining experience. You may have feelings of guilt,\u00a0shock and anger. \n Advice and support is available at this time from hospital\u00a0counselling\u00a0services and charity groups. You may also find it beneficial to have\u00a0a memorial for\u00a0your lost\u00a0baby. \n You can try for another baby as soon as your symptoms have\u00a0settled and you've had one period,\u00a0although you should ensure you're emotionally and physically ready first. \n Having a\u00a0miscarriage doesn't necessarily mean you'll have another if you get pregnant again. Most\u00a0women are able to have a healthy pregnancy after a miscarriage, even in cases of recurrent miscarriages. \n Read more about  what happens after a miscarriage  \n How common are miscarriages? \n Miscarriages are much more common than most people realise. Among women who know they're pregnant, it's estimated\u00a0one in\u00a0six of these pregnancies will end in miscarriage. Many more miscarriages occur before a woman is even aware she has become pregnant. \n Losing three or more pregnancies in a row (recurrent miscarriages) is uncommon and only affects around 1 in 100 women.", "symptoms": "The most common sign of miscarriage is vaginal bleeding. \n This can vary from light spotting or brownish discharge to heavy bleeding and bright red blood. The bleeding may come and go over several days. \n However, light vaginal bleeding is relatively common during the first trimester of pregnancy (the first 12 weeks) and doesn't necessarily mean you're having a miscarriage. \n If you have vaginal bleeding, contact your GP, maternity team or early pregnancy unit at your local hospital as soon as possible. \n Other symptoms of a miscarriage include: \n \n cramping and pain in your lower abdomen \n a discharge of fluid from your vagina \n a discharge of tissue from your vagina \n no longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy, such as feeling sick and breast tenderness \n \n When to seek urgent medical help \n On rare occasions, miscarriages happen because the pregnancy develops outside the womb. This is known as an\u00a0 ectopic pregnancy . Ectopic pregnancies are potentially serious\u00a0as there's a risk you could experience internal bleeding. \n Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy may include: \n \n persistent and severe abdominal pain, usually on one side \n vaginal bleeding or spotting, commonly after the pain has started \n pain in your shoulder tip \n  diarrhoea  and vomiting \n feeling very faint and light-headed, and possibly fainting \n \n Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy usually appear between weeks\u00a05 and 14 of the pregnancy. \n If you experience any of the symptoms above, visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E)\u00a0department immediately. If you're unable to travel, call 999 and ask for an ambulance. \n Molar pregnancies \n In rare cases, vaginal bleeding can also be caused by a molar pregnancy. This is a pregnancy where the placenta (the part that feeds the baby) hasn't developed normally, resulting in a mass of abnormal cells within the womb instead of a baby. \n A molar pregnancy is usually identified during the first ultrasound scan, at 10 to 16 weeks of pregnancy.", "causes": "There are many reasons why a miscarriage may happen, although the cause is often not identified. \n If a miscarriage happens during the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months), it's usually caused by problems with the unborn baby (foetus). About\u00a0three in every\u00a0four miscarriages happen during this period. \n If a miscarriage happens during the second trimester of pregnancy (between weeks 14 and 26), it may be the result of an underlying health condition in the mother. \n These late miscarriages may be caused by an infection around the baby, which leads to the bag of waters breaking before any pain or bleeding. In rare cases, they can be caused by the neck of the womb opening too soon. \n First trimester miscarriages \n Most first trimester miscarriages are caused by problems with the chromosomes of the foetus. \n Chromosome problems \n Chromosomes are blocks of DNA. They contain a detailed set of instructions that control a wide range of factors, from how the cells of the body develop to what colour eyes a baby will have. \n Sometimes something can go wrong at the point of conception and the foetus receives too many or not enough chromosomes. The reasons for this are often unclear, but it means the foetus won't be able to develop normally, resulting in a miscarriage. \n It's estimated up to two-thirds of early miscarriages are associated with chromosome abnormalities. This is very unlikely to recur and doesn't mean there's any problem with the mother or father's chromosomes. \n Placental problems \n The placenta is the organ linking the mother's blood supply to her baby's. If there's\u00a0a problem with the development of the placenta, it can also lead to a miscarriage. \n Things that increase your risk \n An early miscarriage may happen by chance. But there are several things known to\u00a0increase\u00a0your risk\u00a0of problems happening. \n The\u00a0age of the mother has an influence: \n \n in women under 30, 1 in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage \n in women aged 35-39, up to 2 in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage \n in women over 45,\u00a0more than\u00a0half of all pregnancies will end in miscarriage \n \n Other risk factors include: \n \n  obesity  \n smoking during pregnancy \n drug misuse\u00a0during pregnancy \n drinking more than 200mg of\u00a0caffeine a day\u00a0\u2013 one mug of tea contains around 75mg of caffeine, and one mug of instant coffee contains around 100mg of caffeine; caffeine is also found in some fizzy drinks, energy drinks and chocolate bars \n drinking more than two units of\u00a0 alcohol  a week\u00a0\u2013\u00a0one unit is half a pint of bitter or ordinary strength lager, or a 25ml measure of spirits, and\u00a0a small 125ml glass of wine is 1.5 units \n \n Second trimester miscarriages \n Long-term health conditions \n Several\u00a0long-term (chronic) health conditions can increase your risk of having a miscarriage in the second trimester. These are: \n \n  diabetes \u00a0(if it's poorly controlled) \n severe  high blood pressure  \n  lupus \u00a0 \n  kidney disease \u00a0 \n an\u00a0 overactive thyroid gland  \n an\u00a0 underactive thyroid gland  \n \n Infections \n The following infections may also increase your risk: \n \n rubella (german measles) \n cytomegalovirus \n  bacterial vaginosis  \n  HIV  \n  chlamydia  \n  gonorrhoea \u00a0 \n  syphilis \u00a0 \n  malaria \u00a0 \n \n Food poisoning \n  Food poisoning , caused by eating contaminated food, can also increase the risk of miscarriage. For example: \n \n listeriosis\u00a0\u2013 most commonly found in unpasteurised dairy products, such as blue cheese \n toxoplasmosis \u2013 which can be caught\u00a0by eating raw or undercooked infected meat, particularly lamb, pork or venison \n salmonella \u2013 most often caused by eating raw or partly cooked eggs \n \n Read more about  foods to avoid in pregnancy  \n Medicines \n Medicines that increase your risk include: \n \n misoprostol\u00a0\u2013 used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis \n retinoids\u00a0\u2013 used for\u00a0eczema and acne \n methotrexate\u00a0\u2013 used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis \n non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\u00a0\u2013 such as ibuprofen; these are used for pain and inflammation \n \n To be sure a medicine is safe in pregnancy, always check with your doctor, midwife or pharmacist before taking it. \n Read more about  medicines during pregnancy  \n Womb structure \n Problems and abnormalities with your womb can also lead to second trimester miscarriages. Possible problems include: \n \n non-cancerous growths in the womb called  fibroids  \n an abnormally shaped womb \n \n Weakened cervix \n In some cases, the muscles of the cervix (neck of the womb) are weaker than usual. This is known as a weakened cervix or cervical incompetence. \n A weakened cervix may be caused by a previous injury to this area, usually after a surgical procedure. The muscle weakness can cause the cervix to open too early during pregnancy, leading to a miscarriage. \n Polycystic ovary syndrome \n Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition where the ovaries are larger than normal. It's caused by hormonal changes in the ovaries. \n PCOS is known to be a leading cause of  infertility \u00a0as it can lower the production of eggs. There's some evidence to suggest it may also be linked to an increased risk of miscarriages in fertile women. \n However, the exact role polycystic ovary syndrome plays in miscarriages is unclear. No treatment has been proven to make a difference and the majority of women with PCOS have successful pregnancies with no increased risk of miscarriage. \n Misconceptions about miscarriage \n An increased risk of miscarriage is not linked to: \n \n a mother's emotional state during pregnancy, such as being stressed or depressed \n having a shock or fright during pregnancy \n  exercise during pregnancy \u00a0\u2013 but discuss with your GP or midwife what type and amount of exercise is suitable for you during pregnancy \n lifting or straining during pregnancy \n working during pregnancy\u00a0\u2013 or work that involves sitting or standing for long periods \n having sex during pregnancy \n travelling by air \n eating spicy food \n \n Recurrent miscarriages \n Many women who have a miscarriage worry they'll have another if they get pregnant again. But most miscarriages are a one-off event. \n About 1 in 100 women experience recurrent miscarriages (three or more in a row) and\u00a0more than\u00a060%\u00a0of these women go on to have a successful pregnancy.", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you see your GP or midwife because of vaginal bleeding or other symptoms of miscarriage, you may be referred to an early pregnancy unit at a hospital for tests. \n If you're more than 18 weeks pregnant, you'll usually be referred to the maternity unit at the hospital. \n Tests \n The hospital can carry out tests to confirm whether you're having a miscarriage. The tests can also confirm whether there's still some pregnancy tissue left in your womb (an incomplete or delayed miscarriage) or if all the pregnancy tissue has been passed out of your womb (a complete miscarriage). \n The first test used is usually an\u00a0 ultrasound scan \u00a0to check\u00a0the development of your baby and look for a heartbeat. In most cases, this is usually carried out using a small probe inserted into the vagina (transvaginal ultrasound). This can feel a little uncomfortable but isn't painful. \n You may be\u00a0able to have an external scan through your tummy\u00a0if you prefer, although this method reduces the accuracy of the scan. Neither type of scan is dangerous to the baby and they don't increase your risk of miscarriage. \n You may also be offered\u00a0 blood tests  to measure hormones associated with pregnancy, such as beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone. These may be repeated after 48 hours if: \n \n the levels are borderline \n the scan isn't conclusive \n it's very early in your pregnancy \n \n Sometimes a miscarriage can't be confirmed immediately using ultrasound or blood testing. For example, a heartbeat may not be noticeable if your baby is at a very early stage of\u00a0development (less than\u00a0six weeks). If this is the case, you may be advised to have a further ultrasound or pregnancy test, or both,\u00a0again in a week or two. \n Recurrent miscarriages \n If you've had three or more miscarriages in a row (recurrent miscarriages), further tests\u00a0are often used to\u00a0check\u00a0for any underlying cause. However, no cause is found in about half of cases. These further tests are outlined below. \n If you become pregnant, most units offer an early ultrasound scan and follow-up in the early stages to reassure and support parents. \n Karyotyping \n If you've had recurrent miscarriages, you and your partner can be tested for abnormalities in your chromosomes (blocks of DNA) that could be causing the problem, which is the rarest of known causes. This type of testing is known as karyotyping. \n If karyotyping detects problems with your or your partner's chromosomes, you can be referred to a clinical geneticist (gene expert). \n They'll be able to explain your chances of\u00a0a successful pregnancy in the future and whether there are any fertility treatments, such as\u00a0 in vitro fertilisation (IVF) , that you could try. This type of advice is known as genetic counselling. \n Read more about  genetic testing  \n Ultrasound scans \n A\u00a0transvaginal ultrasound\u00a0can be used to check the structure of your womb for any abnormalities.\u00a0A second procedure may be used with a 3D ultrasound scanner to study your lower abdomen and pelvis to provide a more accurate diagnosis. \n The\u00a0scan\u00a0can also check if you have a weakened cervix. This test can usually only be carried out when you become pregnant again, in which case you'll usually be asked to come for a scan when you are between 10 and 12 weeks pregnant. \n Blood testing \n Your blood can be checked for high levels of the antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody and lupus anticoagulant. This test should be done twice, six weeks apart, when you're not pregnant. \n Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies are known to increase the chance of blood clots and alter the way the placenta attaches. These blood clots and changes can\u00a0reduce the blood supply to the foetus, which can cause a miscarriage. \n Missed or delayed miscarriage \n Sometimes a miscarriage is diagnosed during a routine scan carried out as part of your  antenatal care . A scan may reveal your baby has no heartbeat, or that your baby is too small for the date of your pregnancy. This is called a missed or delayed miscarriage."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Mesothelioma", "introduction": "Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body's organs. It's usually linked to asbestos exposure. \n Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lungs (pleural mesothelioma), although it can also affect the lining of the tummy (peritoneal mesothelioma), heart or testicles. \n More than 2,600 people are diagnosed with the condition each year in the UK. Most cases are diagnosed in people aged 60-80 and men are affected more commonly than women. \n Unfortunately it's rarely possible to cure mesothelioma, although treatment can help control the symptoms. \n Symptoms of mesothelioma \n The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don't appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos. \n Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs\u00a0include: \n \n  chest pain  \n  shortness of breath  \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n a high temperature (fever) and sweating, particularly at night \n a persistent\u00a0 cough  \n loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss \n clubbed (swollen) fingertips \n \n Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy\u00a0include: \n \n  tummy pain \u00a0or swelling \n feeling or being sick \n loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss \n  diarrhoea \u00a0or  constipation  \n \n See your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past. \n What causes mesothelioma? \n Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a\u00a0group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that\u00a0used to be widely used in construction. \n These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the\u00a0lungs\u00a0over time.\u00a0It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma\u00a0typically developing more than\u00a020 years\u00a0after exposure to asbestos. \n The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However,\u00a0materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. \n Read more about  asbestos and people at risk of exposure \u00a0and  avoiding exposure to asbestos . \n How mesothelioma is diagnosed \n If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests. \n A\u00a0number of different tests may need to be carried out, including: \n \n an  X-ray \u00a0of your chest or tummy \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan \u00a0\u2013 a number of X-ray images are taken to\u00a0create a detailed image of the inside of the body \n fluid drainage \u2013 if there's a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed \n a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy \u2013 the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that's inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or  anaesthetic ; a sample of tissue ( biopsy ) may be removed so it can be analysed \n \n These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread. \n Treatments for mesothelioma \n The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health. \n As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible.\u00a0This is known as\u00a0 palliative or supportive care . \n Possible treatments include: \n \n  chemotherapy \u00a0\u2013 this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer \n  radiotherapy \u00a0\u2013 this involves using\u00a0high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control \n surgery \u2013\u00a0an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it's not clear whether surgery is helpful \n \n You'll also\u00a0probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help\u00a0relieve\u00a0your pain. \n Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you. \n Outlook for mesothelioma \n Unfortunately the outlook for mesothelioma tends to be poor. This is because it doesn't usually cause any obvious symptoms until late on and it can progress quite quickly once it reaches this stage. \n Overall: \n \n around half (50%) of people with mesothelioma will live at least a year after diagnosis \n around one in every 10 people (10%)\u00a0with mesothelioma will live at least\u00a0five years after diagnosis \n \n There are\u00a0currently around 2,500 deaths from mesothelioma each year in the UK.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Middle ear infection (otitis media)", "introduction": "Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum. \n Anyone can develop a middle ear infection but infants between\u00a0six and 15 months old are most commonly affected. \n It's estimated that around one\u00a0in every four children experience at least one middle ear infection by the time they're 10 years old. \n Symptoms of\u00a0a middle ear infection \n In most cases, the symptoms of a middle\u00a0ear infection (otitis media) develop\u00a0quickly and resolve in a few days. This is known as\u00a0acute otitis media. The main symptoms include: \n \n  earache  \n a high temperature (fever) \n being sick \n a lack of energy \n slight  hearing loss \u00a0\u2013 if the middle ear becomes filled with fluid, hearing loss may be a sign of\u00a0 glue ear , also known as otitis media with effusion \n \n In some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear.\u00a0The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves. \n Signs in young children \n As babies are unable to communicate the source of their discomfort, it can be difficult to tell what's wrong with them. Signs that\u00a0a young\u00a0child might have an ear infection include: \n \n pulling, tugging or rubbing their ear \n irritability, poor feeding\u00a0or restlessness at night \n  coughing \u00a0or a runny nose \n  diarrhoea  \n unresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of difficulty hearing, such as inattentiveness \n loss of balance \n \n When to seek medical advice \n Most cases of otitis media pass within a few days, so there's usually no need to see your GP. \n However, see\u00a0your GP if you or your child have: \n \n symptoms showing no sign of improvement after two or three days \n a lot of pain \n a discharge of pus or fluid from the ear \u2013 some people develop a persistent and painless ear discharge that lasts\u00a0for many months, known as chronic suppurative otitis media \n an underlying health condition, such as  cystic fibrosis  or  congenital heart disease , which could make complications more likely \n \n Read more about  diagnosing middle ear infections  \n How middle ear infections are treated \n Most ear infections clear up within three to five days and don't need any specific treatment. If necessary,  paracetamol  or\u00a0 ibuprofen  should be used to relieve pain and a high temperature. \n Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age. Read more about giving your child painkillers. \n  Antibiotics  aren't routinely used to treat middle ear infections, although they may occasionally be prescribed if symptoms persist or are particularly severe. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating middle ear infections  \n What causes middle ear infections? \n Most middle ear infections occur when an infection\u00a0such as a  cold , leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear and causes the Eustachian tube\u00a0(a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or\u00a0blocked. \n This mean\u00a0mucus can't drain away properly, making it easier for an infection\u00a0to spread into the middle ear. \n An enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it causes persistent or frequent ear infections. Read more about\u00a0removing adenoids. \n Younger children are particularly vulnerable to middle ear infections as: \n \n the Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults \n a child's adenoids are relatively\u00a0much larger than an adults \n \n Certain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including: \n \n having a cleft palate\u00a0\u2013 a type of birth defect where a child has a split in the roof of their mouth \n having  Down's syndrome \u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features \n \n Can middle ear infections be prevented? \n It's not possible to prevent middle ear infections, but there are some things you can do that may reduce your child's risk of developing the condition. These include: \n \n make sure your child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations\u00a0\u2013 particularly the pneumococcal vaccine\u00a0and the DTaP/IPV/Hib (5-in-1)\u00a0vaccine \n avoid exposing your child to smoky environments (passive smoking) \n don't give your child a dummy once they're\u00a0older than\u00a0six to 12 months old \n don't feed your child while they're lying flat on their back \n if possible, feed your baby with breast milk rather than formula milk \n \n Avoiding contact with other children who are unwell may also help reduce your child's chances of catching an infection that could lead to a middle ear infection. \n Further problems \n Complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious if they do occur. \n Most complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head, including: \n \n the bones behind the ear (mastoiditis) \n the inner ear ( labyrinthitis ) \n the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord\u00a0( meningitis ) \n \n If complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital. \n Read more about the  complications of middle ear infections", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Most middle ear infections (otitis media) clear up within three to five days and don't need any specific treatment. \n You can relieve any pain and a high temperature using over the counter painkillers such as  paracetamol \u00a0and  ibuprofen . \n Make sure any painkillers you give to your child are appropriate for their age. \n Placing a warm flannel or washcloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain until the condition passes. \n Antibiotics \n  Antibiotics  aren't routinely used to treat middle ear infections as there's no evidence that they speed up the healing process. Many cases are\u00a0caused by viruses, which antibiotics aren't effective against. \n Using antibiotics to treat minor bacterial infections also increases the likelihood of bacteria\u00a0becoming\u00a0resistant to them over time. This\u00a0means more serious infections could become untreatable in the future. Read about antibiotic resistance\u00a0for more information. \n If antibiotics are needed,\u00a0a five-day course of an antibiotic called amoxicillin is\u00a0usually prescribed. This is often given as a liquid. Common side effects of amoxicillin include:\u00a0 \n \n a rash \n feeling sick \n  diarrhoea  \n \n An alternative antibiotic such as erythromycin\u00a0or clarithromycin may be used for people allergic to amoxicillin. \n In some cases, your GP\u00a0may give you\u00a0a prescription that you can choose to pick up a few days later if the condition hasn't improved by then. \n Adults and children who develop a long-term middle ear infection (chronic suppurative otitis media) may benefit from short courses of antibiotic ear drops. \n Children \n Antibiotics\u00a0are usually only considered\u00a0if your child: \n \n has a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to\u00a0complications, such as\u00a0 cystic fibrosis  or  congenital heart disease  \n is less than three months old \n is less than\u00a0two years old with an infection in both ears \n has\u00a0discharge coming from their ear \n \n Adults\u00a0 \n Adults may be prescribed antibiotics if: \n \n they have\u00a0a serious health condition that makes them more vulnerable to\u00a0complications, such as\u00a0cystic fibrosis or  congenital heart disease  \n symptoms are showing no signs of improvement after four days \n \n Grommets \n For children with recurrent severe middle ear infections, tiny tubes may be inserted\u00a0into the eardrum to help drain fluid. These tubes are called grommets. \n Grommets are inserted under\u00a0 general anaesthetic , which means your child\u00a0will be\u00a0asleep and won't feel any pain. The procedure\u00a0usually only takes about 15 minutes and your child should be able to go home the same day. \n A grommet helps keep the eardrum open for several months. As the eardrum starts to heal, the grommet will slowly be pushed out of the eardrum and eventually falls out. This process happens naturally and shouldn't be painful. Most grommets fall out within\u00a0six to 12 months of being inserted. \n Some children need another procedure to replace the grommets if they're still experiencing problems. \n Treatment with grommets isn't routinely funded in all areas or for adults with recurrent otitis media.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "A middle ear infection (otitis media) can usually be diagnosed using an instrument called an otoscope. \n An otoscope is a small handheld device with a magnifying glass and a light source at the end. Using an otoscope, a\u00a0doctor\u00a0can\u00a0examine the ear to look for signs of fluid in the middle ear, which may indicate an infection. \n Signs of fluid in the middle ear can include the ear drum: \n \n bulging \n being an unusual colour (usually red or yellow) \n having a cloudy appearance \n \n In some cases, a hole may have developed in the eardrum (perforated ear drum) and there may be fluid in the ear canal (the tube between the outer ear and eardrum). \n Some otoscopes can also be used to blow a small puff of air into the ear to check for any blockages in the middle ear, which\u00a0could be a sign of an infection.\u00a0If the Eustachian tube (the tube that connects\u00a0the throat and middle ear) is clear, the eardrum will move slightly.\u00a0If it's blocked, the eardrum will remain still. \n Further\u00a0tests \n Further tests are normally only required if treatment\u00a0isn't working or complications develop.\u00a0These tests will usually be carried out at your local ear, nose and throat (ENT) department. \n Some of the\u00a0tests that may be carried out are described below. \n Tympanometry \n Tympanometry is a test that measures how the ear drum reacts to changes in air pressure. \n During a tympanometry test, a probe is placed into your child's ear. The probe changes the air pressure at regular intervals while transmitting a sound into the ear. A measuring device is attached to the probe to record how the drum moves and how changes in air pressure affect this movement. \n A healthy ear drum should move easily if there's a change in air pressure. If your child's ear drum moves slowly or not at all, it usually suggests there's fluid behind it. \n Audiometry \n Audiometry is a hearing test that uses a machine called an audiometer to produce sounds of different volume and frequency. This can help determine if your child has any hearing loss as a result of their condition. \n During the test, your child listens through headphones and is asked if\u00a0they can hear\u00a0the sounds. \n Scans \n On the very rare occasions where there's a possibility the infection has spread out of the middle ear and into the surrounding area, a scan of the ear may be carried out. This may be\u00a0either a: \n \n  computerised\u00a0tomography (CT) scan  \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \n \n A CT scan takes a series of\u00a0 X-rays  and uses a computer to assemble the scans into a more detailed image, whereas an MRI scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images of the inside of the body."},

However, most women experience them at other times too and this is called menstrual related migraine. \n Many women find their migraines improve after the  menopause , although the menopause can trigger migraines or make them worse in some women. \n Emotional triggers: \n \n stress \n anxiety \n tension \n shock \n  depression  \n excitement \n \n Physical triggers: \n \n tiredness \n poor quality sleep \n shift work \n poor posture \n neck or shoulder tension \n jet lag \n low blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) \n strenuous exercise, if you're not used to it \n \n Dietary triggers: \n \n missed, delayed or irregular meals \n  dehydration  \n alcohol \n the food additive tyramine \n caffeine products, such as tea and coffee \n specific foods such as chocolate, citrus fruit and cheese \n \n Environmental triggers: \n \n bright lights \n flickering screens, such as a television or computer screen \n smoking (or smoky rooms) \n loud noises \n changes in climate, such as changes in humidity or very cold temperatures \n strong smells \n a stuffy atmosphere \n \n Medication: \n \n some types of sleeping tablets \n the\u00a0 combined contraceptive pill  \n  hormone replacement therapy (HRT) , which is sometimes used to relieve symptoms associated with the menopause", "treatment": "There's currently no cure for migraines, although a number of treatments are available to help ease the symptoms. \n It may take time to work out the best treatment for you. You may need to try different types or combinations of medicines before you find the most effective ones. \n If you find you can't manage your migraines using over-the-counter medicines, your GP may prescribe something stronger. \n During an attack \n Most people find that sleeping or lying in a darkened room is the best thing to do when having a migraine attack. \n Others find that eating something helps, or they start to feel better once they've been sick. \n Painkillers \n Many people who have migraines find that over-the-counter painkillers, such as\u00a0 paracetamol , aspirin and\u00a0 ibuprofen , can help to reduce\u00a0their symptoms. \n They tend to be most effective if taken at the first signs of a migraine attack, as this gives them time to absorb into your bloodstream and ease your symptoms. \n It's not advisable to wait until the headache worsens before taking painkillers as it's often too late for the medication to work. Soluble painkillers (tablets\u00a0you dissolve in a glass of water) are a good alternative because they're absorbed quickly by your body. \n If you can't swallow painkillers because of nausea or vomiting, suppositories may be a better option. These are capsules that are inserted into the anus (back passage). \n Cautions \n When taking over-the-counter painkillers, always make sure you read the instructions on the packaging and follow the dosage recommendations. \n Children under 16 shouldn't take aspirin unless it's under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Aspirin and ibuprofen are also not recommended for adults who have a history of stomach problems, such as  stomach ulcers , liver problems or kidney problems. \n Taking any form of painkiller frequently can make migraines worse. This is sometimes called \"medication overuse headache\" or \"painkiller headache\". \n Speak to your GP if you find yourself needing to use painkillers repeatedly or if over-the-counter painkillers aren't effective. Your GP may prescribe stronger painkillers or recommend using\u00a0painkillers along with triptans (see below). If they\u00a0suspect the frequent use of painkillers may be contributing your headaches, they may recommended that you stop using them. \n Triptans \n If ordinary painkillers aren't helping to relieve your migraine symptoms, you should make an appointment to see your GP. They may recommend taking painkillers in addition to a type of medication called a triptan and possibly anti-sickness medication (see below). \n Triptan medicines are a specific painkiller for migraine headaches. They're thought to work by reversing the changes in the brain that may cause migraine headaches. \n They cause the blood vessels around the brain to contract (narrow). This reverses the dilating (widening) of blood vessels that's believed to be part of the migraine process. \n Triptans are available as tablets, injections and nasal sprays. \n Common side effects of triptans include: \n \n warm-sensations \n tightness \n tingling \n flushing \n feelings of heaviness in the face, limbs or chest \n \n Some people also experience nausea, dry mouth and drowsiness.\u00a0These side effects are usually mild and improve on their own. \n As with other painkillers, taking too many triptans can lead to medication overuse headache. \n Your GP will usually recommend having a follow-up appointment\u00a0once you've finished your first course of treatment with triptans. This is so you can discuss their effectiveness and whether you had any side effects. \n If the medication was helpful, treatment will usually be continued. If they weren't effective or caused unpleasant side effects, your GP may try prescribing a different type of triptan since responses can be highly variable. \n Anti-sickness medicines \n Anti-sickness medicines,\u00a0known as anti-emetics, can successfully treat migraine in some people even if you don't experience nausea or vomiting. These are prescribed by your GP and can be taken alongside painkillers and triptans. \n As with painkillers, anti-sickness medicines work better if taken as soon as your migraine symptoms begin. They usually come in the form of a tablet, but are also available as a suppository. \n Side effects of anti-emetics include drowsiness and  diarrhoea . \n Combination medicines \n You can buy a number of combination medicines for migraine\u00a0without a prescription at your local pharmacy. These medicines contain both painkillers and anti-sickness medicines. If you're not sure which one is best for you, ask your pharmacist. \n It can also be very effective to combine a triptan with another painkiller, such as ibuprofen. \n Many people find combination medicines convenient. However, the dose of painkillers or anti-sickness medicine may not be high enough to relieve your symptoms. If this is the case, it may be better to take painkillers and anti-sickness medicines separately. This allows you to easily control the doses of each. \n Seeing a specialist \n If the treatments above\u00a0aren't effectively controlling your migraines, your GP may refer you to a specialist migraine clinic for further investigation and treatment. \n In addition to the\u00a0medications mentioned above, a specialist may recommend other treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. \n Transcranial magnetic stimulation \n In January 2014, the\u00a0 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  approved the use of a treatment called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for the treatment and prevention of migraines. \n TMS involves holding a small electrical device to your head that delivers magnetic pulses through your skin. It's not clear exactly how TMS works in treating migraines, but studies have shown that using it at the start of a migraine can reduce its severity. It can also be used in combination with the medications mentioned above without interfering with them. \n However, TMS isn't a cure for migraines and it doesn\u2019t work for everyone. The evidence for its effectiveness isn't strong and is limited to people who have migraine with aura. \n There's also little evidence about the potential long-term effects of the treatment, although studies into the treatment have so far only reported minor and temporary side effects, including: \n \n slight dizziness \n drowsiness and tiredness \n a\u00a0muscle tremor that can make it difficult to stand \n irritability \n \n NICE recommends that TMS should only be provided by headache specialists in specialist centres, because of the uncertainty about the potential long-term side effects. The specialist will keep a record of your experiences using the treatment. \n Treatment for pregnant and breastfeeding women \n In general, migraine treatment with medicines should be limited as much as possible when you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Instead, trying to identify and avoid potential  migraine triggers  is often recommended. \n If medication is essential, then your GP may prescribe you a low-dose painkiller, such as paracetamol. In some cases, anti-inflammatory drugs or triptans may be prescribed. Speak to your GP or midwife before taking medication when you are pregnant or breastfeeding.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "There's no specific test to diagnose migraines. For an accurate diagnosis to be made, your GP must identify a pattern of recurring headaches along with the associated symptoms. \n Migraines can be unpredictable, sometimes occurring without the other symptoms. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take time. \n Seeing your GP \n On your first visit, your GP may carry out a physical examination and check your vision, co-ordination, reflexes and sensations. These\u00a0will help rule out some other possible underlying causes of your symptoms. \n Your GP may ask if your headaches are: \n \n on one side of the head \n a pulsating pain \n severe enough to prevent you carrying out daily activities \n made worse by physical activity or moving about \n accompanied by nausea and vomiting \n accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise \n \n Migraine diary \n To help with the diagnosis, it can be useful to keep a diary of your migraine attacks for a few weeks. Note down details including: \n \n the date \n time \n what you were doing when the migraine began \n how long the attack lasted \n what symptoms you experienced \n what medication you took (if any) \n \n Taking too many painkillers is an important reason why migraines can become difficult to treat. This is called analgesic overuse headache. \n It will be very helpful to keep a record of what painkillers you take and how often you take them. You shouldn't take painkillers on more than 10 days every month in the long-term. \n It\u00a0may also be helpful for women to make a note when they start their period,\u00a0as this can help your GP identify potential triggers. \n Read more about\u00a0 keeping a migraine diary  on The Migraine Trust website \n Referral to a specialist \n Your GP may decide to refer you to a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system) for further assessment and treatment if:\u00a0 \n \n a diagnosis is unclear \n you experience migraines on\u00a015 days or more per month (chronic migraine) \n treatment isn't helping to control your symptoms"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Menopause", "introduction": "The menopause is when a woman stops having periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally. \n Periods usually start to become less frequent over a few months or years before they stop altogether. Sometimes they can stop suddenly. \n The menopause\u00a0is a natural part of ageing that usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age, as a woman's oestrogen levels decline.\u00a0In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51. \n However, around 1 in 100 women experience the menopause before 40 years of age. This is known as\u00a0premature menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency. \n Symptoms of the menopause \n Most women will experience menopausal symptoms. Some of these can be quite severe and have a significant impact on your everyday activities. \n Common symptoms include: \n \n hot flushes \n night sweats \n vaginal dryness\u00a0and discomfort during sex \n  difficulty sleeping  \n  low mood \u00a0or anxiety \n  reduced sex drive (libido)  \n problems with memory and concentration \n \n Menopausal\u00a0symptoms can begin months or even years before your periods stop and last around four years\u00a0after your last period,\u00a0although some women experience them for much longer. \n Read more about the  symptoms of the menopause  \n When to see your GP \n It's worth talking to your GP if you have menopausal symptoms that are troubling you or if you're experiencing symptoms of the menopause before 45 years of age. \n Your GP can usually confirm whether you are menopausal based on your symptoms, but a\u00a0 blood test \u00a0to measure your hormone levels may be carried out if you're aged 40 to 45. \n Blood tests may also be carried out to help diagnose suspected premature menopause if you\u2019re under 40 and have menopausal symptoms. \n Treatments for menopausal symptoms \n Your GP can\u00a0offer treatments and suggest lifestyle changes if you have severe menopausal symptoms that interfere with your day-to-day\u00a0life, including: \n \n  hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \u00a0\u2013\u00a0tablets,\u00a0skin patches, gels\u00a0and implants that relieve menopausal symptoms by replacing oestrogen \n vaginal oestrogen creams,\u00a0lubricants or moisturisers for vaginal dryness \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013 a type of talking therapy that can help with low mood and anxiety \n eating a\u00a0 healthy, balanced diet \u00a0and  exercising regularly \u00a0\u2013 maintaining a healthy weight and staying fit and strong can improve some menopausal symptoms \n \n Your GP can refer you to a menopause specialist if your symptoms don't improve after trying treatment or if you're unable to take HRT. \n Read more about  treating the menopause  \n What causes the menopause? \n The menopause\u00a0is caused by a change in the balance of the body's sex hormones, which occurs as you get older. \n It happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone oestrogen and no longer release an egg each month. \n Premature\u00a0or early menopause\u00a0can occur at any age, and in many cases, there's no clear cause. \n Sometimes it's caused by a treatment such as surgery to remove the ovaries (oophorectomy), some\u00a0 breast cancer  treatments,  chemotherapy \u00a0or  radiotherapy , or it can be brought on by an underlying medical condition, such as  Down's syndrome \u00a0or\u00a0 Addison's disease .", "symptoms": "Most women will experience some symptoms around the menopause.

However, around\u00a01 in every\u00a010 women experience them for up to 12 years. \n If you experience the menopause suddenly rather than gradually\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, as a result of cancer treatment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0your symptoms may be worse. \n Changes\u00a0to your periods \n The first sign of the menopause\u00a0is usually a change in the normal pattern of your periods. \n You may start having either unusually light or  heavy periods . \n The frequency of your periods may also be affected. You may have one every two or three weeks, or you may not have one for months at a time. \n Eventually, you'll stop having periods altogether. \n Common menopausal symptoms \n About 8 in every 10 women will have\u00a0additional symptoms for some time before and after their periods stop. \n These\u00a0can have a significant impact on daily life for some women. \n Common symptoms\u00a0include: \n \n hot flushes\u00a0\u2013 short, sudden feelings of heat, usually in the face, neck and chest,\u00a0which\u00a0can\u00a0make your skin red and sweaty \n night sweats\u00a0\u2013 hot flushes that occur at night \n  difficulty sleeping \u00a0\u2013 this may make you feel tired and irritable during the day \n a  reduced sex drive (libido)  \n problems with memory and concentration \n vaginal dryness and\u00a0pain, itching or discomfort during sex \n  headaches  \n mood changes, such as\u00a0 low mood  or anxiety \n  palpitations \u00a0\u2013 heartbeats that suddenly become more noticeable \n joint stiffness, aches and pains \n reduced muscle mass \n recurrent  urinary tract infections (UTIs) ,\u00a0such as  cystitis  \n \n The menopause can also increase your risk of developing certain other problems, such as  weak bones (osteoporosis) . \n See your GP if you're finding your symptoms particularly troublesome, as treatments are available. \n Read about  how to manage symptoms of the menopause", "causes": "", "treatment": "Not all women want treatment to relieve  symptoms of the menopause , but treatments are available if you find the symptoms particularly troublesome. \n The main treatment for menopausal symptoms is\u00a0 hormone replacement therapy (HRT) , although\u00a0other treatments are also available for some of the symptoms. \n Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \n HRT involves taking oestrogen to replace the decline in your body's own levels around the time of the menopause. This can relieve many of the associated symptoms. \n HRT has been out of favour since the early 2000s because of a link with breast cancer, but\u00a0 new guidelines  from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say that HRT is effective and should be offered to women with menopausal symptoms, after discussing the risks and benefits. \n There are two main types of HRT: \n \n combined HRT (oestrogen and\u00a0progestogen) \u2013 for women with menopausal symptoms who still have their womb (oestrogen taken on its own can otherwise increase your risk of\u00a0 womb\u00a0cancer ) \n oestrogen-only HRT \u2013 for women who have had their womb removed in a\u00a0 hysterectomy  \n \n HRT is available as tablets, skin patches, a gel to rub into the skin\u00a0or implants. \n HRT is extremely effective at relieving menopausal symptoms, especially hot flushes and night sweats, but there are a\u00a0number of side effects, including breast tenderness,\u00a0 headaches  and vaginal bleeding. It's\u00a0also associated with an increased risk of\u00a0 blood clots  and  breast cancer \u00a0in some women. \n HRT is not advisable for some women, such as those who have had certain types of breast cancer or are at high risk of getting breast cancer. \n Your GP can give you more information about the risks and benefits of HRT to help you decide whether or not you want to take it. \n Read more about\u00a0 HRT  \n Hot flushes and night sweats \n If\u00a0you experience\u00a0hot flushes\u00a0and\u00a0night sweats as a result of the menopause, simple measures may sometimes help, such as: \n \n wearing light clothing \n keeping your bedroom cool at night \n taking a cool shower, using a fan or having a cold drink \n trying to\u00a0 reduce your stress levels  \n avoiding potential triggers, such as spicy food, caffeine,\u00a0smoking and alcohol \n taking regular\u00a0 exercise  and\u00a0 losing weight  if you're overweight \n \n If the flushes and sweats are frequent or severe, your GP may suggest taking HRT. \n If HRT isn't suitable for you, or you would prefer not to have it, your GP may recommend other medications that can help, such as clonidine (a  high blood pressure \u00a0medicine)\u00a0or certain  antidepressants . \n These medications can\u00a0cause unpleasant side effects, so it's important to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before starting treatment. \n Mood changes \n Some women experience mood swings, low mood and anxiety around the time of the menopause. \n Self-help measures such as getting plenty of rest, taking regular exercise and doing relaxing activities such as  yoga\u00a0and tai chi \u00a0may help. Medication and other treatments are also available, including HRT and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \n CBT is\u00a0a type of talking therapy that can improve low mood and feelings of anxiety. Your GP may be able to refer you for CBT on the NHS, or recommend self-help options such as online CBT courses.\u00a0 \n Antidepressants may\u00a0help if you've been diagnosed with  depression . \n Reduced sexual desire \n It's common for women to lose interest in sex around the time of the menopause, but HRT can often help with this. If HRT isn't effective, you might be offered a testosterone supplement. \n Testosterone is the male sex hormone, but it can help to restore sex drive in menopausal women. It\u2019s not currently licensed for use in women, although it can be prescribed by a doctor if they think it might help. \n Possible side effects of testosterone supplements include\u00a0 acne  and unwanted hair growth. \n Read more about\u00a0 loss of libido  and  female sexual problems  \n Vaginal dryness and discomfort \n If\u00a0your vagina becomes dry, painful or itchy as a result of the menopause, your GP can prescribe oestrogen treatment that's\u00a0put directly into your vagina as a pessary, cream or vaginal ring. \n This can safely be used alongside HRT. \n You'll usually need to use vaginal oestrogen indefinitely, as your symptoms are likely to return when treatment stops.

See  obesity  for more information about the main problems associated with overnutrition. \n Who's affected by malnutrition? \n Malnutrition is a common health problem. There are an estimated 3 million malnourished people in the UK at any time, with many more at risk of becoming malnourished. \n Around one in three people admitted to hospital or care homes in the UK are found to be malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. \n Malnutrition is caused by having an inadequate diet or a problem absorbing nutrients from food. There are many reasons why these might happen, including having reduced mobility, a long-term health condition, or a low income. \n Read more about the  causes of malnutrition  \n Signs of malnutrition \n The most common symptom of undernutrition is unintentional weight loss (losing 5-10% or more of your body weight over three to six months). \n Other signs can\u00a0include: \n \n weak muscles \n feeling tired all the time \n low mood \n an increase in\u00a0illnesses or infections\u00a0 \n \n The main sign of overnutrition is being overweight or obese. However, people with undernutrition can also be overweight if they eat a diet high in energy (calories), but low in other nutrients. \n Signs of malnutrition in children can include failure to grow at the expected rate and changes in behaviour, such as appearing unusually irritable, sluggish or anxious. \n Your child\u2019s weight and physical development should be regularly assessed by your GP when your child is young.

You can use the  BMI healthy weight chart \u00a0to work out your BMI. \n You should visit your GP if you believe you or someone you care for is at risk of malnutrition. They can check for signs of malnourishment and any conditions that may cause malnutrition. \n Read more about  diagnosing malnutrition  \n Treating malnutrition \n Depending on what's caused a person to become malnourished and how severe it is, treatment may be carried out at home or in hospital. \n Dietary changes are the main treatment for malnutrition. If you're undernourished, you may need to increase the nutritional content of your food, with or without taking nutritional supplements. \n If you're unable to eat enough to meet your nutritional needs you may need: \n \n a feeding tube to provide nutrients directly into your digestive system \n a drip to provide nutrients and fluids directly into a vein \n \n Read more about  treating malnutrition  \n Preventing malnutrition \n The best way to prevent malnutrition is to eat a healthy, balanced diet. \n A healthy, balanced diet is vital for maintaining health and fitness. To stay healthy, you need to eat a variety of foods from the four main food groups including: \n \n plenty of\u00a0fruit and vegetables \n plenty of bread, rice, potatoes, pasta and other\u00a0starchy foods \n some milk and dairy foods \n some meat, fish, eggs, beans\u00a0and other non dairy sources of protein \n \n The  eatwell guide \u00a0shows the different types of food you need to eat (and in what proportions) to maintain a well-balanced and healthy diet. \n Read more about  preventing malnutrition", "symptoms": "The most common symptom of malnutrition is unplanned and unexplained weight loss. \n Adults \n If you lose 5-10% or more of your body weight within three to six months and you're not trying to lose weight, it could be a sign that you're at risk of malnourishment. \n Sometimes, weight loss isn't obvious because\u00a0it occurs slowly, over time. You may notice that your\u00a0clothes, belts and jewellery gradually feel looser. \n Other signs of malnutrition may include: \n \n feeling tired all the time and lacking energy \n frequently getting infections\u00a0 \n taking a long time to recover from infections \n delayed wound healing\u00a0 \n poor concentration \n difficulty keeping warm \n  depression  \n \n A good way of assessing whether you're malnourished is to work out your\u00a0body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measurement that shows whether you're a healthy weight for your height. \n For most adults a healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.\u00a0Having a\u00a0BMI under 18.5 could suggest you're at a high risk of being malnourished, although you may also\u00a0be considered at risk if you have a BMI between 18.5 and 20. \n It's important to note that BMI and weight loss aren't the only indicators of malnutrition. A person can be overweight or obese and still be malnourished. This can be due to having a diet consisting of food and drink that's\u00a0high in fat and sugar but low in essential  vitamins and minerals . \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if your BMI is lower than 18.5, you've lost more than 5-10% of your body weight over the last three to six months, or you experience the symptoms listed above. \n Children \n Symptoms of malnutrition in children can include: \n \n failure to grow at the expected rate, both in terms of weight and height (known as \"failure to thrive\") \n changes in behaviour, such as being unusually irritable, sluggish or anxious \n changes in hair and skin colour \n \n When to see your GP \n Your child\u2019s weight and physical development should be regularly assessed by your GP or a health visitor during your child's first few years of life. \n Contact your GP if you have any concerns about your child\u2019s health or development.", "causes": "Malnutrition is caused by a lack of nutrients in your diet. \n This is either due to an inadequate diet or problems absorbing nutrients from food. \n Medical conditions \n Medical conditions that can lead to malnutrition include: \n \n a condition that causes a lack of appetite, such as  cancer ,  liver disease , persistent pain or nausea \n a mental health condition, such as  depression  or  schizophrenia , which may affect your ability to look after yourself \n a health condition that requires frequent hospital admissions \n a health condition that disrupts your body\u2019s ability to digest food or absorb nutrients, such as\u00a0 Crohn's disease  or  ulcerative colitis  \n  dementia  \u2013 people with dementia may be unable to communicate their needs when it comes to eating \n  dysphagia  \u2013 a condition that makes swallowing difficult or painful\u00a0 \n persistent vomiting or  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n an eating disorder, such as  anorexia nervosa  \n \n Some types of medication may increase your risk of developing malnutrition. More than 250 types of medicine are known to disrupt the body\u2019s ability to absorb and then break down nutrients. \n You may also be at risk of becoming malnourished if your body has an increased demand for energy \u2013 for example, if it's trying to heal itself after major surgery, or a serious injury such as a  burn , or if you experience involuntary movements, such as a tremor. \n Physical factors \n Physical factors can also contribute to malnutrition. For example: \n \n if\u00a0your teeth are in a poor condition, or if dentures don't fit properly, eating can be difficult or painful\u00a0 \n you may lose your appetite as a result of losing your sense of smell and taste \n you may have a physical disability or other impairment that makes it difficult for you to cook or shop for food yourself\u00a0 \n \n Social factors \n Social\u00a0situations that can contribute to malnutrition include: \n \n living alone and being socially isolated \n having limited knowledge about nutrition or cooking \n reduced mobility \n alcohol or drug dependency \n low income or poverty \n \n Children \n In the UK, the most common causes of malnutrition in children are long-term health conditions that: \n \n cause lack of appetite \n disrupt the normal process of digestion \n cause the body to have an increased demand for energy \n \n Examples of these types of conditions include childhood cancers,  congenital heart disease ,  cystic fibrosis  and cerebral palsy. \n In the UK, malnutrition as a result of inadequate food intake is rare, although it may occur if a child is neglected, living in poverty or being abused. If you're concerned that a child may be at risk of neglect or abuse, call the  NSPCC  child protection helpline on  0808 800 5000 . \n Sometimes, children become malnourished\u00a0because they avoid eating due to issues with their body image.", "treatment": "Treatment for malnutrition depends on the underlying cause and how malnourished a person is. \n You\u00a0may be given advice to use at home, or you may be treated at home under the supervision of a dietitian or other qualified healthcare professional. In some cases, hospital admission will be necessary. \n Treatment at home \n If you're treated under supervision at home, the healthcare professional helping you\u00a0will discuss with you\u00a0changes you should make to your diet. \n Your dietary plans will depend on your individual circumstances, but it's likely you'll be advised to gradually increase your intake of energy (calories), protein, carbohydrates, fluids, and  vitamins and minerals . The aim is to reduce your risk of developing complications, such as infections, and to avoid hospital admission. \n The\u00a0 British Dietetic Association (BDA)  has produced a factsheet called  Malnutrition \u2013 overcoming the problem (PDF, 560kb) , which provides some useful practical advice. \n You may also be advised to take special nutritional supplements which can increase your energy and protein intake. You'll be helped to set targets and your progress will be regularly monitored. \n Depending on the cause of your malnutrition, you may also need additional help. For example, you may benefit from the help of a carer if poor mobility makes it difficult for you to shop for food or cook. \n Read more about  getting care at home  \n If you\u00a0have problems swallowing food or drink ( dysphagia ), you may be referred to a speech and language therapist (SLT) who can assess your swallowing and offer advice about a special diet that can help. \n If you can't eat enough to meet your body's needs, an artificial method of feeding may be required, such as a feeding tube. These are fitted in hospital but can be used at home (see below).\u00a0 \n Treatment in hospital \n You'll be seen by a number of healthcare professionals if you're admitted to hospital with malnutrition. They may include: \n \n a doctor who specialises in treating digestive conditions (a gastroenterologist) \n a dietitian \n a nurse who specialises in nutrition\u00a0 \n a social worker \n \n If you don't have problems swallowing food, dietary changes may be recommended, with or without nutritional supplements. \n If you're unable to swallow food you may need a feeding tube. There are two types of feeding tubes: \n \n a nasogastric tube \u2013 a tube that's passed down your nose and into your stomach \n a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube \u2013 a tube that's surgically placed directly into your stomach through your abdomen (tummy) \n \n Parenteral nutrition \n If a feeding tube isn't suitable, it may be necessary to deliver nutrition directly into your bloodstream through a drip into your vein. This is known as parenteral nutrition and it allows you to receive nutrients that you can't get through eating. \n You'll be prescribed a solution that's tailored to your individual dietary needs. The solution may include a combination of nutrients, including carbohydrates and sugars, proteins, fats, electrolytes (salts) and a variety of vitamins and minerals. \n Additional treatment \n The underlying cause of your malnutrition may also need to be treated. \n The amount of time you'll spend in hospital will depend on your general state of health and what's causing your malnutrition. In some cases it may be possible to return home while receiving treatment. \n Treating children \n In the UK, many cases of malnutrition in children are caused by long-term health conditions and hospital treatment is often required. \n Childhood malnutrition can sometimes be treated with additional nutrients. Your child may need to take special supplements and eat foods high in energy and nutrients. The underlying cause of their malnutrition may also need to be treated. \n Severely malnourished children need to be fed and rehydrated with great care and so can't be given a normal diet straight away. Once their condition stabilises they can gradually be introduced to a normal diet. \n Malnutrition due to lack of food is a child protection issue, which means the police and social services need to be informed.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Several factors are taken into account to check whether someone is malnourished or at a high risk of malnutrition. \n In adults, these include: \n \n body mass index (BMI)\u00a0\u2013 a measure that can be used to determine if you're a healthy weight for your\u00a0height \n whether you've unintentionally lost weight in recent months \n whether an illness means you're unable to feed yourself or absorb nutrients from your diet \n \n You would normally be considered malnourished if you have a BMI of less than 18.5 or you've unintentionally lost more than 5% of your body weight during the last three to six months. However, in some cases, doctors may be concerned about malnutrition if you have a BMI between 18.5 and 20. \n You\u00a0may be considered at a high risk of malnutrition if: \n \n an illness means you have eaten nothing for the last five days, or you're likely to eat nothing for the next five days \n you don't absorb nutrients from food well \u2013 for example, you have a condition, such as\u00a0 Crohn\u2019s disease , that causes the digestive system to become inflamed \n there's an underlying reason why your body is likely to use up nutrients at a higher rate or have an increased need for nutrients \n you have difficulty eating and drinking \n \n A vitamin or mineral deficiency can usually be diagnosed with a  blood test . \n Diagnosing malnutrition in children \n Diagnosing malnutrition in children involves taking a measurement of their weight and height and comparing it against the expected average height and weight for a child of that age. \n Some children will be below average because they're naturally smaller, but a significant drop below the expected level could indicate a risk of malnutrition. \n Blood tests can also be used to measure protein\u00a0levels in the blood. Low levels of protein may suggest that a child is malnourished."},

These can include: \n \n cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough \n sore,\u00a0red eyes that may be sensitive to light \n a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F) \n small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks \n \n A\u00a0few days later, a red-brown\u00a0blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the\u00a0head or upper neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of measles  \n When to see your GP \n You should contact your GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles. \n It's best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. \n You should also see your GP if you've been in close contact with someone who has measles and you've not been fully vaccinated (had two doses of the MMR vaccine) or haven't had the infection before \u2013 even if you don't have any symptoms. \n Is measles serious? \n Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass\u00a0in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. \n Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again. \n However,\u00a0measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs  (pneumonia)  and brain (encephalitis). \n Read more about the  complications of measles  \n How measles is spread \n The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. \n You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours. \n People\u00a0with measles\u00a0are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about four days after the rash first appears. \n How measles can be prevented \n Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. \n This is given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 12 months old and a second dose is given from age 3 years 4 months. \n Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they haven't been fully vaccinated before. Ask your GP about having the vaccination. \n If the MMR vaccine isn't suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles. \n Read more about  preventing measles  \n Treating measles \n There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection, including: \n \n taking\u00a0 paracetamol  or\u00a0 ibuprofen  to relieve fever, aches and pains\u00a0\u2013 aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old \n drinking plenty of water to avoid  dehydration  \n closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity \n using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes \n staying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears \n \n In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. \n Read more about  treating measles", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Lymphoedema", "introduction": "Lymphoedema is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs. \n Other symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them. \n Lymphoedema can get worse if it's not treated, so you should speak to a doctor if you think you may have the condition. \n Read more about the  symptoms of lymphoedema \u00a0and  diagnosing lymphoedema  \n What causes\u00a0lymphoedema? \n Lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues. \n Abnormal development of the lymphatic system, damage to it, and/or an increase in fluid in the body tissues can all lead to lymphoedema. \n There are two main types of lymphoedema: \n \n primary lymphoedema \u2013 caused by faulty genes affecting the development of the lymphatic system; it can develop at any age, but usually occurs in early adulthood \n secondary lymphoedema \u2013 caused by damage to the lymphatic system or problems with the movement and drainage of fluid in the lymphatic system, often due to an infection, injury,  cancer  treatment, inflammation of the limb or a lack of limb movement\u00a0 \n \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of lymphoedema  \n Who is affected \n A recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the UK may be living with lymphoedema.\u00a0 \n Secondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women after  breast cancer  treatment. \n Primary lymphoedema is less common than secondary lymphoedema, and is estimated to affect around one in every 6,000 people. \n How lymphoedema is treated \n There is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system. \n These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating lymphoedema  and  preventing lymphoedema  \n Complications \n The build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection. \n In particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called\u00a0 cellulitis  is commonly reported in people with the condition. \n Read more about the\u00a0 complications of lymphoedema", "symptoms": "The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight. \n At first, the swelling may come and go. It may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent. \n Other symptoms in an affected body part can include: \n \n an aching, heavy feeling \n difficulty with movement \n repeated skin infections \n the skin becoming hard and tight \n folds developing in the skin \n wart-like growths developing on the skin \n a leakage of fluid through the skin \n \n When these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition. \n If lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood. \n In these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time \u2013 particularly the lower leg. \n If lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. For example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for\u00a0 breast cancer , lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years. \n Read more about the  causes of lymphoedema  \n When to seek medical advice \n If you are at risk of developing lymphoedema because you have had treatment for\u00a0 cancer , you may be offered an assessment for the condition as part of your treatment aftercare plan. Speak to your consultant or specialist nurse if you have any concerns. \n If you think you may have lymphoedema, but not as a result of treatment for cancer, see your GP. \n Read more about  diagnosing lymphoedema", "causes": "There are two types of lymphoedema, called primary and secondary lymphoedema, which have different causes. \n The main causes of primary and secondary lymphoedema are outlined below. \n Primary lymphoedema \n Primary lymphoedema is caused by alterations (known as mutations) in genes responsible for the development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that help fight infection and remove excess fluid from the body). \n These \"faulty\" genes result in the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining fluid not developing properly or not working as they should. \n Primary lymphoedema usually runs in families, but not every child born to someone with the condition will develop it themselves.\u00a0 \n Secondary lymphoedema \n Secondary lymphoedema develops in people who previously had a normal lymphatic system. \n It can have a number of different causes. Some of the most common causes are explained below. \n Surgical treatment of cancer \n  Cancer  cells can spread around the body through the lymphatic system, so part of the treatment for the condition can involve surgically removing sections of the lymphatic system potentially containing cancerous cells. \n Although the surgeon will try to ensure limited damage to your lymphatic system, this isn't always possible. \n There is a particular risk of lymphoedema occurring as a complication of treatment for: \n \n  breast cancer  \n  melanoma skin cancer  \n gynaecological cancers \u2013 such as  cervical cancer \u00a0and  vulval cancer  \n genitourinary cancers \u2013 such\u00a0as  prostate cancer  or  penile cancer  \n \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous tissue, but it can also damage healthy tissue. \n If it's necessary to use radiotherapy to destroy cancerous cells in your lymphatic system, there is a risk that the system could become permanently damaged and unable to drain fluid properly. \n Infections \n In some cases, an infection can cause lymphoedema. \n  Cellulitis  is a bacterial skin infection that can cause lymphoedema. Severe cellulitis can damage the tissue around the lymphatic system, causing it to become scarred. \n Another infectious cause of lymphoedema is a parasitic infection called filariasis. This is a common cause of lymphoedema worldwide, but is not a risk in the UK. \n Inflammation \n Conditions that cause tissue to become inflamed (red and swollen) can also permanently damage the lymphatic system. Medical conditions that can cause lymphoedema include: \n \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \u2013 which causes pain and swelling in the joints \n  eczema  \u2013 which causes the skin to become itchy, reddened, dry and cracked \n \n Venous diseases\u00a0 \n Venous diseases, which affect the flow of blood through the veins, can cause lymphoedema in some people. The abnormal or damaged veins can result in excessive fluid leaking from the blood into the tissue spaces. This overwhelms and eventually exhausts the parts of the lymphatic system responsible for draining this fluid. \n Some venous diseases that can lead to lymphoedema include: \n \n  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  \u2013 a blood clot in one of the deep veins in the body \n  varicose veins  (swollen and enlarged veins) \u2013 where poor drainage of blood in the veins causes higher vein pressure, and more fluid passes into the surrounding tissues \n \n Obesity \n People who are obese, particularly those who are severely obese, have an increased risk of developing lymphoedema. It\u2019s not clear exactly why this is, but it has been suggested that the extra fatty tissue affects the lymphatic channels in some way, reducing the flow of fluid through them. \n In these cases, weight loss is an important part of treatment and even just starting to lose weight can make a big difference. \n Trauma and injury \n In a small number of cases, lymphoedema can be caused by an accidental injury to the lymphatic system. For example, lymphoedema can sometimes occur after extensive soft tissue loss or bruising. \n Immobility \n Movement and exercise helps lymph drainage, as muscle activity surrounding the lymphatic vessels massages fluid into and along them. Therefore, reduced movement can lead to lymphoedema, because the fluid in the lymphatic system does not get moved on, causing swelling. \n For example, people who are unable to move fully for a long time due to an illness or surgery may be at risk of lymphoedema.", "treatment": "The recommended treatment for lymphoedema is decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT). \n DLT is not a cure for lymphoedema, but it can help control the symptoms. Although it takes time and effort, the treatment can be used to effectively control your lymphoedema. \n Decongestive lymphatic therapy (DLT) \n There are four components to DLT: \n \n compression bandages and garments \u2013 to move fluid out of the affected limb and minimise further build-up \n skin care \u2013 to keep the skin in good condition and reduce the chances of infection \n exercises \u2013 to use muscles in the affected limb to improve lymph drainage \n specialised massage techniques \u2013 known as manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) \u2013 to stimulate the flow of fluid in the lymphatic system and reduce swelling \n \n Each of these components is described in more detail below. \n DLT usually begins with an intensive phase of therapy, during which you may receive daily treatment for several weeks to help reduce the volume of the affected body part. \n This is followed by the second phase, known as the maintenance phase. During this, you will be encouraged to take over your own care by carrying out simple self-massage techniques, wearing compression garments and continuing to exercise. This phase of treatment aims to maintain the reduced size of the affected body part. \n You may then have reviews every few months to check how your treatment is progressing. \n Compression bandages and garments \n Unlike the blood circulation system, there is no central pump, such as the heart, to move fluid around the lymphatic system. Instead, the lymphatic system uses the massaging effect of surrounding muscles to move the fluid. \n If you have lymphoedema, you will have special bandages or garments (such as sleeves, gloves, stockings or tights) fitted over any affected limbs. These will support the affected muscles during exercise and encourage them to move fluid out of the affected limb. \n These may also be applied after a session of MLD, to prevent fluid accumulating in the limb again. This use of compression bandages and garments is known as multilayer lymphoedema bandaging. \n Velcro wraps may be used instead of bandages and have the advantage that the person with lymphoedema can apply them themselves. \n You will be taught how to correctly apply your own bandages and compression garments, so you can continue to use them during the maintenance period. \n Skin care \n Taking good care of your skin is important, because it will reduce your risk of developing an infection, such as  cellulitis . \n Read our page on  preventing lymphoedema  for more skin care advice. \n Movement and exercises \n Your lymphoedema care team will help devise an exercise and movement plan designed to strengthen and stimulate the muscles involved in lymph drainage. They will also help you to lose weight, if you are overweight. This will be tailored to your requirements and ability. \n Your plan may involve specific limb exercises, as well as gentle activities that involve the whole body, such as swimming, cycling and walking. \n Massage \n To begin with, you may receive specialised massages called manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) \u2013 usually carried out by a specialist therapist \u2013 to move fluid from the swollen areas into working lymph nodes, where it can be drained. \n Your lymphoedema therapist will also teach you a range of simpler massage techniques that you or your carer can use during the maintenance phase of treatment, to help keep the swelling down. These self-massage techniques are known as simple lymphatic drainage (SLD). \n Surgery \n In a small number of cases, surgery may be considered to treat lymphoedema. There are three main types of surgery that may be useful for the condition: \n \n the removal of sections of excess skin and underlying tissue (debulking) \n the removal of fat from the affected limb (liposuction) \u2013 see below \n the restoration of the flow of fluid around the affected section of the lymphatic system \u2013 for example, by connecting the lymphatic system to nearby blood vessels (lymphaticovenular anastomosis) \n \n These treatments may help to reduce the size of areas of the body affected by lymphoedema, but some are still experimental \u2013 particularly lymphaticovenular anastomosis \u2013 and are not in widespread use. \n Liposuction \n Liposuction is where a thin tube is inserted through small incisions in the skin to suck fat out of tissue. It can be used to remove excess fat from an affected limb to help reduce its size. \n Once the surgery is complete, you will have to wear a compression garment on the affected limb day and night for at least a year to help keep the swelling down. \n The  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  states that liposuction for chronic (long-term) lymphoedema appears to be safe, and may be effective in the short term. However, NICE says there is not enough evidence of its long-term effectiveness and safety. \n Access to liposuction for lymphoedema may be limited, depending on what is available from your local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you're being treated for cancer and are at risk of developing lymphoedema, you'll be monitored for the condition afterwards. Otherwise, see your GP if you experience symptoms of swelling. \n There are a number of specialist lymphoedema treatment centres in the UK. Your doctor may refer you to one of these for further assessment. A list of treatment centres near you is available from the Lymphoedema Support Network. \n In many cases, it's possible to make a diagnosis of lymphoedema by: \n \n asking about your symptoms and medical history \n examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it's enlarged\u00a0 \n \n Further tests \n Although not necessary in most cases, further tests may occasionally be used to assess and monitor your condition. These tests are explained below. \n Measuring limb volume \n In some cases, tests to calculate the volume of an affected limb may be carried out. These may include: \n \n a tape measure to measure the circumference of the limb at certain intervals, to calculate its volume \n water displacement \u2013 where you place the affected limb in a tank of water and the amount of water that is displaced is measured to calculate the volume of the limb \n perometry \u2013 infrared light is used to measure the outline of an affected limb and calculate its volume \n \n Bioimpedance testing \n During a bioimpedance test, electrodes (small metallic discs) are placed on different parts of your body. The electrodes release a small and painless electric charge that is measured using a handheld device. Changes in the strength of the current can indicate the presence of fluid in your tissue. \n Imaging tests \n Imaging tests may also be used to help diagnose and monitor lymphoedema. These include: \n \n a lymphoscintigraph \u2013 you are injected with a radioactive dye that can be tracked using a special scanner; this shows how the dye moves through your lymphatic system and can check for any blockages \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013 which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of your body\u00a0 \n an  ultrasound scan  \u2013 which uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \u2013 which uses\u00a0 X-rays  and a computer to create detailed images of the lymph nodes \n \n These scans can be used to create a clearer picture of the affected tissue."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Malignant brain tumour (cancerous)", "introduction": "A malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine. \n Generally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. A malignant brain tumour is either grade 3 or 4, whereas grade 1 or 2 tumours are usually classed as benign or non-cancerous.\u00a0 \n Most malignant tumours are secondary cancers, which means they started in another part of the body and spread to the brain. Primary brain tumours are those that started in the brain. \n These pages focus on high-grade brain tumours. For information about grade\u00a01 or\u00a02 tumours, read our pages on\u00a0 low-grade (benign) brain tumours . \n Signs and\u00a0symptoms \n The symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. \n Common symptoms include: \n \n severe, persistent\u00a0 headaches  \n seizures (fits) \n persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness \n mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality \n progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems \n \n See your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of\u00a0malignant brain tumours \u00a0and  diagnosing\u00a0malignant brain tumours . \n Types of malignant tumours \n Most\u00a0malignant brain tumours develop from the glial\u00a0tissue, which supports the brain's nerve cells.\u00a0These tumours are known as\u00a0gliomas. \n Gliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from. For example: \n \n an astrocytoma develops from cells thought to provide the brain's framework \n an oligodendroglioma develops from the cells that produce the fatty covering of nerves \n an ependymoma develops from the cells that line the cavities in the brain \n \n It's also possible to have a malignant tumour that's a mixture of these types or developed in a different part of the brain. \n Who is affected \n Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. \n Around\u00a05,000 people are diagnosed with a\u00a0primary malignant brain tumour in the UK each year. Many others are diagnosed with secondary tumours. \n The exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it's thought that certain genetic conditions and previous\u00a0 radiotherapy  treatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of malignant brain tumours . \n How malignant brain tumours are treated \n A primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord. \n Surgery will usually need to be carried out to remove as much of the tumour as possible. This may be\u00a0followed by\u00a0radiotherapy\u00a0and/or  chemotherapy \u00a0to kill any cancerous cells left behind and reduce the chances of the tumour regrowing. \n However, malignant tumours will often eventually return after treatment. If this happens, or if you have a secondary tumour, a cure isn't usually possible and treatment can instead be used to improve symptoms and prolong life. \n Read\u00a0more about  treating malignant brain tumours . \n Living with a brain tumour \n Living with a brain tumour is not easy.\u00a0You may feel\u00a0worried and anxious about what's going to happen to you and your family. This is perfectly normal. \n It can help to seek accurate medical information about your specific tumour and its treatment, make sure you're closely involved in decisions about your care, and ask your care team about anything you're not sure about. \n You can read more about living with a brain tumour on  The Brain Tumour Charity's website . \n Your doctor\u00a0may be able to\u00a0refer you to a counsellor if you want to talk about the emotional aspects of diagnosis and treatment. There are also many organisations and helplines that can help, such as\u00a0 The Brain Tumour Charity  and  Brain Tumour Research . \n Support for carers \n Being a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. \n Research on carers\u2019 health shows that high numbers of carers suffer health effects through caring. If you are trying to combine caring with a paid job or looking after a family, this can cause even more stress. \n However, neglecting your own health doesn't work in the long term. If you're caring for someone else, it\u2019s important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you are caring for. \n For more information on the support available to you and benefits you may be entitled to, visit\u00a0 Care Information Scotland . \n Recovery and outlook \n The outcome for malignant primary brain tumours depends on a number of things, such as the type and location of the tumour, your age, and how ill you were when diagnosed. \n Overall,\u00a0around 40% of people live at least a year, about 19%\u00a0live\u00a0at least\u00a0five years, and around 14%\u00a0live\u00a0at least 10 years. \n If treatment is successful, you may still be left with some persistent problems, such as\u00a0seizures, walking difficulties, or speech problems. You may need supportive treatment to help you recover from or adapt to these problems. \n You'll also need regular follow-up appointments to check if the tumour has started to come back. \n Read more about  recovering from treatment for a malignant brain tumour .", "symptoms": "The symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. \n When symptoms do occur, it is because the brain tumour is either putting pressure on the brain or preventing an area of the brain from functioning properly. \n Signs of increased pressure on the brain \n Common symptoms of increased pressure within the skull include: \n \n severe, persistent\u00a0 headaches  \u2013 which are typically worse in the morning or when bending over or coughing \n persistent nausea and vomiting \n drowsiness \n vision problems \u2013 such as\u00a0blurred vision,\u00a0floaters and\u00a0loss of vision that may come and go \n seizures (fits) \u2013 which may affect the whole body or just involve a twitch in one area \n \n Symptoms caused by the position of the tumour \n Different areas of the brain control different functions, so the symptoms caused by a brain tumour will depend on where the tumour is located. For example, a tumour affecting: \n \n the frontal lobe may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body and loss of smell \n the temporal lobe may cause\u00a0forgetfulness,\u00a0language problems (aphasia) and seizures \n the parietal lobe may cause aphasia and\u00a0numbness or weakness in one side of the body \n the occipital lobe may cause loss of vision on one side \n the cerebellum may cause a loss of co-ordination, flickering of the eyes, vomiting and a stiff neck \n the brain stem may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing ( dysphagia ) \n \n When to see your GP \n It's important to see a doctor if you develop persistent and worrying symptoms that may be caused by a brain tumour. While it's unlikely that you have a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. \n If your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan. \n Read more about  diagnosing\u00a0malignant brain tumours .", "causes": "Most malignant brain tumours are caused by a cancer that started somewhere else in the body and spread to the brain, through the bloodstream. These are known as secondary tumours. \n Cancers that can spread to the brain include  lung cancer ,  breast cancer ,  bowel cancer  and  melanoma skin cancer . \n Some primary malignant brain cancers\u00a0(cancerous tumours that start in the brain) are caused by a previously\u00a0 benign brain tumour  becoming cancerous, but usually the exact reason why a primary\u00a0tumour develops is unknown. \n Who's most at risk? \n Some of the things that can increase your risk of brain tumours are outlined below. \n Age \n Brain tumours affect people of all ages, including children, but the risk tends to increase as you get older. Most tumours affect people over 50 years of age. \n Family history \n People with a family history of brain tumours may be at a slightly increased risk of developing\u00a0a brain tumour themselves. \n Radiotherapy \n If your brain is exposed to radiation during\u00a0 radiotherapy , your risk of developing\u00a0certain types of\u00a0brain tumour later on is increased. \n Genetic conditions \n Some genetic conditions can increase your risk of a brain tumour, such as: \n \n neurofibromatosis type 1\u00a0or\u00a0neurofibromatosis type 2 \n tuberous sclerosis\u00a0 \n Turcot syndrome \n Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome \n von Hippel-Lindau syndrome \n Gorlin syndrome \n \n Unlike most brain tumours, tumours associated with these conditions tend to develop\u00a0in childhood or early adulthood. \n Can mobile phones cause brain tumours? \n There have been\u00a0reports in the media about a possible connection between brain tumours and the radiofrequency (RF) energy emitted by mobile phones. RF energy produces heat, which can increase body temperature and damage tissue exposed to it. \n However, it's thought that the amount of RF energy people are exposed to from mobile phones is too low to produce significant tissue heating or an increase in body temperature. \n Research is underway to establish whether RF energy has any long-term health effects, but the balance of evidence currently available suggests that it's unlikely\u00a0mobile phones cause health problems.", "treatment": "If you have a malignant brain tumour, you'll usually need surgery to remove as much of it as possible. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may then be used to treat any remaining cancerous tissue. \n The aim of this is to remove or destroy as much of the tumour as possible, ideally getting rid of the\u00a0cancerous cells completely. However, this isn't always possible and most\u00a0malignant\u00a0brain tumours will eventually return after treatment. \n If your tumour does return after treatment, or you\u00a0have a secondary brain tumour (where cancer has spread to your brain from another part of your body), a cure isn't usually possible. Treatment\u00a0can instead\u00a0be used\u00a0to control your symptoms and\u00a0prolong life. \n Your treatment plan \n There are a number of different treatments for\u00a0malignant brain tumours, and deciding on what you feel is the best treatment can be confusing. \n A group of different specialists called a multidisciplinary team (MDT) will be involved in your care and will recommend what they think is the best treatment option for you, but the final decision will be yours. \n Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions that you'd like to ask. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments. \n The main treatments used are described below. \n Surgery \n Surgery will be recommended for most people with a malignant brain tumour. If the size or position of the tumour mean surgery is not possible, one or more of the treatments described below may be recommended instead. \n The main operation used to treat people with brain tumours is called a craniotomy. You will be given a\u00a0 general anaesthetic  so you are asleep while the\u00a0procedure is carried out. An area of your scalp will be shaved and a section of the skull is cut out as a flap to reveal the brain and tumour underneath. \n The surgeon can then remove as\u00a0much of the tumour as possible and secure the flap of skull back in place with metal screws. \n After surgery, treatment with\u00a0radiotherapy\u00a0and/or chemotherapy may be recommended to kill any cancer cells left behind and reduce the risk of the tumour coming back.\u00a0 \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0is a treatment where a beam of\u00a0high-energy radiation\u00a0is focused on the tumour to kill the cancerous cells. It can be used after surgery or as the main treatment for tumours that\u00a0are difficult to remove. \n Radiotherapy is\u00a0usually given in several doses (fractions) spread over the course of a week. An entire course of treatment will usually last up to six weeks in total. \n Possible side effects of radiotherapy for a brain tumour include nausea, temporary hair loss, tiredness and red, sore skin. Read more about the  side effects of radiotherapy . \n In a small\u00a0number of cases, a similar treatment called\u00a0proton beam therapy may be recommended. However, this is only suitable in very specific cases and currently you'll need to be referred\u00a0for treatment abroad if your doctor thinks it's appropriate. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy  is medication used to kill cancerous cells. It may be\u00a0used alongside radiotherapy or on its\u00a0own, either\u00a0to help kill any cancerous cells left\u00a0behind after surgery or to help relieve your symptoms when a cure is not possible. \n Chemotherapy medication for brain tumours can be given in a number of ways, including as: \n \n tablets (orally) \u2013\u00a0temozolomide and procarbazine\u00a0are given in this way \n injections into a vein (intravenously) \u2013\u00a0vincristine is given in this way \n small, disc-like\u00a0implants placed in the brain during surgery \u2013 carmustine\u00a0can be\u00a0given in this way, but is\u00a0only recommended if\u00a090% or more of the tumour has been\u00a0removed \n \n The side effects of chemotherapy largely depend on the specific medication you're taking. Common general side effects include tiredness, headaches, temporary hair loss and nausea. Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy . \n For more information about some of the treatments used, see the guidelines from the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on  carmustine implants to treat gliomas \u00a0and  temozolomide for recurrent malignant glioma . \n Radiosurgery \n  Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) \u00a0is a special type of radiotherapy that's sometimes used to treat brain tumours that can't be safely removed with surgery. \n During the treatment, several small beams of radiation are used to very accurately\u00a0deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour,\u00a0usually in a single treatment session.\u00a0 \n As the radiation beams can be aimed very precisely, a high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumour with minimal damage to the surrounding healthy cells. \n This means you're less likely to experience many of the usual side effects of radiotherapy. Recovery\u00a0tends to be much faster\u00a0and an overnight stay isn't usually\u00a0necessary. \n However, radiosurgery is currently only available in a few specialised centres across the UK and is only suitable for certain people, based on the characteristics of their tumour. \n Treating symptoms \n You may also be given medication to relieve some of the symptoms you may\u00a0have as a result of your\u00a0brain tumour. \n These may include: \n \n anticonvulsants to prevent seizures (fits) \n  corticosteroids  to reduce\u00a0swelling and pressure in the brain \n painkillers to treat\u00a0 headaches  \n anti-emetics to prevent vomiting \n \n Depending on your circumstances, these medications may be given before, after, or instead of surgery. \n Choosing not to have treatment \n If your tumour is at an advanced stage or in a difficult place in the brain, a cure may not be possible and treatment may only be able to control the cancer for a period of time. This means you will be getting the side effects of treatment without getting rid of the tumour. \n In this situation, it may be difficult to decide whether or not to go ahead with treatment. Talk to your doctor about what will happen if you choose not to be treated, so you can make an informed decision. \n If you decide not to have treatment, you will still be given  palliative care , which will control your symptoms and make you as comfortable as possible.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you develop any of the  symptoms of a malignant brain tumour , such as a persistent and severe headache. \n Your GP will\u00a0examine you and ask about your symptoms. They may also carry out a simple neurological examination (see below). \n If they suspect you may have a tumour, or they are not sure what's causing your symptoms, you'll probably be referred to a neurologist (brain and nerve specialist). \n Neurological examination \n Your GP or neurologist may\u00a0carry out a test of your nervous system, called a neurological examination, to look for problems associated with a\u00a0brain tumour. \n This\u00a0may involve tests of your: \n \n hand and limb strength \n reflexes, such as your knee-jerk reflex \n hearing and vision \n skin sensitivity \n balance and co-ordination \n memory and mental agility (using simple questions or arithmetic) \n \n A neurologist may also recommend one or more of the tests mentioned below. \n Further tests \n Other tests you may have to help diagnose a brain tumour include: \n \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan \u00a0\u2013 this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a series of X-rays \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0\u2013 this produces a detailed picture of your brain using a strong magnetic field and radio waves\u00a0\u00a0 \n an  electroencephalogram (EEG) \u00a0\u2013 where electrodes attached to your scalp record your brain activity to look for any abnormalities \n \n If a tumour is suspected, a  biopsy  (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue) may be taken to establish the type of tumour and the most effective treatment. \n Under anaesthetic, a small hole (known as a burr hole) is made in the skull and a very fine needle is used to obtain a sample of tumour tissue. You'll probably need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Lyme disease", "introduction": "Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. \n Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and heath areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans. Ticks that carry the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease are found throughout the UK and in other parts of\u00a0Europe and North America. \n Lyme disease\u00a0can often be treated effectively if it's detected early on. But if it's not treated or treatment is delayed, there's a risk you could develop severe and long-lasting symptoms. \n This page covers: \n  Signs and symptoms of Lyme disease  \n  When to see your GP  \n  How you get Lyme disease  \n  Who's at risk and where are ticks found?  \n  Treating Lyme disease  \n  Preventing Lyme disease  \n  How to remove a tick  \n  Chronic Lyme disease  \n  Further information  \n Signs and symptoms of Lyme disease \n Early symptoms \n Many people with\u00a0early-stage Lyme disease develop a distinctive circular rash at the site of the tick bite, usually around\u00a0three to 30 days after being bitten. This is known as erythema migrans. \n The rash is often described as looking like a bull's-eye on a dart board. The affected area of skin will be red and the edges may feel slightly raised. \n The size of the rash can\u00a0vary significantly and it may expand over several days or weeks. Typically it's\u00a0around 15cm (6 inches) across, but it can be much larger or smaller than this. Some people may develop several rashes in different parts of their body. \n However,\u00a0around one in three people with Lyme disease won't develop this rash. \n Some people with Lyme disease also experience\u00a0 flu-like symptoms  in the early stages, such as tiredness (fatigue), muscle pain, joint pain,  headaches , a high temperature (fever), chills and neck stiffness. \n Later symptoms \n More serious symptoms may develop several weeks, months or even years later if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early on. These\u00a0can include: \n \n pain and swelling in the joints (inflammatory  arthritis ) \n problems affecting the nervous system \u2013 such as\u00a0numbness and pain in your limbs, paralysis of your facial muscles, memory problems and difficulty concentrating \n heart problems \u2013 such as\u00a0inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or sac surrounding the heart (pericarditis),  heart block \u00a0and\u00a0 heart failure  \n inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ) \u2013 which can cause\u00a0a severe headache, a stiff neck and increased sensitivity to light \n \n Some of these\u00a0problems will get better slowly with treatment, although they can persist if treatment is started late. \n A few people with Lyme disease go on to develop\u00a0long-term symptoms similar to those of  fibromyalgia  or  chronic fatigue syndrome .\u00a0This is known as post-infectious Lyme disease. It's not clear exactly why this happens, but it's likely to be related to overactivity of your immune system rather than persistent infection. \n When to see your GP \n You should see your GP if you develop any of the symptoms described above after being bitten by a tick, or if you think you may have been bitten. Make sure you let your GP know if you've spent time in woodland or heath areas where ticks are known to live. \n Diagnosing Lyme disease is often difficult as many of the symptoms are similar to other conditions. A spreading rash some days after a known tick bite should be treated with appropriate antibiotics without waiting for the results of a blood test. \n  Blood tests  can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis after a few weeks, but these can be negative in the early stages of the infection. You may need to be re-tested if Lyme disease is still suspected after a negative test result. \n In the UK, two types of blood test are used to ensure Lyme disease is diagnosed accurately. This is because a single blood test can sometimes produce a positive result even when a person doesn't have the infection. \n If you have post-infectious Lyme disease or long-lasting symptoms, you may see a specialist in microbiology or infectious diseases. They can arrange\u00a0for blood samples to be sent to the national reference laboratory run by Public Health England (PHE), where further tests for other tick-borne infections can be carried out. \n How you get Lyme disease \n If a tick bites an animal carrying the bacteria\u00a0that cause Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), the tick\u00a0can also become infected. The tick can then transfer the bacteria to a human by biting them. \n Ticks can be found in any areas with deep or overgrown vegetation where they have access to animals to feed on. \n They're common in woodland and heath areas, but can also be found in gardens or parks. \n Ticks\u00a0don't jump or fly, but climb on to your clothes or skin if you brush against something they're on. They then bite into the skin and start to feed on your blood. \n Generally, you're more likely to become infected\u00a0if the tick remains attached to your skin for more than\u00a024 hours. But ticks are very small and their bites are not painful, so you may not realise you have one attached to your skin. \n Who's at risk and where are ticks found? \n People who spend time in woodland or heath areas in the UK and parts of Europe or North America are most at risk of developing Lyme disease. \n Most tick bites happen in late spring, early summer and autumn because these are the times of year when most people take part in outdoor activities, such as hiking and camping. \n Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but the Scottish highlands is known to have a particularly high population of ticks. \n It's thought only a small proportion of ticks carry the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, so being bitten doesn't mean you'll definitely be infected. However, it's important to be aware of the risk and seek medical advice if you start to feel unwell. \n Treating Lyme disease \n If you develop symptoms of Lyme disease, you will normally be given a course of\u00a0 antibiotic \u00a0tablets, capsules or liquid. Most people will require a two- to four-week course, depending on the stage of the condition. \n If you are prescribed antibiotics, it's important you finish the course even if you are feeling better, because this will help ensure all the bacteria are killed. \n If your symptoms are particularly severe, you may be referred to a specialist\u00a0to have\u00a0antibiotic injections (intravenous antibiotics). \n Some of the antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. In these cases, you should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and not use sunbeds until after you have finished the treatment. \n There's currently no clear consensus on the best treatment for post-infectious Lyme disease because the underlying cause is not yet clear. Be wary of internet sites offering alternative diagnostic tests and treatments that may not be supported by scientific evidence. \n Preventing Lyme disease \n There is currently no vaccine available to prevent Lyme disease. The best way to prevent the\u00a0condition is to be aware of the risks when you visit areas where ticks are found and to take sensible precautions. \n You can reduce the risk of infection by: \n \n keeping to footpaths and avoiding long grass when out\u00a0walking \n wearing appropriate clothing in tick-infested areas (a long-sleeved shirt and trousers tucked into your socks) \n wearing light-coloured fabrics that may help you spot a tick on your clothes \n using insect repellent on exposed skin \n inspecting your skin for ticks, particularly at the end of the day, including your head, neck and skin folds (armpits, groin, and waistband) \u2013 remove any ticks you find promptly \n checking your children's head and neck areas, including their scalp \n making sure ticks are not brought home on your clothes \n checking that pets do not bring ticks into your home in their fur \n \n How to remove a tick \n If you find a tick on your or your child's skin, remove it by gently gripping it as close to the skin as possible, preferably using fine-toothed tweezers. Pull steadily away from the skin without twisting or crushing the tick. \n Wash your skin with water and soap afterwards, and apply an antiseptic cream to\u00a0the skin around the bite. \n Don't use a lit cigarette end, a match head or substances such as alcohol or petroleum jelly to force the tick out. \n Some veterinary surgeries and pet shops sell inexpensive tick removal devices, which may be useful if you frequently spend time in areas where there are ticks. \n \"Chronic Lyme disease\" \n There has recently been a lot of focus on Lyme disease in the media, with much attention on people who've been diagnosed with \"chronic Lyme disease\". \n This term has been used by some people to describe persistent symptoms such as tiredness, aches and pains, usually in the absence of a confirmed Lyme disease infection. It's different to \"post-infectious Lyme disease\" (see above), which is used to describe persistent symptoms after a confirmed and treated infection. \n It's important to be aware that a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease is controversial. Experts do not agree on whether the condition exists, or whether the symptoms are actually caused by a different, undiagnosed problem. \n In either case, there's no evidence to suggest people diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease can pass the condition on to others, and there's little clear evidence about how best to treat it.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects. \n However, the term \"lupus\" is most often used to describe a more severe form of the condition called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. \n Symptoms range from mild to severe, and many people will have long periods with few or no symptoms before experiencing a sudden flare-up, where their symptoms are particularly severe. \n Even mild cases can be distressing and have a considerable impact on a person\u2019s quality of life. \n The rest of this article will focus on SLE. \n Signs and symptoms \n SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are: \n \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n rashes \u2013 particularly on the face, wrists and hands \n joint pain\u00a0and swelling \n \n As the\u00a0symptoms of SLE can be similar to a number of other conditions, many of which are more common, it can be difficult to diagnose. \n If you\u00a0have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE, you should see your GP so they can try to determine the cause. \n Read more about the  symptoms of lupus \u00a0and  diagnosing lupus .\u00a0 \n What causes lupus? \n SLE\u00a0is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs. \n As with other more common autoimmune conditions, such as  rheumatoid arthritis , it is thought a combination of genetic and environmental factors\u00a0may be\u00a0responsible for triggering\u00a0SLE in certain people. \n Read more\u00a0about the  causes of lupus . \n Who is affected \n SLE is an uncommon condition that is estimated to affect around 15,000 people in England and Wales. \n Around 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages. \n The condition tends to be less common in people of white European origin and more common in those of African, Caribbean or Asian origin. \n How\u00a0lupus is treated \n There is currently no cure for SLE, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage. \n These medications include: \n \n hydroxychloroquine \u2013 a medicine that has historically been used to treat\u00a0 malaria , but can also help treat some symptoms of SLE \n  corticosteroids  \u2013 anti-inflammatory medications \n immunosuppressants \u2013 a group of medicines that suppress your immune system \n \n With good levels of support from friends, family and healthcare professionals, many people with SLE are able to manage their condition effectively. \n Read more\u00a0about  treating lupus . \n Outlook \n A few decades ago SLE was regarded as a terminal condition, as many people would die of an associated complication within a few years of being diagnosed. \n As a result of early diagnosis and advances in treatment, however, the outlook for SLE is now much better. The vast majority of people diagnosed with the condition will have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. \n However, some people with SLE are still at risk of life-threatening complications as a result of damage to internal organs and tissues, such as  heart attack \u00a0or\u00a0 stroke . SLE, and some of the treatments for it, can also increase your risk of developing potentially serious infections. \n Read more about the  complications of lupus .", "symptoms": "Symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can vary widely from person to person. Some people may only experience a few mild symptoms, whereas others may be more severely affected. \n Even if you usually have mild symptoms, SLE can \"flare-up\", with symptoms becoming more severe or new symptoms developing. \n Main\u00a0symptoms \n The 3\u00a0main symptoms of SLE are fatigue, joint pain and\u00a0rashes. \n Fatigue \n Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of SLE. You may feel very tired even though you\u00a0get plenty of sleep. Carrying out everyday tasks, such as housework or office work, can leave you feeling exhausted. \n Many people with SLE find that fatigue is the most distressing and disruptive aspect of SLE because it has a negative impact on\u00a0their work and social life. \n Joint pain \n If you have SLE, you are likely to experience joint pain in your hands and feet. You may find the pain changes from one set of joints to another quite quickly, and is usually worse in the morning. \n Unlike some other conditions that affect the joints, SLE is unlikely to cause your joints to become permanently damaged or deformed. \n Rashes \n Many people with SLE develop rashes on their skin \u2013 most commonly on the face, wrists and hands. A rash over the cheeks and the bridge of the nose is particularly common and is known as a \"butterfly rash\" or \"malar rash\". \n Rashes caused by SLE may\u00a0get better\u00a0after a few days or weeks, but can last longer or even be permanent. \n Rashes caused by SLE can sometimes be itchy or painful, and they may get worse if they are exposed to sunlight. This is known as \"photosensitivity\". \n Other symptoms \n SLE can also cause a wide range of symptoms.\u00a0However, you're unlikely\u00a0to have all of the symptoms listed below, and many people with the condition will only experience\u00a0the main symptoms. \n Other\u00a0features of SLE may include: \n \n a fever (high temperature) \n  swollen lymph glands \u00a0(small glands found throughout your body, including in your neck, armpits and groin) \n recurring\u00a0 mouth ulcers  \n hair loss\u00a0(alopecia) \n  high blood pressure \u00a0(hypertension) \n  headaches \u00a0and  migraines  \n  stomach (abdominal) pain  \n chest pain \n  depression \u00a0 \n dry eyes \n memory loss \n seizures (fits) \n problems thinking clearly and difficulty telling the difference between reality and imagination ( psychosis ) \n  shortness of breath  \n  Raynaud's phenomenon  \u2013 a condition that limits the blood supply to your hands and feet\u00a0when it is cold \n ankle swelling and fluid retention (oedema) \n \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you have persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by SLE. \n While it is likely that your symptoms are being caused by a more common condition, it is important to see a doctor for a diagnosis. \n Read more about  diagnosing lupus .", "causes": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. \n The immune system is the body\u2019s natural defence against illness and infection. When the immune system detects the presence of an infectious agent, such as bacteria or a virus, it sends white blood cells and antibodies to attack it. \n In cases of SLE, antibodies released by the immune system can attack healthy tissue, cells and organs. \n It's not clear exactly why this happens, although most experts think SLE has more than one cause. It has been suggested that there may be a number of genetic factors that make people more susceptible to the condition, and that it also takes one or more environmental factors to trigger SLE in those who are susceptible. \n Possible genetic and environmental factors are discussed in more detail below. \n Genetic factors \n Brothers and sisters of people with SLE are much more likely to develop the condition than the population at large. \n Researchers have identified a number of different genetic mutations that seem to make people more susceptible to developing SLE. A genetic mutation occurs when normal instructions carried in certain genes become \"scrambled\", resulting in the body\u2019s processes not working normally. \n Most faulty genes are associated with regulating certain functions of the immune system, which may explain why the immune system in people with SLE starts to malfunction. \n Environmental factors \n A number of environmental factors may be responsible for triggering SLE in vulnerable individuals, although the evidence for many of these is limited. \n Possible environmental factors that have been suggested include: \n \n exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light) \n hormonal changes that occur during a woman\u2019s lifetime, such as during\u00a0puberty or pregnancy \n certain infections, such as by the\u00a0Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \u2013 a common viral infection that doesn't usually cause any symptoms \n smoking", "treatment": "There is currently no cure for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but treatments that can ease the symptoms and make it easier to live with are available. \n In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of self-care measures and medication. \n Protecting yourself from the sun \n Exposure to sunlight can sometimes make symptoms such as rashes worse, and it's\u00a0important to protect your skin when\u00a0in the sun. \n This means wearing clothing that covers your skin, a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses. You will also need to apply sunscreen with a high SPF to prevent sunburn. However, some people with lupus\u00a0are not sun-sensitive and do not need to take extra precautions. \n As people get most of their\u00a0vitamin D\u00a0as a result of\u00a0direct sunlight on\u00a0the skin, there is a risk you\u00a0may not get enough of this vitamin if you need to avoid sun exposure.\u00a0This means you may need to make an extra effort to include good sources of vitamin D in your diet to avoid problems such as  osteoporosis  (weakened bones), and you may be advised to take vitamin D supplements. \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  are a common painkilling medication that reduces inflammation in the body. If you experience joint or muscle pain as a result of SLE, you may be prescribed a NSAID to help ease your symptoms. \n Commonly prescribed NSAIDs for SLE include  ibuprofen , naproxen\u00a0and diclofenac. \n You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, over the counter. These NSAIDs may be suitable if your joint or muscle pain is mild. For more severe pain, you will need stronger medication prescribed by your GP. \n NSAIDs may not be suitable for people who have stomach, kidney or liver problems, or have had these problems in the past. They may also be unsuitable for people with asthma. Your GP will advise\u00a0about which NSAID is right\u00a0for you. \n Side effects \n If taken in high doses or over long periods of time, NSAIDs can damage your stomach lining, which may cause internal bleeding. \n If you need to take NSAIDs on a long-term basis, your GP will carefully monitor you to check for any problems, and you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect your stomach. \n Hydroxychloroquine \n Hydroxychloroquine\u00a0is a medicine\u00a0that has been\u00a0used to treat  malaria , but\u00a0is also effective in treating some of the symptoms of SLE, such as rashes, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue. \n You will usually have to take hydroxychloroquine for 6 to 12 weeks before you\u00a0notice any benefit. \n Most expert doctors recommend\u00a0people with SLE take hydroxychloroquine on a long-term basis as a way of controlling their symptoms, helping to prevent flare-ups and to prevent development of more serious problems from lupus. \n Side effects \n Side effects of hydroxychloroquine are uncommon, but may include  indigestion ,  diarrhoea ,\u00a0 headaches  and\u00a0rashes. \n Hydroxychloroquine may also cause more serious side effects in a small number of people. For example, in rare cases, this medicine can cause\u00a0eye damage. Contact your GP or specialist immediately if you experience vision problems while taking hydroxychloroquine. \n If your GP or specialist feels it is necessary, you may need regular eye examinations. \n Corticosteroids \n  Corticosteroids \u00a0are\u00a0a type of medicine that help reduce inflammation quickly. They can be very effective in treating symptoms of SLE, but are usually only prescribed if the condition is severe. \n If you have severe symptoms of SLE, or if you are experiencing a flare-up, you may be given a large dose of corticosteroids to help bring your symptoms under control. As your symptoms ease, your dosage can gradually be reduced. \n Side effects \n When prescribing corticosteroids, the lowest effective dosage is always given. This is because high doses or long-term use of corticosteroids can cause side effects. These may include: \n \n thinning of your bones \n thinning of your skin \n weight gain \n  high blood pressure  (hypertension) \n \n Corticosteroids are a safe and effective form of treatment, provided\u00a0they are taken correctly and under the supervision of your GP or specialist. They will tailor the steroid dose to your disease activity, to minimise side effects while effectively controlling the condition. \n Immunosuppressants \n Immunosuppressants are a type of medicine that suppress your immune system. They can help improve your symptoms of SLE by limiting the damage\u00a0your immune system causes when it attacks healthy parts of your body. \n Commonly prescribed immunosuppressant medicines include azathioprine,\u00a0methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil\u00a0and cyclophosphamide. \n Immunosuppressants are sometimes used in conjunction with corticosteroids (see above) because these medicines may ease your symptoms more effectively when used together. Alternatively, the use of immunosuppressant medication may allow your corticosteroid dose to be reduced. \n Side effects \n Immunosuppressant medication is usually only prescribed if you have severe SLE. This is because this type of medication is powerful and can cause side effects such as: \n \n loss of appetite \n vomiting \n diarrhoea \n swollen gums \n bruising or bleeding more easily \n headache \n  acne  \n extra hair growth \n weight gain \n liver damage \n an increased risk of infection (see below) \n \n Methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide can also cause birth defects if they are taken during pregnancy, so you should use a reliable form of contraception if you are taking these medications and are sexually active. If you are trying to become pregnant, an alternative medication such as azathioprine can be used. \n Tell your GP if a side effect becomes particularly troublesome, as\u00a0it may mean your dose needs to be adjusted. \n Infection risk \n Taking immunosuppressant medication can increase your risk of developing an infection. This is a particularly serious\u00a0concern for people with SLE, because the organ damage that can occur as a result\u00a0of the condition means infections are more likely to be life-threatening. \n It is therefore\u00a0very important to report any\u00a0symptoms of a possible infection to your GP immediately. \n Symptoms of infection may sometimes be similar to a flare up of\u00a0SLE and include: \n \n a fever (high temperature) \n a\u00a0 cough  or\u00a0 breathlessness  \n burning when passing urine or\u00a0passing blood in\u00a0your urine \n diarrhoea \n \n You should also try to avoid contact with anyone known to have an infection \u2013 even if it is an infection you were previously immune to, such as\u00a0 chickenpox  or  measles .\u00a0This is because your previous immunity to these conditions will probably be suppressed (lowered). \n Rituximab \n Rituximab\u00a0is a new type of medication\u00a0used in people with severe SLE\u00a0that\u00a0doesn't respond to other treatments. \n Rituximab was originally designed to treat certain types of cancer, such as  lymphoma , but it has since proved effective in treating a number of autoimmune conditions, such as SLE and  rheumatoid arthritis . \n Rituximab works by locking on to and killing cells called \"B-cells\", which produce antibodies responsible for the symptoms of SLE. It is administered directly into your vein over the course of several hours, known as an infusion. \n Rituximab is not currently licensed for treating SLE in the UK, but your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using rituximab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe\u00a0it is in treating SLE. \n Side effects \n Common side effects of rituximab include: \n \n  flu -like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature \n dizziness \n vomiting \n \n In rare cases, rituximab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins. \n Belimumab \n Belimumab is a new medication given to people with active SLE who don\u2019t respond to other treatments. \n It\u00a0works by binding to growth factors that are needed for the survival of B-cells. It is given directly into your vein over several hours, known as an infusion. The first 3\u00a0doses are given 14 days apart, and\u00a0the medication is usually given once a month thereafter. \n Belimumab is licensed for treating SLE in the UK, and there may be instances where your specialist may consider it an appropriate treatment for you. If your doctor suggests using belimumab, they should tell you that there are currently some uncertainties about how effective or safe it is in treating SLE. \n Side effects \n Common side effects of belimumab include: \n \n flu-like symptoms, such as chills and a high temperature \n nausea and diarrhoea \n headache \n difficulty sleeping ( insomnia ) \n a cough,\u00a0 sore throat  and blocked or runny nose \n joint pain \n increased risk of infections \n changes in blood pressure \n \n In rare cases, belimumab can cause a more serious allergy-like reaction. Most reactions occur during or shortly after the treatment is given, so you will be closely monitored once your treatment begins.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be difficult to diagnose, as it has similar symptoms to several other, far more common, conditions. \n Diagnosis may also be difficult\u00a0because\u00a0symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and they may change over time. For example, there may be periods where your symptoms are not very noticeable, or times when they flare up and become more severe. \n For a confident diagnosis of SLE to be made, you will need to have several  symptoms of lupus  and a number of\u00a0 blood tests  may need to be carried out. \n Blood tests \n Some of the blood tests that may be carried out are described below. \n Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test \n A blood test called the\u00a0erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test can be used to\u00a0determine whether there is any inflammation in your body. \n This can be useful in diagnosing SLE because the condition can cause\u00a0many areas of the body to become inflamed (swell), including\u00a0the joints and internal organs. \n The test works by measuring how long it takes for red blood cells to fall to the bottom of\u00a0a test tube. The quicker they fall, the more likely it is that there are high levels of inflammation. \n Anti-nuclear antibody test \n An anti-nuclear antibody test checks\u00a0whether there is a certain type of antibody cell in your blood, known as the anti-nuclear antibody. Approximately 95% of people with SLE have this antibody. \n However, it is possible to have the anti-nuclear antibody without having SLE, so the anti-nuclear antibody test is not a definitive way of testing for the condition.\u00a0Other blood tests will also be needed to confirm the diagnosis. \n Anti-DNA antibody test \n An anti-DNA test also checks for a certain type of antibody in your blood, known as the anti-DNA antibody. If you have the anti-DNA antibody, it is highly likely that you have SLE. However, the antibody is only found in around 70% of people with the condition. \n The level of anti-DNA antibodies increases when SLE is more active, so during a flare-up of symptoms your reading from this test may be greater than normal. \n Complement level test \n Complement is a chemical in the blood that forms part of your immune system.\u00a0The level of this chemical may be tested to check how active your SLE is. The level of complement in your blood decreases when SLE is more active. \n Other tests \n Once you have been diagnosed with SLE, you will normally need regular\u00a0monitoring to see\u00a0how the condition is affecting your body. \n If you have SLE it is possible you may\u00a0develop other conditions, such as kidney problems. Monitoring your condition will allow your doctor to check for these complications and, if necessary, treat them as soon as possible. \n You may need to have scans, such as an\u00a0 X-ray ,  ultrasound scan ,\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0or a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  to check whether SLE is affecting your internal organs. \n Read more about the  complications of lupus ."},

Around 44,500 people are diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK. \n There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including: \n \n a persistent cough \n coughing up blood \n persistent breathlessness \n unexplained tiredness and weight loss \n an ache or pain when breathing or coughing \n \n You should see your GP if you have these symptoms. \n Read more about the  symptoms of lung cancer  \n Types of lung cancer \n Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This\u00a0page is about\u00a0primary lung cancer. \n There are two main types of primary lung cancer.\u00a0These are classified by the type of cells in which the cancer starts. They are: \n \n non-small-cell lung cancer \u2013 the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases; can be either\u00a0squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or large-cell carcinoma \n small-cell lung cancer \u2013\u00a0a less common type that\u00a0usually spreads\u00a0faster than non-small-cell lung cancer \n \n The type of lung cancer you have determines which treatments are recommended. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing lung cancer  \n Who's affected \n Lung cancer mainly affects older people.\u00a0It's\u00a0rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly\u00a0diagnosed in people aged 70-74. \n Although people who have never smoked can develop lung cancer, smoking is the main cause (accounting for over 85% of cases). This is because smoking involves regularly inhaling a number of different toxic substances. \n Read more about: \n \n  causes of lung cancer  \n  preventing lung cancer  \n \n Treating lung cancer \n Treatment depends on the type of cancer, how far it's spread and how good your general health is. \n If the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung is usually recommended. \n If surgery is unsuitable due to your general health,\u00a0 radiotherapy \u00a0to destroy the cancerous cells may be recommended instead. \n If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective,\u00a0 chemotherapy \u00a0is usually used. \n Read more about  treating lung cancer  \n Outlook \n Lung cancer doesn't usually cause noticeable symptoms until it's spread through the lungs or into other parts of the body. This means the outlook for the condition isn't as good as many\u00a0other types of cancer. \n Overall, about 1 in 3 people with the condition live for at least a year after they're diagnosed and\u00a0about 1 in\u00a020 people live at least\u00a010 years. \n However, survival rates can vary widely, depending on how far the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis.\u00a0Early diagnosis can make a big difference. \n Read about  living with lung cancer", "symptoms": "Symptoms of lung cancer develop as the condition progresses and there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages. \n The main symptoms of lung cancer are listed below.

These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing). \n If you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker. \n While smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as  oesophageal cancer  and  mouth cancer . These products include: \n \n cigars \n pipe tobacco \n snuff (a powdered form of tobacco) \n chewing tobacco \n \n Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco.\u00a0While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer. \n It's been\u00a0estimated that smoking four joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes. \n Even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer. \n Passive smoking \n If you don't smoke, frequent exposure to other people\u2019s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer. \n For example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner. \n Radon \n Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that\u00a0comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings. \n If radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you're a smoker. Radon is estimated to be responsible for about 3% of all lung cancer deaths in England. \n Occupational exposure and pollution \n Exposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. These chemicals and substances include: \n \n arsenic \n asbestos \n beryllium \n cadmium \n coal and coke fumes \n silica \n nickel \n \n Read more information about\u00a0 asbestosis  and silicosis. \n Research\u00a0also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. One study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles). \n  Want to know more?  \n \n  Macmillan Cancer Support: Causes and risk factors for lung cancer", "treatment": "Treatment for lung cancer is carried out by a team of specialists who will work together to provide the best possible treatment. \n This team contains all the specialists required to make a proper diagnosis, to stage your cancer and to plan the best treatment. If you want to know more, ask your specialist about this. \n The type of treatment you'll receive for lung cancer depends on several factors, including: \n \n the type of lung cancer you have (non-small-cell or small-cell cancer) \n the size and position of the cancer \n how far advanced your cancer is (the stage) \n your overall health \n \n Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours. \n The main treatment options include surgery,  radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy . Depending on your type of cancer and how advanced it is, you may receive a combination of these treatments. \n Your treatment plan \n Your treatment plan depends on whether you have non-small-cell lung cancer or small-cell lung cancer. \n Non-small-cell lung cancer \n If you have non-small-cell lung cancer that's confined to one lung and you're in good general health, you'll probably have surgery to remove the cancerous cells. This may be followed by a course of chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells that may have remained in the body. \n If the cancer hasn't spread too far but surgery isn't possible (for example, if your general health means you have an increased risk of developing complications), radiotherapy to destroy the cancerous cells will usually be recommended. In some cases, this may be combined with chemotherapy (known as chemoradiotherapy). \n If the cancer has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective, chemotherapy is usually recommended. If the cancer starts to grow again after initial chemotherapy treatment, another course of treatment may be recommended. \n In some cases, a treatment called biological or targeted therapy may be recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy, or after chemotherapy. Biological therapies are medications that can control or stop the growth of cancer cells.\u00a0 \n Small-cell lung cancer \n Small-cell lung cancer is usually treated with chemotherapy, either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy. This can help to prolong life and relieve symptoms. \n Surgery isn't usually used to treat this type of lung cancer. This is\u00a0because the cancer has often already spread to other areas of the body by the time it's diagnosed. However, if the cancer is found very early, surgery may be used. In these cases, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be given after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning. \n Surgery \n There are three types of lung cancer surgery: \n \n Lobectomy \u2013\u00a0where\u00a0one\u00a0or more large parts of the lung (called lobes) are removed. Your doctors will suggest this operation if the cancer is just in one section of one lung. \n Pneumonectomy \u2013 where the entire lung is removed. This is used when the cancer is located in the middle of the lung or has spread throughout the lung. \n Wedge resection or segmentectomy \u2013 where a small piece of the lung is removed. This procedure is\u00a0only suitable for a small number of patients, as it is only used if your doctors think your cancer is small and limited to one area of the lung. This is\u00a0usually very early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. \n \n People are naturally concerned that they won't\u00a0be able to breathe if some or all of a lung is removed, but it's possible to breathe normally with one lung. However, if you have breathing problems before the operation, such as breathlessness, it's likely that these symptoms will continue after surgery. \n Tests before surgery \n Before surgery can take place, you'll need to have a number of tests to check your general state of health and your lung function. These may include: \n \n an\u00a0 electrocardiogram (ECG)  \u2013 electrodes are used to monitor the electrical activity of your heart \n spirometry\u00a0\u2013 you'll breathe into a machine called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can breathe in and out \n \n How it's performed \n Surgery is usually performed by making a cut (incision)\u00a0in your chest or side, and removing a section or all of the affected lung. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed if it's thought that the cancer may have spread to them. \n In some cases, an alternative to this approach, called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), may be suitable. VATS is a type of keyhole surgery, where small incisions are made in the chest. A small fibre-optic camera is inserted into one of the incisions, so the surgeon can see images of the inside of your chest\u00a0on a monitor. \n After the operation \n You'll probably be\u00a0able to go home 5 to 10 days after your operation. However, it can take many weeks to recover fully from a lung operation. \n After your operation, you'll be encouraged to start moving about as soon as possible. Even if you have to stay in bed, you'll need to keep doing regular leg movements to help your circulation and prevent blood clots from forming. A physiotherapist will show you breathing exercises to help prevent complications. \n When you go home, you'll need to exercise gently to build up your strength and fitness. Walking and swimming are good forms of exercise that are suitable for most people after treatment for lung cancer. Talk to your care team about which types of exercise are suitable for you. \n Complications \n As with all surgery, lung surgery carries a risk of complications. These are estimated to occur in one out in five cases. These complications can usually be treated using medication or additional surgery, which may mean you need to stay in hospital for longer. \n Complications of lung surgery can include: \n \n inflammation or infection of the lung ( pneumonia )\u00a0 \n excessive bleeding\u00a0 \n a blood clot in the leg ( deep vein thrombosis ), which could potentially travel up to the lung (pulmonary embolism) \n \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses pulses of radiation to destroy cancer cells. There are a number of ways it can be used to treat people with lung cancer. \n An intensive course of radiotherapy, known as radical radiotherapy, can be used to try to cure non-small-cell lung cancer if the person isn't healthy enough for surgery. For very small tumours, a special type of radiotherapy called stereotactic radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery. \n Radiotherapy can also be used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn't possible (this is known as palliative radiotherapy). \n A type of radiotherapy known as prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is also sometimes used during the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. PCI involves treating the whole brain with a low dose of radiation. It's used as a preventative measure because there's a risk that small-cell lung cancer will spread to your brain. \n The three main\u00a0ways that radiotherapy can be given are described below: \n \n Conventional external beam radiotherapy \u2013 a machine is used to direct beams of radiation at affected parts of your body.\u00a0 \n Stereotactic radiotherapy \u2013 a more accurate type of external beam radiotherapy where several high-energy beams are used to deliver a higher dose of radiation to the tumour, while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue as much as possible. \n Internal radiotherapy \u2013 a catheter (thin tube) is inserted into your lung. A small piece of radioactive material is placed inside the catheter and positioned against the site of the tumour before being removed after a few minutes. \n \n For lung cancer, external beam radiotherapy is used more often than internal radiotherapy, particularly if it's thought that a cure is possible. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be used to treat tumours that are very small, as it's more effective than standard radiotherapy alone in these circumstances. \n Internal radiotherapy only tends to be used as a palliative treatment when the cancer is blocking or partly blocking your airway. \n Courses of treatment \n A course of radiotherapy treatment can be planned in several different ways. \n Radical radiotherapy is usually given five days a week, with a break at weekends. Each session of radiotherapy lasts 10-15 minutes and the course usually lasts four to seven weeks. \n Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) is an alternative method of delivering radical radiotherapy. CHART is given three times a day for 12 days in a row. \n For stereotactic radiotherapy, fewer treatment sessions are needed because a higher dose of radiation is delivered with each treatment. People having conventional radical radiotherapy are likely to have around 20-32 treatment sessions, whereas stereotactic radiotherapy typically only requires anything from 3 to 10 sessions. \n Palliative radiotherapy usually only requires one to five sessions to control your symptoms.\u00a0 \n Side effects \n Side effects of radiotherapy to the chest\u00a0include: \n \n  chest pain \u00a0 \n fatigue\u00a0 \n persistent\u00a0 cough  that may bring up blood-stained phlegm (this is normal and nothing to worry about)\u00a0 \n  difficulties swallowing (dysphagia) \u00a0 \n redness and soreness of the skin, which looks and feels like sunburn\u00a0 \n hair loss\u00a0on your chest\u00a0 \n \n Side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has been completed. \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medication to treat cancer. There are several different ways that chemotherapy can be used to treat lung cancer. For example, it can be: \n \n given before surgery to shrink a tumour, which can increase the chance of successful surgery\u00a0(this is usually only done as part of a clinical trial) \n given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning\u00a0 \n used to relieve symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure isn't possible \n combined with radiotherapy \n \n Chemotherapy treatments are usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to let your body recover from the effects of the treatment. \n The number of cycles of chemotherapy you need will depend on the type and the grade of your lung cancer. Most people require four to six courses of treatment over three to six months. \n Chemotherapy for lung cancer involves taking a combination of different medications. The medications are usually delivered through a drip into a vein (intravenously), or into a tube connected to one of the blood vessels in your chest. Some people may be given capsules or tablets to swallow instead. \n Side effects \n Side effects of chemotherapy can include: \n \n fatigue\u00a0 \n nausea \n vomiting\u00a0 \n mouth ulcers \n hair loss \n \n These side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished, or you may be able to take other medicines to make you feel better during your chemotherapy. \n Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection.\u00a0Tell your care team or GP as soon as possible if you have possible signs of an infection, such as a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more, or you suddenly feel generally unwell. \n Other treatments \n As well as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there are a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to treat lung cancer. These are described below. \n Biological therapies \n Biological therapies\u00a0are newer medications. They're sometimes recommended as an alternative treatment to chemotherapy for non-small-cell cancer that has spread too far for surgery or radiotherapy to be effective. \n Examples of biological therapies include\u00a0erlotinib and gefitinib. These are also called\u00a0growth factor inhibitors because they work by disrupting the growth of the cancer cells. \n Biological therapies are only suitable for people who have\u00a0certain proteins\u00a0in their cancerous cells. Your doctor may be able to request tests on\u00a0a small\u00a0sample of cells removed from your lung (biopsy) to determine whether these treatments\u00a0are likely to be suitable for you. \n Radiofrequency ablation \n Radiofrequency ablation is a new type of treatment that can treat non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed at an early stage. \n The doctor carrying out the treatment uses a  computerised tomography (CT) scanner  to guide a needle to the site of the tumour. The needle will be pressed into the tumour and radio waves will be sent through the needle. These waves generate heat, which kills the cancer cells. \n The most common complication of radiofrequency ablation is that a pocket of air gets trapped between the inner and outer layer of your lungs (pneumothorax). This can be treated by placing a tube into the lungs to drain away the trapped air. \n Cryotherapy \n Cryotherapy is a treatment that can be used if the cancer starts to block your airways. This is known as endobronchial obstruction, and it can cause symptoms such as: \n \n breathing problems \n a cough \n coughing up blood \n \n Cryotherapy is performed in a similar way to internal radiotherapy, except that instead of using a radioactive source, a device known as a cryoprobe is placed against the tumour. The cryoprobe can generate very cold temperatures, which help to shrink the tumour. \n Photodynamic therapy \n Photodynamic therapy (PDT)\u00a0is a treatment that can be used to treat early-stage lung cancer when a person is unable or unwilling to have surgery. It can also be used to remove a tumour that's blocking the airways. \n Photodynamic therapy is carried out in two stages. Firstly, you'll be given an injection of a medication that makes the cells in your body very sensitive to light. \n The next stage is carried out 24-72 hours later. A thin tube\u00a0will be guided to the site of the tumour, and a laser will be beamed through it. The cancerous cells, which are now more sensitive to light, will be destroyed by the laser beam. \n Side effects of photodynamic therapy can include inflammation of the airways\u00a0and a build-up of fluid in the lungs. Both these side effects can cause symptoms of breathlessness and lung and throat pain. However, these symptoms should gradually pass as your lungs recover from the effects of the treatment.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you have  symptoms of lung cancer , such as breathlessness or a persistent cough. \n Your GP will ask about your general health and what symptoms you've been experiencing. They may examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out. \n You may be asked to have a\u00a0 blood test  to rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms, such as a  chest infection . \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published  guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of lung cancer  and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected lung cancer. \n Chest X-ray \n A chest  X-ray  is usually the first test used to diagnose lung cancer. Most lung tumours show up on X-rays as a white-grey mass. \n However, chest X-rays can't give a definitive diagnosis because they often can't distinguish between cancer and other conditions, such as a lung abscess (a collection of pus that forms in the lungs). \n If your chest X-ray suggests you may have lung cancer, you should be referred to a specialist (if you haven't already) in chest conditions such as lung cancer. A specialist can carry out more tests to investigate whether you have lung cancer and, if you do,\u00a0what type it is\u00a0and how much it's spread. \n CT scan \n A  computerised tomography (CT) scan  is usually carried out after a chest X-ray. A CT scan\u00a0uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of your body. \n Before having a CT scan, you'll be given an injection of a contrast medium. This is a liquid containing a dye that makes the lungs show up more clearly on the scan. The scan is painless and takes 10-30 minutes to complete. \n PET-CT scan \n A PET-CT scan (which stands for  positron emission tomography -computerised tomography) may be carried out if the results of the CT scan show you have cancer at an early stage. \n The PET-CT scan can show where there are active cancer cells. This can help with diagnosis and treatment. \n Before having a PET-CT scan, you'll be injected with a slightly radioactive material. You'll be asked to lie down on a table, which slides into the PET scanner. The scan is painless and takes around 30-60 minutes. \n Bronchoscopy and biopsy \n If the CT scan shows there might be cancer in the central part of your chest, you'll have a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a procedure\u00a0that allows\u00a0a doctor or nurse to\u00a0remove a small sample of cells from inside your lungs. \n During a bronchoscopy, a thin tube called a bronchoscope is used to examine your lungs and take a sample of cells ( biopsy ). The bronchoscope is passed through your mouth or nose, down your throat and into the airways of your lungs. \n The procedure may be uncomfortable, but you'll be given a mild sedative beforehand to help you relax and a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  to make your throat numb. The procedure is very quick and only takes a few minutes. \n Other types of biopsy \n If you're not able to have one of the biopsies described above, or you've had one and the results weren't clear, you may be offered a different type of biopsy. This may be a type of surgical biopsy such as a thoracoscopy or a mediastinoscopy, or a biopsy carried out using a needle inserted through your skin. \n These types of biopsy are described below. \n Percutaneous needle biopsy \n A percutaneous needle biopsy involves removing a sample from a suspected tumour to test it at a laboratory for cancerous cells. \n The doctor carrying out the biopsy will use a CT scanner to guide a needle to the site of a suspected tumour through the skin. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the surrounding skin, and the needle is passed through your skin and into your lungs. The needle will then be used to remove a sample of tissue for testing. \n Thoracoscopy \n A thoracoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to examine a particular area of your chest and take tissue and fluid samples. \n You're likely to need a\u00a0 general anaesthetic  before having a thoracoscopy. Two or three small cuts will be made in your chest to pass a tube (similar to a bronchoscope) into your chest. The doctor will use the tube to look inside your chest and take samples. The samples will then be sent away for tests. \n After a thoracoscopy, you may need to stay in hospital overnight while any further fluid in your lungs is drained out. \n Mediastinoscopy \n A mediastinoscopy allows the doctor to examine the area between your lungs at the centre of your chest (mediastinum). \n For this test, you'll need to have a general anaesthetic and stay in hospital for a couple of days. The doctor will make a small cut at the bottom of your neck so they can pass a thin tube into your chest. \n The tube has a camera at the end, which enables the doctor to see inside your chest. They'll also be able to take samples of your cells and lymph nodes at the same time. The lymph nodes are tested because they're usually the first place that lung cancer spreads to. \n Staging \n Once the above tests have been completed, it should be possible to work out what stage your cancer is, what this means\u00a0for your treatment and whether it's possible to\u00a0completely cure the cancer. \n Non-small-cell lung cancer \n Non-small-cell lung cancer (the most common type)\u00a0usually spreads more slowly than small-cell lung cancer and responds differently to treatment. \n The stages of non-small-cell lung cancer\u00a0are outlined below. \n Stage 1 \n The cancer is contained within the lung and hasn't spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage 1 can also be divided into two sub-stages: \n \n stage 1A \u2013 the tumour is less than 3cm in size (1.2 inches)\u00a0 \n stage 1B \u2013 the tumour is 3-5cm (1.2-2 inches) \n \n Stage 2 \n Stage 2 is divided into two sub-stages: 2A and 2B. \n In stage 2A lung cancer, either: \n \n the tumour is 5-7cm\u00a0 \n the tumour is less than 5cm\u00a0and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes \n \n In stage 2B lung cancer, either: \n \n the tumour is larger than 7cm\u00a0 \n the tumour is 5-7cm and cancerous cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes\u00a0 \n the cancer hasn't spread to lymph nodes, but has spread to surrounding\u00a0muscles or tissue\u00a0 \n the cancer has spread to one of the main airways (bronchus)\u00a0 \n the cancer has caused the lung to collapse\u00a0 \n there are multiple small tumours in the lung \n \n Stage 3 \n Stage 3 is divided into two sub-stages: 3A and 3B. \n In stage 3A lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or into the surrounding tissue. This can be: \n \n the covering of the lung (the pleura) \n the chest wall \n the middle of the chest \n other lymph nodes near the affected lung \n \n In stage 3B lung cancer, the cancer has spread to either of the following: \n \n lymph nodes on either side of the chest, above the collarbones \n another important part of the body, such as the gullet (oesophagus), windpipe (trachea), heart or into a main blood vessel \n \n Stage 4 \n In stage 4 lung cancer, the cancer has either spread to both lungs or to another part of the body (such as the bones, liver or brain), or the cancer has caused fluid-containing cancer cells to build up around your heart or lungs. \n Small-cell lung cancer \n Small-cell lung cancer is less common than non-small-cell lung cancer. The cancerous cells responsible for the condition are smaller in size when examined under a microscope than the cells that cause non-small-cell lung cancer. \n Small-cell lung cancer only\u00a0has two possible stages: \n \n limited disease \u2013 the cancer has not spread beyond the lung \n extensive disease \u2013 the cancer has spread beyond the lung \n \n Want to know more? \n \n  Cancer Research UK: Types of lung cancer  \n  Macmillan Cancer Support: Being diagnosed with lung cancer"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Loss of libido", "introduction": "Loss of libido (sex drive) is a common problem affecting up to one in five men \u2013 and even more women \u2013 at some point in their life. \n It's often linked to professional and personal stress, or\u00a0important life-changing events such as pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. \n However, an unexpected loss of libido\u00a0\u2013\u00a0especially when it lasts for a long time or keeps returning\u00a0\u2013\u00a0can also indicate an underlying personal, medical or lifestyle problem,\u00a0which can be upsetting to both partners in a relationship. \n If you're concerned about your libido, especially if your diminished sex drive distresses you or affects your relationship, make an appointment to see your GP to discuss any underlying causes and possible medical or psychological treatments. \n Doctors at your  nearest family planning clinic , Integrated Sexual Health clinic, or Contraceptive and Sexual Health (CASH) clinic may also be able to help. \n In the meantime, you may find the following information useful. It explains some of the most common reasons for loss of libido. \n Relationship problems \n The first thing you should consider is whether you're happy in your relationship. Do you have any doubts or worries that may be the real reason for your loss of sexual desire? \n If you've been in a relationship for a long time, you may have become overfamiliar with your partner and feel a degree of erotic dissatisfaction. This is quite common and can have a negative effect on your sex drive. \n Relationship problems are among the most common causes of loss of libido. For help and advice, you\u00a0may find it useful to contact the relationship support charity  Relationships Scotland . \n Another thing to consider is whether the problem is a performance issue that makes sex difficult or unfulfilling. For example, many men experience ejaculation problems or  erectile dysfunction , and women can experience painful sex or  vaginismus  (when the muscles around the vagina tighten involuntarily before penetration). See your GP if these problems are an issue, as they're often treatable. \n Your GP may feel you will benefit from psychosexual counselling. This is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your loss of libido.\u00a0 \n Stress, anxiety and exhaustion \n Stress, anxiety and exhaustion can be all-consuming and have a major impact on your happiness. If you feel you're constantly tired, stressed or anxious, you may need to make some lifestyle changes or speak to your GP for advice. \n For more information and advice read about\u00a0 beating stress at work \u00a0and\u00a0 10 stress busters  \n Depression \n  Depression \u00a0is very different from simply feeling unhappy, miserable or fed up for a short while. It's a serious illness where you may have feelings of extreme sadness that can last for a long time. These feelings are severe enough to interfere with your daily life, including your sex life. \n You're probably depressed if you're feeling low or hopeless, or you've lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy. In this case it's really important to see your GP. They may feel you'll benefit from  antidepressants . \n However, low sex drive can also be a side effect of many antidepressants. Speak to your GP if you're already taking antidepressants and think they may be causing your problems, as you may be able to switch to a different medication. \n Drugs and alcohol \n Drinking excess amounts of alcohol can reduce your sex drive, so it's a good idea to moderate your intake to no more than three to four units a day if you're a man, and no more than two to three units a day if you're a woman. \n Read more about  alcohol misuse  and find out how to get  support for a drinking problem . \n Drug misuse is also linked to a loss of sex drive. Read more about  drugs  for information and advice. \n Getting older \n Many people lose some interest in sex as they get older, mainly as a result of falling levels of sex hormones, age-related health problems, or the side effects of medication. \n Older men especially can develop low testosterone levels, which can cause fatigue, depression and a reduced sex drive. \n Speak to your GP if you're concerned about this. They may carry out a  blood test  to check your testosterone level and can tell you about treatments if your level is low. \n As women start to approach the  menopause , levels of the female hormone oestrogen begin to fall, which can affect libido. Women can also suffer from low testosterone levels, especially after a  hysterectomy . Testosterone is another hormone\u00a0that can affect sex drive. \n Speak to your GP if you're concerned the menopause may be having an effect on your libido. They may be able to offer you a trial of  hormone replacement therapy\u00a0(HRT)  if it's suitable for you. \n Hormonal problems \n Less commonly, low libido may be caused by an  underactive thyroid . This is where your thyroid gland (located in the neck) doesn't produce enough hormones. Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed. \n An underactive thyroid is easily treated by taking hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making. Learn more about  treating underactive thyroid . \n A hormonal problem called hyperprolactinaemia can also have a negative effect on your sex drive. This is where you have a raised level of a substance called prolactin in your blood. \n Contraception \n Some women have reported a decreased sex drive while using\u00a0some types of hormonal\u00a0contraception, such as: \n \n combined contraception, including the\u00a0 combined pill ,  vaginal ring ,\u00a0or  contraceptive patch  \n  the progestogen-only pill  \n  the contraceptive implant  \n  the Depo-Provera injection  \n \n However, side effects of these contraceptives\u00a0tend to\u00a0improve within a few months and they're generally well tolerated. \n Speak to your GP or\u00a0 local contraceptive (or family planning) clinic  if you're worried\u00a0your contraception\u00a0is causing a loss of libido. They may suggest trying an alternative method. \n Read more about  choosing a method of contraception  \n Other medical conditions \n Long-term (chronic) medical conditions such as  cardiovascular disease ,  diabetes  and  obesity  can also have a negative effect on your libido. \n Medication \n Certain medications can sometimes reduce libido, such as: \n \n  medication for high blood pressure , including diuretics \n medications for depression, including  SSRI antidepressants  \n medications for seizures (fits) \n medications commonly used to treat\u00a0 psychosis  (a mental condition where a person can't distinguish between reality and their imagination), such as haloperidol, as well as many other conditions \n medicines such as cimetidine, finasteride and cyproterone, which block the effects or reduce the production of testosterone \n \n See your GP if you're worried that medication you're taking is responsible for your reduced sex drive. They can review your medication and switch your prescription to something less likely to affect your libido if necessary.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Liver tumours", "introduction": "Approximately 10 children in the UK develop primary liver tumours each year. Boys are affected more commonly than girls. Liver tumours can be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). This factsheet is about malignant liver tumours. \n There are two main types of primary liver cancer: \n  Hepatoblastoma  \n This usually occurs in children under five years of age. About eight children in the UK are diagnosed with hepatoblastoma each year. \n  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  \n This is rarer and usually occurs in older children. About two children in the UK are diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma each year. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n  The liver  \n The liver is the largest organ in the body. It is surrounded by a fibrous capsule and is divided into sections called lobes. It lies across the upper part of the abdomen and is larger on the right hand side of the body than on the left. It\u2019s surrounded, and protected from injury, by the lower ribs. \n The liver is an extremely important organ that has many functions. One of these functions is to produce proteins that circulate in the blood. Some of the proteins help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Others are essential for maintaining the balance of fluid in the body. The liver also destroys harmful substances. It breaks down waste products not used by the body so that they can be passed out in the urine or stools (bowel motions). \n The liver is responsible for breaking down food containing carbohydrates (sugars) and fats, so they can be used by the body for energy. It stores substances such as glucose and vitamins so that they can be used by the body when needed. \n The liver also produces bile, a substance that breaks down the fats in food so that they can be absorbed from the bowel (intestine). \n The liver is connected to the small intestine (duodenum) by a tube called the bile duct. This duct takes the bile produced by the liver to the intestine. \n The liver has an amazing ability to repair itself. It can function normally even if only a small part of it is working. \n Causes \n The cause of most primary liver tumours in the western world is unknown. However, in other parts of the world, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is commonly related to the presence of liver infection. This happens in countries where mothers commonly have hepatitis B and vaccination is not readily available at birth for their children. \n Children who are infected with hepatitis B have a higher risk of developing HCC in late childhood than uninfected children. \n Signs and symptoms \n The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, which can be painful. Other possible symptoms include weight loss, a loss of appetite, feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting). \n How liver tumours are diagnosed \n A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a liver tumour. \n An  ultrasound scan  and  X-rays  will be taken, which can show if there is a tumour in the liver. Further tests, including  CT (computerised tomography) scans  or  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans , will be done to find out the extent of the disease, both inside and outside the liver.  Blood tests  will also be carried out. \n Most hepatoblastomas and hepatocellular carcinomas produce a protein that is released into the bloodstream. This protein is known as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). It\u2019s possible to measure levels of AFP in the blood, which can be a useful indicator of whether the liver tumour is responding to treatment or whether it may have come back after treatment. AFP is also known as a tumour marker. \n Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. \n Grouping \n To assess the extent of the cancer, a grouping system called PRETEXT (pre-treatment extent of disease) is used. It uses an MRI scan to measure the amount of cancer in the liver at diagnosis. It\u2019s also used to help establish the best treatment for each child. \n This grouping system is unique to liver tumours and is increasingly used all over the world. \n This grouping process is essential because liver tumours need to be removed surgically. Grouping divides the liver into four surgical areas (sectors) and gives an indication of the kind of surgery that is needed to remove the tumour. Grouping also helps doctors decide whether a liver transplant surgeon needs to be involved from the start or not. \n PRETEXT 1 \n One liver sector is affected and the tumour can be removed by straightforward surgery. \n PRETEXT 2 \n Two adjoining sectors are affected and the tumour can be removed with more extensive surgery. \n PRETEXT 3 \n Two or three sectors are affected with no two adjoining sectors free of disease, and the tumour can be removed with major surgery. \n PRETEXT 4 \n All four sectors of the liver are affected, and the tumour cannot be removed without replacing the liver with a donor liver transplant. \n Doctors also look at the extent of the spread of cancer beyond the liver: \n  In the blood vessels  \n Sometimes the tumour gets into the blood vessels that are entering or leaving the liver. This may affect the type of surgery needed to remove the tumour. \n  In the abdomen  \n Sometimes the tumour spreads outside the liver and into the abdomen (tummy). The tumour cannot be removed completely. \n  In the lungs or other organs  \n If the tumour spreads outside the liver through the bloodstream (metastatic disease), it usually goes to the lungs. About 1 in 5 children are found to have affected lungs when they are diagnosed. Doctors use X-rays and CT or MRI scans to assess whether the lungs are affected. \n Treatment \n The diagnosis is made by taking a sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). This is done under a general anaesthetic. Once the diagnosis and staging have been confirmed, plans for treatment will be made. \n  Hepatoblastoma  \n For hepatoblastoma the type of treatment will depend on the PRETEXT staging and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease). \n PRETEXT 1, 2 and 3 tumours are called \u2018standard risk\u2019. PRETEXT 4 is called \u2018high risk\u2019 and includes tumours that have spread to other parts of the body. \n Treatment is broadly similar for all PRETEXT stages. Chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs) is given first. The aim of chemotherapy is to shrink the tumour in the liver and hopefully get rid of any metastatic tumours. Surgery to remove any remaining tumour will take place after a few weeks of chemotherapy. Further chemotherapy is usually given after surgery. Your child\u2019s doctor will give you more detailed information about the chemotherapy drugs and their side effects. \n  Hepatocellular carcinoma  \n For hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment is a little different. \n The role of chemotherapy is less certain and surgery is the main treatment. Doctors usually recommend removing the tumour (if it\u2019s small enough) at diagnosis. Chemotherapy may be given afterwards. However, in many situations the tumour is too large to remove at first and so chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumour so that surgery can be done later. \n Hepatocellular tumours don\u2019t always respond to chemotherapy as well as hepatoblastomas. For this reason, other treatments, such as chemoembolisation and targeted treatments (see below), may be used. \n  Chemoembolisation  \n This refers to the giving of drugs directly into the artery going into the liver. Very occasionally, this may be used for hepatocellular cancer. \n  Targeted drugs  \n Targeted drugs are a group of treatments that work in a different way to conventional chemotherapy. Some drugs may cause cancer cells to die directly. Others act to cut off the blood supply to the tumour cells (antiangiogenesis drugs). Some drugs, called multi-targeted agents, work in both ways. \n Research is looking into how useful targeted treatments are on their own and in combination with chemotherapy. Your child\u2019s doctor may talk to you more about this research. \n  Surgery  \n All children, if they are able to, will have surgery following chemotherapy. If there\u2019s cancer in the lungs, which hasn\u2019t completely disappeared with the chemotherapy, the lungs will be operated on first. If the liver tumour can be surgically removed, the operation to do so will follow, usually a week or two later. \n If the tumour involves all four sectors of the liver (PRETEXT 4), a liver transplant will be necessary. This is recommended for hepatoblastoma but only in particular circumstances for hepatocellular carcinoma. In a transplant, the whole liver is removed and replaced with a liver from another person. \n This will be discussed with you from the beginning, and you will be given the opportunity to think about donating half of your liver, or for your child to have a liver from a donor. The transplant team will be there to answer all of your questions. A liver transplant is only possible if all the cancer outside the liver has gone. \n Side effects of treatment \n Treatment often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. Side effects can include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n  hair loss  \n an increased risk of infection \n bruising and bleeding \n  tiredness  \n  diarrhoea  \n \n Late side effects \n The chemotherapy used to treat liver cancer can cause late side effects. These may include hearing problems, kidney problems and possibly heart problems. There will be a slightly increased risk of your child developing another type of cancer later in life. Most children will develop some late effects and need to have some follow-up tests. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects. \n Recurrence \n If the cancer comes back after initial treatment, this is known as a recurrence. It can come back in the liver or in other parts of the body. If the cancer comes back, often (before anything is seen on scans) the levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the child\u2019s blood will start to rise again and reaches levels of over 100. Small rises in AFP can occur in the weeks after surgery, as the liver regenerates as much as it can. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancer. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n When the treatment ends, your child will have regular blood tests to measure the level of AFP in the blood (if appropriate), as well as scans and chest X-rays. More than three quarters of children with hepatoblastoma are cured, and for children with small tumours that are confined to the liver, the outlook is even better. The outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma is not quite as good. The staff at the hospital can give you information about the likely outcome for your child. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Liver cancer", "introduction": "Primary liver cancer is an uncommon but serious type of cancer that begins in the liver. \n This is a separate condition from secondary liver cancer, which occurs when cancer that first develops in another part of the body spreads to the liver. \n The rest of this article refers to primary liver cancer only. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about  secondary liver cancer . \n Signs and symptoms \n Symptoms of\u00a0liver cancer are often vague and don't appear until the cancer is at an advanced stage. They can\u00a0include: \n \n unexplained weight loss \n loss of appetite \n feeling very full after eating, even if the meal was small \n feeling sick and vomiting \n pain or swelling\u00a0in your abdomen (tummy) \n jaundice (yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes) \n itchy skin \n feeling very tired and weak \n \n Visit your GP if you notice any of the symptoms listed above. Although they are more likely to be the result of a more common condition, such as an infection, it's best to have them checked. \n You should also contact your GP if you have previously been diagnosed with a condition known to affect the liver, such as  cirrhosis  or a  hepatitis C  infection, and your health suddenly deteriorates. \n What causes\u00a0liver cancer? \n The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but most cases are associated with damage and scarring of the liver known as cirrhosis. \n Cirrhosis can have a number of different causes, including drinking\u00a0excessive amounts of alcohol over\u00a0many years and having a long-term  hepatitis B \u00a0or\u00a0 hepatitis C \u00a0viral infection. \n It is also believed obesity and an unhealthy diet\u00a0can increase the risk of liver cancer because this can lead to  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . \n By avoiding or cutting down on alcohol,\u00a0 eating healthily  and\u00a0 exercising regularly , and taking steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B and C, you may be able to significantly reduce your chances of developing liver cancer. \n Read more about the  causes of liver cancer . \n Who is affected? \n Despite being a common type of cancer worldwide, liver cancer is relatively uncommon in the UK, with just over 4,000 new cases diagnosed each year. However, the chances of developing the condition are high for people with risk factors for the condition. \n The number of people affected by liver cancer rises sharply with age, with around 8 in every 10 cases diagnosed in people aged 60 or older, although it also affects many people younger than this. Around two in every three cases affect men. \n Over the past few decades, rates of liver cancer in the UK have risen considerably, possibly as a result of increased levels of alcohol intake and obesity.\u00a0 \n Diagnosis and screening \n Liver cancer is usually diagnosed after a consultation with a GP and a referral to a hospital specialist for further tests, such as scans of your liver. \n However, regular check-ups for liver cancer (known as surveillance) are often recommended for people known to have a high risk of developing the condition, such as those with cirrhosis. \n Having regular check-ups helps ensure the condition is diagnosed early. The earlier\u00a0liver cancer is diagnosed, the more effective\u00a0treatment is likely to be. \n Read\u00a0more about  diagnosing liver cancer . \n How liver cancer is treated \n Treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage the condition is at. If diagnosed\u00a0early, it may be possible to remove the cancer completely. \n Treatment options in the early stages of liver cancer include: \n \n surgical resection \u2013 surgery to remove a section of liver \n  liver transplant \u00a0\u2013 where the liver is replaced with a donor liver \n microwave or radiofrequency ablation \u2013 where microwaves or radio waves are used to destroy the cancerous cells \n \n However, only a small proportion of liver cancers are diagnosed at a stage where these treatments are suitable. Most people are diagnosed when the cancer has spread too far to be removed or completely destroyed. \n In these cases, treatments such as  chemotherapy  will be used to\u00a0slow down\u00a0the spread of the cancer and relieve symptoms such as pain and discomfort. \n Liver cancer prognosis \n Because liver cancer is most often detected at an advanced stage, only\u00a0around one in every five people live for at least a year after being diagnosed, and just\u00a01 in every 20 people live\u00a0at least a further\u00a0five years. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating liver cancer .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "The exact cause of liver cancer is unknown, but many cases are linked to a problem with the liver called  cirrhosis . This is where the tissue of the liver has become scarred and cannot perform many of its usual functions. \n Cancer is a condition\u00a0where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue known as a tumour. \n In cases of liver cancer, it is uncertain why and how the cells of the liver are affected, but it appears that cirrhosis can increase a person's chances of developing the condition. \n However, most cases of cirrhosis do not lead to liver cancer, and people without cirrhosis can\u00a0also develop liver cancer. \n Common causes of cirrhosis \n The main causes of cirrhosis in the UK are outlined below. \n Heavy and harmful drinking \n The liver is a tough and resilient organ. It can endure a high level of damage that would destroy other organs and is capable of regenerating itself. But despite the liver's resilience, excessive alcohol intake over many years can damage it. \n Every time you drink alcohol, your liver filters out the poisonous alcohol from your blood and some of the liver cells die. The liver can regenerate new cells, but if you drink heavily for many years, your liver will lose the ability to do this and it can become damaged and scarred over time. \n Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \n  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \u00a0occurs when small deposits of fat build up inside the tissue of the liver.\u00a0It's a\u00a0common condition and causes no noticeable symptoms in most people. \n However, in some people high levels of fat can make the liver inflamed. Over time, the inflammation\u00a0can scar the liver. \n The exact cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear, but it is associated with  obesity  and  type 2 diabetes . \n Hepatitis C \n A long-term infection of  hepatitis C \u00a0can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver.\u00a0 \n Hepatitis C is spread by blood contact. The most\u00a0common ways this happens worldwide\u00a0include poor medical practice with the use of contaminated needles, or injected drug use, where any item of injecting equipment (not just needles) is shared. \n If you smoke or regularly drink alcohol and have hepatitis C, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases. \n Early treatment of long-term hepatitis C with antiviral medication can prevent the liver becoming scarred. \n Other\u00a0causes of cirrhosis \n Less common causes of cirrhosis in the UK are described below. \n Hepatitis B \n  Hepatitis B \u00a0is a virus that can be spread through contaminated blood and other types of bodily fluids, such as saliva, semen and vaginal fluids. \n Like hepatitis C, hepatitis B is spread through blood contact. It is most commonly spread from mother to child at birth or from child to child in early life (usually in areas outside the UK where the infection is very common), and very rarely sexually or through injecting drugs. \n It affects about\u00a01 in every 200 people\u00a0in the UK. Most of those infected were born in\u00a0parts of the world where the hepatitis B\u00a0virus is very common. \n As with hepatitis C, hepatitis B can also cause inflammation and scarring of the liver over time. \n If you smoke or drink and have hepatitis B, your risk of developing liver cancer further increases. \n Early treatment of long-term hepatitis B with antiviral medication is not always needed, but can substantially reduce the risk of the liver becoming scarred. \n Haemochromatosis \n Haemochromatosis\u00a0is a genetic condition where the body stores too much iron from food. \n The excess levels of iron have a poisonous effect on the liver and cause scarring over time, although treatment can reduce the risk of the condition leading to liver cancer. \n Primary biliary cirrhosis \n Primary biliary cirrhosis\u00a0is a rare and poorly understood liver condition. \n One of the main functions of the liver is to create a\u00a0fluid called bile, used by the body to help break down fat. The bile is transported to the digestive system via a series of tubes called bile ducts. \n For reasons that are unclear, in cases of primary biliary cirrhosis the bile ducts gradually become\u00a0damaged. This eventually leads to a build-up of bile inside the liver, which damages the liver and causes cirrhosis.", "treatment": "The treatment for liver cancer depends on the stage of the condition. Treatment can include surgery and medication. \n Cancer treatment teams \n Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) to treat liver cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. \n Deciding which treatment is best for you can often be confusing. Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. \n Your treatment plan \n Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage your liver cancer is at (see  diagnosing liver cancer  for more information about staging). \n If your cancer is at stage A when diagnosed, a complete cure may be possible. The three main ways this can be achieved are: \n \n removing the affected section of liver \u2013 known as a resection \n having a liver transplant \u2013 an operation to remove the liver and replace it with a healthy one \n using heat to kill cancerous cells \u2013 known as microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) \n \n If your cancer is at stage B or C, a cure is not usually possible. However, chemotherapy can slow the progression of the cancer, relieve symptoms, and prolong life for months or, in some cases, years. There is also a medication called sorafenib that\u00a0can help prolong life. \n If your cancer is at stage D when diagnosed, it is usually too late to slow down the spread of the cancer. Instead, treatment focuses on relieving\u00a0any\u00a0symptoms of pain and discomfort you may have. \n The main treatment options for liver cancer are discussed in more detail below. \n Surgical resection \n If damage to your liver is minimal and the cancer is contained in a small part of your liver, it may be possible to remove the cancerous cells during surgery. This procedure is known as surgical resection. \n As the liver can regenerate itself, it may be possible to remove a large section of it without seriously affecting your health. However, in the majority of people with liver cancer, their liver's regenerative ability may be significantly impaired and resection may be unsafe. \n Whether or not a resection can be performed is often determined by assessing the severity of your  cirrhosis  (scarring of the liver). \n If a liver resection is recommended, it will be carried out under a  general anaesthetic , which means you will be asleep during the procedure and won't feel any pain as it is carried out. \n Most people are well enough to leave hospital within a week or two of having surgery. However, depending on how much of your liver was removed, it may take several months for you to fully recover. \n Risks \n Liver resection is a complicated surgery and can have a considerable impact on your body. There is a significant risk of complications occurring during and after surgery. \n Possible complications of liver resection include: \n \n infection at the site of the surgery \n bleeding after the surgery \n blood clots that develop in your legs \u2013 the medical term for this is  deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  \n bile leaking from the liver \u2013 further surgery may be required to stop the leak \n jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) \n liver failure (where your liver is no longer able to function properly) \n \n Liver resection can also sometimes cause fatal complications, such as a heart attack. It is estimated that around\u00a01 in every 30 people who have liver resection surgery will die during or shortly after the operation. \n Liver transplant \n A liver transplant involves removing a cancerous liver and replacing it with a healthy one from a donor. \n This is a major operation and there is a risk of potentially life-threatening complications. It's estimated around 1 in every 30 people will die during the procedure and up to\u00a01 in 10 people will die at some point in the year after surgery. \n A liver transplant may be suitable for you if: \n \n you only have a single tumour less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter \n you have three or fewer small tumours, each less than 3cm (30mm) \n you have responded exceptionally well to other treatments, with no evidence of tumour growth for six months \n \n If you have multiple tumours or a tumour larger than 5cm, the risk of the cancer returning is usually so high that a liver transplant will be of no benefit. \n If you are suitable for a liver transplant, you will normally need to be placed on a waiting list until a donor liver becomes available. The average waiting time for a liver transplant is 142 days for adults. \n In some cases, a small part of the liver of a living relative can be used. This is known as a living donor liver transplant. \n The advantage of using a living donor liver transplant is that the person receiving the transplant can plan the procedure with their medical team and relative, and will not usually have to wait very long. \n Read more about  liver transplants . \n Microwave or radiofrequency ablation \n Microwave or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) may be recommended as an alternative to surgery to treat liver cancer at an early stage, ideally when the tumour or tumours are smaller than 5cm (50mm) in diameter. \n They can also be used to treat tumours larger than this, but the treatment may need to be repeated in such cases. \n These treatments involve heating the tumours with microwaves or radio waves produced by small, needle-like electrodes. This heat kills the cancer cells and causes the tumours to shrink. \n Similar procedures using lasers or freezing can also achieve the same result. \n There are three main ways microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out: \n \n where the needles are passed through the skin (percutaneously) \n where the needles are inserted through small incisions in your abdomen\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\"keyhole\" surgery (laparoscopy) \n where the needles are inserted through a single large incision made in your abdomen\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\"open\" surgery \n \n Continuous  ultrasound  or  computerised tomography (CT) scans  are used to make sure the needles are guided into the correct position. \n Microwave ablation or RFA can be carried out under general anaesthetic or\u00a0 local anaesthetic  (where you are awake but the area being treated is numbed), depending on the technique used and the size of the area being treated. \n How long it takes to carry out the treatment depends on the size and number of tumours being treated, but it usually takes between one and three hours in total. Most people need to stay overnight in hospital. \n You may experience some minor discomfort and\u00a0 flu -like symptoms, such as chills and muscle pains, for a few days after the procedure. \n The risk of complications occurring with microwave ablation or RFA is low, but possible problems can include bleeding, infection, minor burns and damage to nearby organs. \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy\u00a0uses powerful cancer-killing medications to slow the spread of liver cancer. \n A type of chemotherapy called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is usually recommended to treat cases of stage B and C liver cancer. In these cases, the treatment can prolong life, but cannot cure the cancer. \n TACE may also be used to help prevent cancer spreading out of the liver in people waiting for a liver transplant. \n It\u00a0is not recommended for stage D liver cancer because it can make the symptoms of liver disease worse. \n TACE procedure \n During TACE a fine tube called a catheter is inserted\u00a0into the main blood vessel in your groin (femoral artery) and passed along the artery\u00a0to the main blood vessel that carries blood to the liver (hepatic artery). \n Chemotherapy medication is injected directly into the liver through the catheter and either a gel or small plastic beads are injected into the blood vessels supplying the tumours to help slow down the speed they grow at. \n TACE usually takes one to two hours to complete. After the procedure, you will stay in hospital overnight before returning home. \n This procedure can be completed several times if necessary. \n Side effects \n Injecting chemotherapy medications directly into the liver, rather than into the blood, has the advantage of avoiding the wide range of side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, such as hair loss and tiredness. \n However, the procedure is not free of side effects and complications. The most common side effect is post-chemoembolisation syndrome, which can cause abdominal (tummy) pain and a high temperature (fever), as well as making you vomit or feel sick. \n These symptoms may last for a few weeks after a TACE session. \n Read more about  chemotherapy . \n Alcohol injections \n If you only have a few small tumours, alcohol (ethanol) injections may be used as a treatment.\u00a0A needle passes through the skin to inject alcohol into the cancerous cells. This dehydrates the cells and stops their blood supply. \n In most cases, this is carried out under a local anaesthetic, meaning you will be awake, but the affected area is numbed so you won't feel any pain. \n Sorafenib \n Sorafenib is a medication given in tablet form that can disrupt the blood supply to liver tumours and slow down their growth. \n It is sometimes used as a treatment for advanced cases of liver cancer, although it is not routinely available on the NHS because the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has said the cost of the medication is high for the limited benefit it offers. \n Whether or not you are eligible for sorafenib will be decided by your medical team, and will depend on the likelihood of whether\u00a0you will significantly benefit from the medication. \n For more information, see the  NICE guidelines on sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma . \n Advanced liver cancer \n Treatment for advanced liver cancer focuses on relieving symptoms such as pain and discomfort, rather than attempting to slow down the progression of the cancer. \n Some people with advanced liver cancer require strong painkillers, such as codeine or possibly morphine. Nausea and constipation are common side effects of these types of painkillers, so you may also be given an anti-sickness tablet and a laxative. \n Read more about  end of life care .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "For many people, the first stage of diagnosing liver cancer is a consultation with a GP, although people at risk are usually tested regularly for the condition. \n If you visit your GP, they will ask about your symptoms,\u00a0when they started, and when they are noticeable. They will also examine you. \n If they feel\u00a0you need further tests, they will refer you to a hospital specialist. Some of the tests you may have are described below. \n Surveillance for liver cancer \n If you are in a high-risk group for developing liver cancer, regular screening\u00a0\u2013 known as surveillance\u00a0\u2013 is often recommended. This is because the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the greater the chance there is of curing it. \n Surveillance is usually carried out every six months and\u00a0often involves: \n \n  ultrasound scans \u00a0\u2013 high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of your liver, which can highlight any abnormalities \n  blood tests \u00a0\u2013\u00a0your blood is tested for a protein called\u00a0alphafetoprotein (AFP), which is\u00a0found in some people with liver cancer \n \n Surveillance is usually recommended if you have  cirrhosis  (scarring of the liver), although there are other factors that can also affect your risk of liver\u00a0cancer. \n The potential benefits of surveillance should\u00a0be discussed with you before\u00a0you enter\u00a0any screening programme. \n Further testing \n The tests above can also be used to look for liver cancer in people who are not being routinely screened. \n If these initial\u00a0tests suggest there is a chance you could have liver cancer, one or more further tests will usually be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. \n The further tests include: \n \n  computerised tomography (CT) scans  \u2013\u00a0a series of X-rays of your liver are\u00a0taken to give\u00a0a more detailed three-dimensional image \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans \u00a0\u2013 uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to build up a picture of the inside of your liver \n  biopsy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a needle is inserted into your abdomen (tummy)\u00a0to remove a small sample of liver tissue, which is then tested in a laboratory for cancerous cells \n laparoscopy\u00a0\u2013 a small incision is made in your abdomen under  general anaesthetic  (where you are asleep) and a flexible camera called an endoscope is used to examine your liver \n \n After\u00a0these tests have been carried out, it will usually be possible to confirm a diagnosis of liver cancer and determine the condition's \"stage\". \n Staging liver cancer \n Staging is a term used to describe how far a particular cancer has spread. There are a number of different systems used to stage liver cancer. \n Many liver cancer specialists use combination staging systems that include features of both the cancer and the underlying liver function to stage a person's condition. \n This is because the length of time a person lives and how well they\u00a0tolerate potential treatments will be determined not only by how advanced their cancer is, but also by their level of health and how good their underlying liver function is. \n One combination system for staging liver cancer is known as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The BCLC staging system consists of five stages. These are: \n \n stage 0 \u2013\u00a0the tumour is less than 2cm (20mm) in diameter and the person is very well and has normal liver function \n stage A \u2013\u00a0a single tumour has grown but is less than 5cm (50mm) in diameter, or there are three or fewer smaller tumours\u00a0less than 3cm (30mm) in diameter and the person is very well with normal liver function \n stage B \u2013 there are multiple tumours in the liver, but the person is well and their liver function is unaffected \n stage C \u2013\u00a0any of the above circumstances, but the person is not so well and their liver function is not so good, or where the cancer has started to spread into the main blood vessel of the liver, nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body \n stage D \u2013\u00a0where the liver has lost most of its functioning abilities and the person begins to have symptoms of end-stage liver disease, such as a build-up of fluid inside their abdomen"},

However, the condition isn't infectious and doesn't usually run in families. It can't be passed on to other people, including sexual partners. \n Read more about the  causes of lichen planus . \n A\u00a0GP can usually\u00a0diagnose lichen planus by examining the rash and asking about your symptoms. Oral lichen planus is often diagnosed by a dentist during routine dental check-ups. \n Read more about  diagnosing lichen planus . \n Who's affected by lichen planus \n Lichen planus is thought to affect 1-2% of the worldwide population.

The mouth is affected in around 50% of all cases of lichen planus (oral lichen planus). \n Treating lichen planus \n There's no single treatment that can cure lichen planus completely. However, treatments are available\u00a0to help manage the symptoms and make living with it easier. For example,\u00a0 steroid creams  or ointments are often used to help relieve the itch and control the rash. \n Most cases of lichen planus of the skin clear up on their own within 6\u00a0to 9\u00a0months.

The papules usually measure 3-5mm in diameter and may also have irregular white streaks (Wickham's striae) \n thicker scaly patches can appear, usually around the ankles \u2013 this is known as hypertrophic lichen planus \n itchy skin \n \n Lichen planus of the skin often affects the wrists, ankles and lower back, although other parts of the body can also be affected. \n Thickened (hypertrophic) lichen planus affects the shins, and ring-shaped lichen planus affects creases in the skin, such as the armpits. \n After the\u00a0papules have cleared, the affected area of skin can sometimes become discoloured. \n Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) \n The symptoms of oral lichen planus are: \n \n a white pattern on the tongue and inner cheeks \n red and white patches in the mouth \n burning and discomfort in the mouth while eating or drinking \n painful red gums \n \n Mild cases of oral lichen planus don't usually cause any pain or discomfort. \n Lichen planus of the penis \n The symptoms of lichen planus of the penis are: \n \n purple or white ring-shaped patches on the tip of the penis (glans) \n bumps (papules) that are flat-topped and shiny \n a non-itchy rash \n \n Lichen planus of the vulva and vagina \n The symptoms of lichen planus of the vulva and vagina include: \n \n soreness, burning and rawness around the vulva \n the vulva may be covered in white streaks and be a red, pink or pale white colour \n if the vagina is affected, sexual intercourse can be painful \n if the outer layers of skin break down, moist, red patches can form \n scar tissue can form, which distorts the shape of the vagina \n a sticky yellow or green discharge,\u00a0which may be bloodstained \n the opening of the vagina can become narrowed \n \n Other areas \n Lichen planus can sometimes affect other areas, including: \n \n the nails \u2013 which can become thinner, ridged and grooved, or they may become darker, thicker or raised; they may sometimes shed or stop growing \n the scalp \u2013 red patches can appear around clusters of hair; in some cases, permanent\u00a0hair loss can occur", "causes": "The cause of lichen planus is unknown. \n It's thought\u00a0to be related to the immune system, or an abnormal response of the immune system to certain medicines. \n Lichen planus isn't infectious, doesn't usually run in families and can't be passed on to others. \n Autoimmune reaction \n The immune system protects your body against illness and infection\u00a0by producing antibodies (proteins)\u00a0that attack bacteria and viruses. \n In people with lichen planus, it's thought that the immune system becomes overactive, causing an excess amount of proteins to be produced, which inflame the skin. This is known as an autoimmune reaction and causes the  symptoms of lichen planus . \n Reaction to medication \n A reaction to certain medications is another possible cause of lichen planus. For example: \n \n gold injections \u2013 these are disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that are sometimes injected into the muscles of people with\u00a0 arthritis  to help reduce inflammation and painful joints \n antimalarial tablets \u2013 these help treat and prevent\u00a0 malaria  (a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes)", "treatment": "There's no cure for lichen planus, so treatments aim to ease the symptoms and clear the rash. Mild lichen planus doesn't require treatment. \n Self-help \n Below is some general self-help advice that can help ease your symptoms and prevent them getting worse. \n Lichen planus of the skin \n \n avoid washing with soap or bubble bath \u2013 use plain warm water instead \n wash your hair over a basin to stop affected areas of skin coming into contact with shampoo \n use an\u00a0emollient to moisturise your skin\u00a0 \n \n Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) \n \n avoid eating spicy foods and anything acidic, such as fruit juice, because they can irritate oral lichen planus \n avoid eating sharp food, such as crusty bread \n avoid drinking alcohol,\u00a0particularly spirits \n if areas of your mouth are painful, stick to soft, bland foods, such as mashed potatoes and porridge \n if possible, continue to use your usual toothpaste \n avoid using mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they may be too strong, and keep your mouth as clean as possible \n visit your dentist regularly to help keep your teeth and gums healthy \n \n Lichen planus of the genitals \n \n avoid washing with soap or bubble bath \u2013 use plain warm water or a soap substitute instead, such as aqueous cream \n use an emollient, such as petroleum jelly, before and after urinating \n applying ice packs to the affected areas may soothe itching\u00a0and swelling (never apply an ice pack directly to your skin \u2013 wrap\u00a0it in a clean tea towel before placing\u00a0it on your body) \n women should avoid wearing tights \n \n Lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails \n There are a number of\u00a0medications\u00a0and treatments that may be recommended for lichen planus of the skin, hair and nails. These are outlined below. \u00a0 \n Corticosteroid creams and ointments \n Corticosteroid creams and ointments\u00a0contain corticosteroids (artificial hormones) and are used to treat inflammatory skin conditions. They are often\u00a0referred to\u00a0as  topical corticosteroids . \n Topical corticosteroids help treat the\u00a0swelling (inflammation) and redness caused by lichen planus. Strong topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are also effective in reducing any itchiness you may have. \n Treatment is applied to the red or purple itchy spots, but should be stopped when the colour of the rash changes to brown or grey. This pigment change occurs when the inflammation has settled. Continuing to apply the corticosteroid cream to the brown areas of skin will\u00a0gradually cause the skin to thin. The side effects of corticosteroids can vary, depending on the: \n \n type and severity of treatment being used \n how long the treatment is used for \n nature of the condition being treated \n \n Potential side effects of topical corticosteroids can include: \n \n redness or burning and stinging of the skin \n skin rash \n thinning of the skin (atrophy) \n stretch marks (striae)\u00a0 \n contact dermatitis \u2013 a condition that causes skin inflammation \n excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) \n lightening of the skin \n \n Always check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. \n Corticosteroid tablets \n  Corticosteroid tablets \u00a0are sometimes used to treat severe cases of lichen planus, when the symptoms aren't being effectively controlled with creams or ointments. \n Possible side effects of corticosteroid tablets used on a short-term basis can include: \n \n increased appetite \n weight gain \n  insomnia  \n fluid retention (inability to pass urine) \n mood changes, such as feeling irritable or anxious \n \n Read more\u00a0about\u00a0the  side effects of corticosteroids . \n Other treatments \n Other treatments\u00a0recommended for lichen planus of the skin are outlined below.\u00a0 \n \n Antihistamines \u2013 these are often used to treat symptoms of  allergies , such as itchy skin. If you have lichen planus of the skin that's causing itchiness, antihistamines may be prescribed to help reduce this. \n Light treatment \u2013 there are 2\u00a0types of light treatment: ultraviolet B (UVB) and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). UVB is the most commonly used light treatment, but PUVA may be recommended in severe or widespread cases of lichen planus that don't respond to other types of treatment.\u00a0 \n Acitretin \u2013 this medication is only prescribed by a specialist and is used to treat severe cases of lichen planus. The tablets have some associated side effects and may not mix well with other medicines. Your specialist can offer advice. \n \n Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) \n Mild cases of oral lichen planus won't need any treatment. In more severe cases, treatment includes: \n \n a mouthwash that contains an anaesthetic to temporarily numb the mouth, which makes eating easier \n corticosteroid sprays, mouthwashes, pastes and dissolvable lozenges \n a mouthwash or gel that contains an antiseptic to help prevent the build-up of plaque in your mouth \n \n In more severe cases of oral lichen planus, corticosteroid tablets may also be used on a short-term basis. \n It can be difficult to prevent oral lichen planus, but to keep the lining of your mouth healthy it's recommended that you: \n \n  stop\u00a0smoking \u00a0(if you smoke) \n avoid drinking large amounts of  alcohol  \n have a  healthy, balanced diet , including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables \n \n You should also maintain\u00a0 good oral hygiene  by cleaning your teeth at least\u00a0twice a day, and having regular\u00a0 dental check-ups ,\u00a0so that any problems with your teeth or mouth\u00a0can be identified and treated early. \n Other treatments \n If corticosteroids are not effective in treating your symptoms, you may be prescribed a medication that suppresses your immune system to try to limit the autoimmune reaction that's thought to cause lichen planus. \n These types of treatments are known as immunomodulating agents. Depending on which area of your body is affected by lichen planus, treatments that may be recommended for you can include: treatments such as tacrolimus\u00a0 \n \n topical immunomodulating agents\u00a0(used to treat lichen planus of the skin) \u2013 treatments such as tacrolimus\u00a0ointment and\u00a0pimecrolimus cream are rubbed directly onto the skin \n immunomodulating agents\u00a0(used to treat lichen planus of the mouth) \u2013 these are usually available in the form of tablets or capsules, and can be used to treat severe cases of oral lichen planus \n \n These treatments can cause\u00a0a number of different side effects, which your specialist can discuss with you. \n You'll also need to have regular  blood tests  while taking immunomodulating agents, particularly in\u00a0the early stages of treatment.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Lichen planus is often diagnosed by a GP or dentist examining the affected area. \n Lichen planus of the skin \n Your GP may be able to make a diagnosis based on the characteristic rash.\u00a0However, lichen planus can be mistaken for other skin conditions, such as  eczema ,\u00a0which also causes the skin to become red, flaky and itchy. \n If your doctor\u00a0is unable to make a confident diagnosis by examining your skin, they may want to take a small skin sample ( biopsy ), which will be examined under a microscope. \n If a skin biopsy is required, you'll be given a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  to numb the affected area so you don't feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. \n Lichen planus of the mouth (oral lichen planus) \n A dentist or doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by looking at the inside of your mouth. \n A biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. A sample\u00a0of\u00a0mouth tissue will be removed so that it can be examined under a microscope.\u00a0As with lichen planus of the skin, you'll be given a local anaesthetic to numb the pain."},

This test allows\u00a0your doctor to assess any damage to your larynx. \n Laryngoscopies carried out through\u00a0the nose are not painful, but it can be uncomfortable and\u00a0the tube may trigger your gag reflex, which can make you feel like you want to be sick (it's highly unlikely that you actually will be sick).  Local anaesthetic  can be used to numb your nose and throat, which should help reduce these feelings. \n If you're having persistent problems with your voice, you might be asked to talk or sing while your larynx is examined. This may help your doctor determine why you're having problems with your voice. \n For laryngoscopies carried out through\u00a0the mouth,  general anaesthetic \u00a0is used. This means you'll be asleep during the examination.

It's estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year in the UK. \n They can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman's urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys. \n Younger women are most at risk because they tend to be more sexually active, and having frequent sex increases the chances of getting a kidney infection. \n Younger children are also vulnerable to developing kidney infections because they may be born with an abnormality of the urinary tract or have a condition called vesico-ureteric reflux, where there is a backflow of urine from the bladder up to the kidneys. \n Can kidney infections be prevented? \n You can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation. \n Read more about  preventing a\u00a0kidney infection", "symptoms": "The symptoms of a kidney infection usually develop quite quickly over a few hours or days. \n Common symptoms\u00a0include: \n \n pain and discomfort in your side, lower back\u00a0or around your genitals \n high temperature (it may reach 39.5C or 103.1F) \n shivering or chills \n feeling very weak or tired \n loss of appetite \n feeling sick or being sick\u00a0 \n  diarrhoea  \n \n You may have other symptoms\u00a0if you also have  cystitis  or urethritis\u00a0(an infection of the urethra).

The bacteria are usually a type called E. coli, which live in your bowel. \n The bacteria\u00a0get in\u00a0through the opening of the urethra\u00a0and move upwards through your urinary tract, first infecting your bladder and then your kidneys. \n It's thought the bacteria can get into your urinary tract by\u00a0accidentally spreading from your anus to your urethra. This can happen if you wipe your bottom after going to the toilet and the soiled toilet paper comes into contact with your genitals. It can also happen during sex. \n In rare cases, a kidney infection can develop if bacteria or fungi infect the skin and the infection spreads through your bloodstream into your kidney. However, this type of infection usually only occurs in people with weakened immune systems. \n Who's most likely to get a kidney infection? \n Women and children are most at risk of developing a kidney infection, as well as other urinary tract infections (UTIs) such as  cystitis . \n In women, the urethra is closer to the anus than in men, making it easier for bacteria from the anus to\u00a0enter the urethra accidentally. The female urethra is also much shorter than the male urethra (which runs through the penis). This makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder and move into the kidneys. \n Other\u00a0factors can also put you more at risk of developing a kidney infection, including: \n \n having a condition that blocks, or obstructs, your urinary tract, such as  kidney stones \u00a0or an  enlarged prostate \u00a0\u2013 children with  constipation  can also be at an increased risk \n being born with an abnormality in your urinary tract \n having a condition that prevents you emptying your bladder fully, such as an injury to your spinal cord\u00a0\u2013 this can allow bacteria in your bladder to multiply and spread \n having a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, due to  type 2 diabetes  or as a side effect of  chemotherapy  \n having an infection of the prostate gland called prostatitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the infection can spread from the prostate gland into the kidneys\u00a0 \n having a\u00a0urinary catheter (a thin, flexible tube inserted into your bladder to drain away urine) \n being female and sexually active\u00a0\u2013 sexual intercourse can irritate the urethra and allow bacteria to travel into your bladder \n being a man who has anal sex\u00a0\u2013 bacteria can travel up the urethra into the bladder \n being pregnant\u00a0\u2013 this can cause physical changes that slow the flow of urine out of your body and make it easier for bacteria to spread to the kidneys \n having undergone\u00a0female genital mutilation (FGM)\u00a0\u2013 an illegal practice where a\u00a0woman's genitals\u00a0are deliberately cut or changed for cultural, religious and social reasons", "treatment": "Most people with a kidney infection can be treated at home with a course of antibiotics, and possibly painkillers as well. \n See your GP if you have a fever and persistent tummy, lower back or genital pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. \n All children with symptoms of a\u00a0 urinary tract infection (UTI) \u00a0or kidney infection, including  cystitis , should see their GP or out-of-hours emergency service. \n Medication \n Antibiotics \n If you're being treated at home, you'll usually be prescribed a course of antibiotic tablets or capsules that lasts between seven and 14 days. \n For most people\u00a0\u2013\u00a0apart from pregnant women\u00a0\u2013 antibiotics called ciprofloxacin\u00a0or\u00a0Co-amoxiclav\u00a0are recommended. However, other antibiotics may also be used. \n Common side effects of ciprofloxacin include feeling sick and  diarrhoea . \n Co-amoxiclav\u00a0can make the\u00a0 contraceptive pill  and\u00a0 contraceptive patches  less effective, so you may need to use another form of contraception during the course of treatment. \n A 14-day course of an antibiotic called cefalexin is recommended for pregnant women. \n Usually, you'll start to feel better\u00a0quite soon after\u00a0treatment starts and you should feel completely better after about\u00a0two weeks. \n If your symptoms show no sign of improvement\u00a024 hours after treatment starts, contact your GP for advice. \n Painkillers \n Taking\u00a0a painkiller such as\u00a0 paracetamol  should help relieve symptoms of pain and a high temperature. \n However,  non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)  such as  ibuprofen  aren't usually recommended to relieve pain during a kidney infection. This is because they\u00a0may increase the risk of further kidney problems. \n Self-help tips \n If you have\u00a0a kidney infection, try not to \"hover\" over the toilet seat when you go to the loo, because it can result in\u00a0your bladder not being fully emptied. \n It's also\u00a0important to drink plenty of fluids, because this will help prevent  dehydration  and will help to flush out the bacteria from your kidneys. Aim to drink enough so that you're frequently passing pale-coloured urine. \n Make sure that you get plenty of rest. A kidney infection can be physically draining, even\u00a0if you're normally healthy and strong. It may take up to two weeks before you're fit enough to return to work. \n Treatment at hospital \n Your GP may refer you to hospital if you have an underlying problem with your urinary tract, which makes you vulnerable to kidney infections. \n It's standard practice to further investigate all men with a kidney infection simply because the condition is much rarer in men. Only women who have had two or more kidney infections tend to be referred.\u00a0Most children with a kidney infection will be treated in hospital. \n Hospital treatment may also be needed\u00a0if: \n \n you're  severely dehydrated  \n you're  unable to swallow  or keep down any fluids or medications \n you have additional symptoms that suggest you may have\u00a0 blood poisoning , such as a rapid heartbeat and losing consciousness \n you're pregnant and you also have a high temperature \n you're particularly frail and\u00a0your general health is poor\u00a0 \n your symptoms fail to improve within 24 hours of starting treatment with antibiotics \n you have a weakened immune system \n you have a foreign body inside your urinary tract, such as a  kidney stone  or a  urinary catheter  \n you have diabetes \n you're over the age of 65 \n you have an underlying condition that affects the\u00a0way your\u00a0kidneys work, such as\u00a0polycystic kidney disease or\u00a0 chronic kidney disease  \n \n If you're admitted to hospital with a kidney infection, you'll probably be attached to a drip so\u00a0you can be given fluids to help keep you hydrated. Antibiotics can also be\u00a0given through the drip. \n You'll have regular blood and urine tests to monitor your health and how effectively the antibiotics\u00a0are fighting off the infection. \n Most people respond well to treatment. As long as there are\u00a0no complications, they're usually well enough to leave hospital within three to seven days.\u00a0Treatment will usually switch to tablets or capsules after you stop receiving\u00a0antibiotics through a drip.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "To work out if you have a kidney infection, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and your recent medical history. \n They will usually also assess your general health by taking your temperature and measuring your blood pressure. \n Urine test \n A urine test can help to establish\u00a0whether you have a  urinary tract infection (UTI) . The test involves taking a small sample of urine and checking it to see if\u00a0there are\u00a0any bacteria in it. \n You'll be given a container and told how to collect the urine, which you can do in the surgery or at home. If you do it at home, you'll need to label the container, seal it in a plastic bag and store it in the fridge. Ideally, hand it in to\u00a0the surgery within four hours. \n A\u00a0urine test can't\u00a0tell\u00a0whether the infection\u00a0\u2013 if\u00a0you have one\u00a0\u2013 is in your kidneys or another part of your urinary system, such as your bladder. \n For your GP to be confident you have a kidney infection, you need to have a positive urine test plus\u00a0certain symptoms, such as a fever or a pain in your side. \n Hospital scans \n You may be referred to hospital for further testing if: \n \n your symptoms fail to respond to treatment with antibiotics \n your symptoms suddenly get worse \n you have additional symptoms that aren't usually associated with a kidney infection \n you're\u00a0at risk of\u00a0 complications of a kidney infection  \n \n  Children with recurrent UTIs \u00a0will also be referred to hospital for further testing. \n In these circumstances,\u00a0scans can check your urinary tract for signs of problems.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Leg cramps", "introduction": "Leg cramps are a common and usually harmless condition where the muscles in your\u00a0leg suddenly become tight and painful. \n It usually occurs in the calf muscles, although it can affect any part of your leg, including your feet and thighs. \n After\u00a0the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours. \n Three out of four\u00a0cases occur at night during sleep. \n Read more about the  symptoms of leg cramps . \n What causes leg cramps? \n Leg cramps can occur for no apparent reason, known as idiopathic leg cramps, or as a symptom or complication of a health condition, known as secondary leg cramps. \n Causes of secondary leg cramps can\u00a0include: \n \n  pregnancy  \n exercise\u00a0 \n certain types of medication, such as  statins  (medicines that help lower cholesterol levels) \n  liver disease  \n \n During a cramp, your muscles suddenly contract (shorten), causing pain in your leg. This is known as a spasm, and you cannot control the affected muscle. \n The cramp can last from a few seconds to 10 minutes. When the spasm passes, you will be able to control the affected muscle again. \n Read more about the  causes of leg cramps . \n When to see your GP \n Speak to\u00a0your GP if your leg cramps are affecting your quality of life; for example, if you have frequent leg cramps or they are interfering with your sleep. \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your legs and feet. They may also ask if you have other symptoms, such as numbness or swelling, which may be a sign that you have secondary leg cramps caused by an underlying condition. \n In this case,\u00a0you may need further tests, such as  blood tests  and urine tests, to rule out other conditions. \n Treating leg cramps \n Most cases of leg cramps can be relieved by exercising the affected muscles. Exercising your legs during the day will often help reduce how often you get cramping episodes. \n Stretches \n To stretch your calf muscles, stand with the front half of your feet on a step, with your heels hanging off the edge. Slowly lower your heels so that they are below the level of the step. Hold for a few seconds before lifting your heels back up to the starting position. Repeat a number of times. \n Medication is usually only needed in the most persistent cases where cramping does not respond to exercise. \n If you have secondary leg cramps, treating the underlying cause may help relieve your symptoms. \n Leg cramps that occur during pregnancy should pass after the baby is born. \n Treating cramps that occur as a result of serious liver disease can be more difficult. Your treatment plan may include using medications such as muscle relaxants. \n Read more about  treating leg cramps  \n Preventing leg cramps \n If you often get leg cramps, regularly stretching the muscles in your lower legs may help prevent the cramps or reduce their frequency. \n You might find it useful to stretch your calves before you go to bed each night (see stretching advice above or try this post-exercise calf stretch). \n The following night-time advice\u00a0may also help: \n \n If you lie on your back, make sure that your toes point upwards \u2013 placing a pillow on its side at the end of your bed, with the soles of your feet propped up against it may help keep your feet in the right position.\u00a0 \n If you lie on your front, hang your feet over the end of the bed \u2013 this will keep your feet in a relaxed position and help stop the muscles in your calves from contracting and tensing. \n Keep your sheets and blankets loose.", "symptoms": "A leg cramp is an episode of sudden pain in the muscles of the leg caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle. \n Most leg cramps occur in the calf muscles and, less commonly, in the feet and thighs. \n Cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes. Thigh muscle cramps\u00a0tend to last the longest. \n During a\u00a0cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and\u00a0the feet and toes will be\u00a0stiff. \n After the cramps have passed, you may have\u00a0pain and tenderness in your legs for several hours. \n When to seek medical advice \n If you only get\u00a0leg cramps\u00a0occasionally, it is\u00a0not a cause for concern and a medical diagnosis is not required. \n A visit to your GP will only be necessary if you get leg cramps frequently, or if they are so\u00a0painful they disrupt your sleep and you are unable to\u00a0function normally the next day. \n You should also visit your GP if the muscles in your legs are shrinking or becoming weaker. \n When to seek immediate medical advice \n There are two situations where\u00a0leg cramps may be a sign\u00a0of a more serious underlying health condition. \n You should seek immediate medical help if: \n \n The cramps last longer than 10 minutes and fail to improve, despite exercise. \n Cramps develop after you come\u00a0into contact with substances that could be toxic (poisonous) or infectious, for example, if you have a cut that is contaminated with soil, which can sometimes cause a bacterial infection, such as tetanus, or after being exposed to elements such as mercury or lead. \n \n In these circumstances, contact your GP for advice immediately. If this isn't possible,\u00a0contact your local out-of-hours service\u00a0or call the\u00a0 NHS 24  '111' service.", "causes": "The cause of leg cramps is sometimes unknown (idiopathic). In other cases, there may be an underlying condition or another identifiable cause. \n Idiopathic leg cramps \n Although the cause of idiopathic leg cramps is unknown, there are a number of theories about what might cause idiopathic leg cramps. These include: \n \n abnormal nerve activity during sleep which causes the muscle of the leg to cramp \n excessive strain placed on leg muscles, such as when exercising,\u00a0may cause the muscles to cramp at certain times \n a sudden restriction in the blood supply to the affected muscles \n \n Also, tendons naturally shorten over time as a person gets older, which may explain\u00a0why older people\u00a0are particularly affected by leg cramps. Tendons are tough bands of tissue that connect muscles to bone. If your\u00a0tendons become too short, they may cause the muscles connected to them to cramp. \n Secondary leg cramps \n Secondary leg cramps are caused by\u00a0an underlying condition or another\u00a0identifiable cause. These\u00a0include: \n \n pregnancy: the extra weight of\u00a0pregnancy can place strain on the leg muscles, making them more vulnerable to cramping \n exercise: leg cramps are often experienced when resting after exercise \n neurological conditions (conditions that affect the nerves in your leg muscles): for example,\u00a0 motor neurone disease  or\u00a0 peripheral neuropathy  \n  liver disease : if your liver stops working properly, toxins will build up in your blood, which can make your muscles go into spasm \n infection: some types of bacterial infection, such as tetanus, can cause muscle cramps and spasm \n toxins: in some people, high levels of toxic (poisonous) substances in the blood, such as lead or mercury, can cause leg cramps \n  dehydration : in some people, low levels of water in the\u00a0body can lead to a drop in your salt levels, which can trigger muscle cramps \n \n Medication \n Certain medications have been known to cause leg cramps in a small number of people. These include: \n \n diuretics: these remove fluid from the body and are used to treat conditions such as  high blood pressure ,\u00a0 heart failure  and some types of  kidney disease  \n  statins : these are\u00a0used to treat people with  high cholesterol  levels\u00a0in their blood\u00a0 \n raloxifene: this is used to prevent  osteoporosis  (thinning of the bones) in women who have experienced\u00a0the\u00a0 menopause  \n nifedipine: this is used to treat  angina  and  Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon \u00a0 \n nicotinic acid: this is\u00a0used to\u00a0treat high cholesterol \n \n Contact your GP if you think\u00a0your medication may be causing your leg cramps as\u00a0your dosage\u00a0may need to be adjusted. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care advises you to do so.", "treatment": "If the cause of your leg cramps is known, it may be possible to treat the underlying cause. \n For example, secondary leg cramps that are related to liver disease are caused by high levels of toxins in the blood which trigger muscles spasms. Therefore, muscle relaxants can be used to help prevent your muscles from going into spasm. \n If the cause of your legs cramps is unknown (primary idiopathic leg cramps), a combination of exercise and painkilling medication is usually recommended. \n Exercises \n Most cases of leg cramps can be treated with exercises. There are two types of exercise that you can do: \n \n exercises you do\u00a0during an episode of cramping to relieve the pain and stop the cramping \n exercises you do during the day to reduce how often you get leg cramps \n \n The two types of exercises are explained below.\u00a0 \n Exercises during cramps \n During an episode of leg cramp, stretch and massage the affected muscle. \n For example, if the cramp is in your calf muscle: \n \n Straighten your leg and lift your foot upwards, bending it at the ankle so that your toes point towards your shin. \n Walk around on your heels for a few minutes. \n \n Exercises to prevent cramps \n To reduce your risk\u00a0of getting\u00a0leg cramps in the future, you should do exercises to stretch the affected muscles three times a day. \n For example, if your calf muscles are affected by cramps, the following exercise should be beneficial: \n \n stand\u00a0about a\u00a0metre away from a wall \n lean forward with your arms outstretched to touch the wall while keeping the soles of your feet flat on the floor \n hold this position for five seconds before releasing \n repeat the exercise for five minutes \n \n For the best results, you should repeat this exercise three times a day, including one session just before you go to bed. \n If you find these exercises useful you can\u00a0carry on doing them for as long as you are able to. \n Painkillers \n If you have leg pain that persists after an episode of cramping, an over-the-counter painkiller, such as  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen  may help reduce the pain. \n Quinine \n Quinine was originally designed as a medication to treat  malaria . Subsequent research has found that it can also be moderately effective in reducing the frequency of leg cramps. \n However, there is a small chance that quinine may cause unpleasant side effects including: \n \n  tinnitus  (ringing in your ears) \n impaired hearing \n  headache \u00a0 \n nausea (feeling sick) \n disturbed vision \n confusion \n hot flushes \n \n Thrombocytopenia is a\u00a0rarer but more serious complication of quinine. It occurs when the number of platelets in your blood\u00a0falls to a dangerously low level. Platelets help the blood to clot which means people with\u00a0thrombocytopenia are at increased risk of\u00a0excessive bleeding such as: \n \n  nosebleeds \u00a0 \n bleeding gums \n bleeding inside the eye \n bleeding inside the skull or digestive system (both of which can be fatal) \n \n There have been a number of reported cases of people dying from thrombocytopenia after taking quinine to prevent leg cramps. \n Never take more than your recommended dose of quinine. An overdose of quinine can result in permanent blindness and death. \n Due to these small but potential risks, your GP will only prescribe quinine if there is evidence that the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risks. \n It is recommended that quinine is only prescribed when: \n \n you have tried the exercise techniques discussed above and they haven't helped prevent your\u00a0leg cramps \n you have frequent leg cramps which affect your quality of life \n \n In these circumstances, you may be prescribed a four-week course of quinine. After this time, if you have not gained any\u00a0benefit, the treatment will be withdrawn. \n If you experience\u00a0any of the side effects listed above, stop taking quinine immediately and contact your GP.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis", "introduction": "This information is about a condition called Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in children. LCH is classified as a cancer and sometimes requires treatment with  chemotherapy . About 50 children in the UK develop LCH each year. It can affect children of any age, and is more common in boys than in girls. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) \n LCH is an unusual condition. It has some characteristics of cancer but, unlike almost every other cancer, it may spontaneously resolve in some patients while being life-threatening in others. LCH is classified as a cancer and sometimes requires treatment with chemotherapy. LCH patients are therefore usually treated by children\u2019s cancer specialists (paediatric oncologists/ haematologists). \n Langerhans refers to Dr Paul Langerhans, who first described the cells in the skin which are similar to the cells found in LCH lesions. \n Histiocytosis refers to histiocytes which are cells that are part of the immune system, and are found in many parts of the body. There are two types of histiocytes: \n \n macrophage/monocyte cells - these destroy harmful proteins, viruses and bacteria in the body \n dendritic cells - these stimulate the immune system \n \n Langerhans cells are dendritic cells and are normally only found in the skin and major airways. In LCH, the abnormal dendritic cells that look similar to Langerhans cells may be found in different parts of the body, including the bone marrow, skin, lungs, liver, lymph glands, spleen and pituitary gland. When these abnormal dendritic cells accumulate in these tissues, they may cause damage. \n LCH is divided into two groups: \n \n single-system LCH - when the disease affects only one part of the body, for example the skin or the bone \n multi-system LCH - when it affects more than one part of the body \n \n Causes \n The cause of LCH is unknown. It cannot be caught from other people and is not passed on in families. \n Signs and symptoms \n The symptoms of LCH will depend on which part of the body is affected and whether the disease is affecting more than one part of the body. The lymph glands may be enlarged, and the child may be irritable and have a poor appetite. Pain in the bone and/or swelling and lumps on the skull can occur if LCH is affecting the bone. A skin rash such as cradle cap or nappy rash may occur if the skin is affected. A discharge from the ear or hearing problems can occur if the ear is affected. The child may have breathing difficulties if LCH affects the lungs or chest. Tummy problems such as diarrhoea and liver problems including jaundice can occur if LCH is within the abdomen. \n In 10\u201320% of patients with multi-system disease, the pituitary gland at the base of the brain is affected, causing hormonal problems. This can lead to the child passing larger amounts of urine and being very thirsty. This is called diabetes insipidus, which is different from sugar diabetes and can be well-controlled with specific medicines. Occasionally, other pituitary hormones may be affected, causing poor growth or delayed puberty, which can also be treated. \n How LCH is diagnosed \n A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose LCH. Tests are likely to include the removal of a sample of cells from an affected part of the body (a biopsy). This is usually done in an operation under a general anaesthetic. The cells are then examined under a microscope. X-rays are taken of the bones, the skull and the lungs. Blood and urine tests will also be done. Additional scans and tests may be required depending on which parts of your child\u2019s body is affected. These tests help the doctors decide whether the disease is a single-system or multi system type. \n When your child is having the tests, they may need to stay in hospital. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. \n Treatment \n Single-system LCH may disappear on its own without any treatment. In some children, treatment such as surgery and  corticosteroids  (such as prednisolone) may be used. Multi-system LCH is usually treated with chemotherapy and corticosteroids. The length of treatment varies from child to child. \n Chemotherapy is anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication that can destroy cancer cells, and corticosteroids are hormonal substances that are naturally produced in the body. Both chemotherapy and corticosteroids can help to destroy the LCH cells. \n Side effects of treatment \n Chemotherapy and corticosteroids used to treat LCH may cause side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the particular treatment being used. \n Side effects of chemotherapy can include feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting,  hair loss , an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding, and tiredness. \n Side effects of corticosteroids can include mood changes and an increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain. All of these side effects should get better when treatment stops. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Research has found that people receiving treatment within clinical trials tend to do as well as, or better than, similar patients treated outside clinical trials. This does not mean that trial treatments are always better. However, hospitals that carry out trials do have access to good equipment and, like all hospitals, they follow precise guidelines when giving treatment. \n Most treatment trials for LCH are set up and organised by The Histiocyte Society, a group of international specialists in histiocytosis. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given time to decide whether it\u2019s right for your child. \n Follow-up care \n It is important to know that the vast majority of children will recover completely from LCH. Some children however, are left with persistent/recurring problems and for a very small number of patients with multi-system LCH, it can be a life-threatening condition. After successfully completing treatment, patients will have follow-up clinic appointments. LCH sometimes comes back (\u2018reactivates\u2019) and may need treatment again. If this happens, treatments for LCH that have worked for them before may be effective again. The same or different treatment may then be required. Patients are also monitored for possible permanent consequences of the disease (e.g. a low production of certain hormones, hearing problems, lung problems) and may need treatment for these conditions. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s specialist medical team who know the situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump. \n This is more likely to happen if you don't drink enough fluids, if you're taking\u00a0some types of\u00a0medication,\u00a0or if you have\u00a0a medical condition\u00a0that raises the levels of certain substances in your urine. \n Read more about the  causes of kidney stones . \n After a kidney stone has formed,\u00a0your body\u00a0will try to pass it\u00a0out when you go to the toilet (in the urine). This means\u00a0it will often travel through the urinary system (the kidneys, kidney tubes and bladder). \n Treating and preventing kidney stones \n Most kidney stones\u00a0are small enough to be passed in your urine, and it may be possible to treat the symptoms at home with medication. \n Larger stones may need to be broken up using ultrasound or\u00a0laser energy. Occasionally, keyhole surgery may be needed to remove very large kidney stones directly. \n Read more about  treating kidney stones . \n It's estimated that\u00a0up to\u00a0half of all people who have had kidney stones will experience them again within the following five\u00a0years. \n To avoid getting kidney stones, make sure you drink plenty of water every day\u00a0so you don't become  dehydrated .

It may even go undetected and pass out painlessly when you urinate. \n Symptoms usually occur if the kidney stone: \n \n gets stuck in your kidney \n starts to travel down the ureter (the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder)\u00a0\u2013 the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can\u00a0cause pain as they try to pass through \n causes an infection \n \n In these cases, the symptoms of kidney stones can include: \n \n a persistent ache in the lower back,\u00a0which is sometimes also felt in the groin\u00a0\u2013 men may have pain in their\u00a0testicles and scrotum \n periods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen, or occasionally in your groin, which\u00a0may last for minutes or hours \n feeling restless and unable to lie still \n nausea (feeling sick) \n needing to urinate more often than normal \n pain when you urinate (dysuria) \n blood in your urine (haematuria) \u2013 this\u00a0may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or ureter \n \n Blocked ureter and kidney infection \n A kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection. This is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage, which may cause a build-up of bacteria. \n The\u00a0 symptoms of a kidney infection \u00a0are similar to symptoms of\u00a0kidney stones, but may also include: \n \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over \n chills and shivering \n feeling very weak or tired \n  diarrhoea  \n cloudy and bad-smelling urine \n \n  Read more about kidney infections .", "causes": "Kidney stones are usually formed following a build-up of certain chemicals in the body. \n This build-up\u00a0may be any of the following: \n \n calcium \n ammonia \n uric acid\u00a0\u2013 a waste product produced when the body breaks down food to use as energy \n cysteine\u00a0\u2013 an amino acid that helps to build protein \n \n Certain medical conditions can lead to an unusually high level of these substances in your urine. \n You're also\u00a0more likely to develop kidney stones if you don't drink enough fluids. \n Recurrent kidney stones\u00a0 \n Some people are particularly likely to keep\u00a0on developing kidney stones, including people who: \n \n eat a high-protein, low-fibre diet \n are\u00a0inactive or bed-bound \n have a family history of kidney stones \n have had several kidney or urinary infections \n have had a kidney stone before, particularly if it was before you were 25 \n have only one fully working kidney \n have had an intestinal bypass (surgery on your digestive system), or a condition affecting the small intestine, such as\u00a0 Crohn's disease  \n \n Medication \n There's evidence to suggest that certain medications may increase your risk of developing recurrent kidney stones. These include: \n \n  aspirin \u00a0 \n antacids\u00a0 \n diuretics (used to reduce fluid build-up) \n certain  antibiotics  \n certain antiretroviral medication\u00a0(used to treat  HIV ) \n certain anti-epileptic medication \n \n Types of kidney stones \n Kidney stones can develop for a number of reasons. The causes of the four main types of kidney stone are outlined below. \n Calcium stones \n Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and form if there's too much calcium in the urine, which can be due to: \n \n an inherited\u00a0condition called hypercalcuria, which leads to\u00a0large amounts of calcium in urine \n an overactive parathyroid gland (the parathyroid glands help to regulate the amount of calcium in your body) \n  kidney disease  \n a rare condition called sarcoidosis\u00a0 \n some cancers \n \n Calcium stones are usually either large and smooth or spiky and rough. \n Struvite stones \n Struvite stones are often caused by infections, and they most commonly occur after a\u00a0 urinary tract infection \u00a0that's lasted a long time. \n Struvite stones are more common in women than men. \n Uric acid stones \n Uric acid stones can form if there's a large amount of acid in your urine. They may be caused by: \n \n eating a high-protein diet that includes lots of meat \n a condition\u00a0such as  gout \u00a0that prevents the body breaking down certain chemicals\u00a0 \n an inherited condition that causes higher than normal levels of acid in the body \n  chemotherapy  \n \n Cystine stones \n Cystine stones are the rarest type of kidney stone. They're caused by an inherited condition called cystinuria, which affects the amount of acid that is passed in your urine.", "treatment": "Most kidney stones are small enough (less than 4mm in diameter) to be passed out in your urine and can probably be treated at home. \n But even small kidney stones can be painful, although this\u00a0usually only lasts a couple of days and disappears when the stone has been passed. \n Medication \n If you are in severe pain, your GP can give you pain relief by injection. A second dose can be given after half an hour if you're still experiencing pain. \n Medication can also be injected to treat the symptoms of nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. This is called an anti-emetic (anti-sickness) medication. \n You may also be given a prescription for painkillers, anti-emetics, or both, to take at home. \n Self care \n You may be advised to wait until you pass your kidney stone when you go to the toilet, and to try to collect it from your urine. You can do this by filtering your urine through gauze or a stocking. \n Give the stone to your GP so that they can have it analysed to help determine any further treatment you may need. \n You should drink enough water to make your urine colourless. If your urine is yellow or brown, you're not drinking enough. \n Admission to hospital \n If your kidney stone has moved into your ureter (the tube that carries waste products from the kidneys to the bladder), and it's causing severe pain, your GP may admit you to hospital for treatment. \n This may be necessary if: \n \n you're at an increased risk of your kidneys failing\u00a0(for example, because you only have one kidney) \n your symptoms don't improve within an hour of being given painkillers or anti-sickness medication \n you're\u00a0dehydrated and vomiting too much to keep fluids down \n you're pregnant \n you're over 60 years of age \n \n Treating large kidney stones \n If a kidney stone is too big to be passed naturally\u00a0\u2013 6-7mm\u00a0(about 0.23 to 0.27in)\u00a0in diameter or larger \u2013 you may need treatment to remove it another way. \n This could include: \n \n extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) \n ureteroscopy \n percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) \n open surgery \n \n These procedures are explained in more detail below. The type of treatment you have will depend on the size and location of your stones.\u00a0 \n Extracorporeal\u00a0shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) \n ESWL is the most common way of treating kidney stones that can't be passed in the urine. \n It involves using\u00a0 ultrasound  (high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is. Ultrasound shock waves are then sent to the stone from a machine to break it into smaller pieces, so it can be passed in your urine. \n ESWL can be an uncomfortable form of treatment, so it's usually carried out after giving painkilling medication. \n You may need more than one session of ESWL to successfully treat your kidney stones. ESWL is up to 99% effective for stones up to 20mm (0.8in) in diameter.\u00a0 \n Ureteroscopy \n If a kidney stone is stuck in the ureter, you may need to have a ureteroscopy, which is also sometimes known as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). \n It\u00a0involves passing a long, thin telescope called a ureteroscope through your urethra (the tube\u00a0urine passes through on its way out of the body) and\u00a0into your bladder. It's then passed up into your ureter to where the stone is stuck. \n The surgeon may either try to\u00a0gently remove the stone using another instrument, or they may use laser energy to break it up into small pieces so that it can be passed naturally in your urine. \n Ureteroscopy is carried out under  general anaesthetic \u00a0(where you're unconscious), so you shouldn't drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure. \n For stones up to 15mm (0.6in), a ureteroscopy is effective in 50-80% of cases. \n A\u00a0plastic tube called a stent may need to be\u00a0temporarily inserted inside you to allow the stone fragments to drain into the bladder. \n Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) \n PCNL is an alternative procedure that may be used for larger stones. It may also be used\u00a0if ESWL isn't suitable\u00a0\u2013 for example, because the person being treated is obese.\u00a0 \n PCNL involves using a thin telescopic instrument called a nephroscope. A small incision is made in your back and the nephroscope is passed through it and into your kidney. The stone is either pulled out or broken into smaller pieces using a laser or pneumatic energy. \n PCNL is always carried out under general anaesthetic,\u00a0so you shouldn't drive or operate machinery for up to 48 hours after the procedure. \n PCNL is 86% effective for stones that are 21-30mm (0.8-1.2in) in diameter.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Open surgery \n Nowadays, open surgery for kidney stones is rare (less than 1% of cases require this type of surgery). It's only usually used if there's a very large stone or abnormal anatomy.\u00a0 \n During open surgery, an incision will be made in your back so that your surgeon is able to access your ureter and kidney. The kidney stone can then be removed.\u00a0 \n Treating uric acid stones \n If you have a uric acid stone, you may be advised to drink around three litres (just over five pints) of water each day to try to dissolve it. \n Uric acid stones are much softer than other types of kidney stone, and they can be made smaller if they're exposed to alkaline fluids. \n You\u00a0may need to take some medication to make your urine more alkaline before the uric acid stone starts to dissolve. \n Complications of treatment \n Complications can occur following the treatment of large kidney stones. Your surgeon should explain these to you before you have the procedure. \n Possible complications will depend on the type of treatment you have and the size and position of your stones.\u00a0Complications could include: \n \n  sepsis \u00a0\u2013 an infection that spreads through the blood, causing symptoms throughout the whole body \n a blocked ureter\u00a0\u2013 caused by stone\u00a0fragments; the ureter is the tube that attaches the kidney to the bladder \n an injury to the ureter \n a  urinary tract infection  \n bleeding during surgery \n pain \n \n It's estimated that 5-9% of people may experience complications after having a ureteroscopy.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will usually be able to diagnose kidney stones from your symptoms and medical history. \n It will be particularly easy if you've had kidney stones before. \n You may be given tests, including: \n \n urine tests to check for infections and pieces of stones \n an examination of any stones that you pass in your urine \n  blood tests  to check that your kidneys are working properly, and to also check the levels of substances that could cause kidney stones, such as calcium \n \n You can collect\u00a0a kidney stone by urinating through some gauze or a stocking. \n Having a kidney stone to analyse will make a diagnosis easier, and may help your GP determine which treatment method will be of most benefit to you. \n If you have severe pain that isn't controlled by painkillers, or if you have a high temperature as well as pain, you may be referred to a urologist (a specialist in treating urinary problems). \n Imaging tests \n If you're\u00a0referred to hospital for an imaging test,\u00a0a number of different techniques may be used. Imaging tests can help confirm the diagnosis, or identify precisely where a kidney stone is. \n These tests\u00a0include: \n \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan \u00a0\u2013 where a series of X-rays at slightly different angles are taken and a computer is used to put the images together \n  X-ray \u00a0\u2013 an imaging technique that uses high-energy\u00a0radiation to highlight abnormalities in body tissue \n an  ultrasound scan \u00a0\u2013\u00a0uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body \n an intravenous urogram (IVU) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP) \u2013 a dye that shows up on X-ray is injected into a vein in your arm; the X-ray image highlights any blockages as the kidneys filter the dye out of your blood and into your\u00a0urine \n \n CT scans are now often used because they're thought to be more accurate (IVUs were previously the preferred imaging method). The imaging technique you have may depend on what's available\u00a0at your local hospital."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Lactose intolerance", "introduction": "Lactose intolerance is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products. \n Symptoms of lactose intolerance\u00a0usually develop within a few hours of consuming food\u00a0or drink that contains lactose. They may include: \n \n  flatulence  (wind) \n  diarrhoea  \n bloated stomach \n stomach cramps and pains \n stomach rumbling \n feeling sick \n \n The severity of your symptoms and when they appear depends on the amount of lactose you've consumed. \n Some people may still be able to drink a small glass of milk without triggering any symptoms, while others may not even be able to have milk in their tea or coffee. \n When to seek medical advice \n The symptoms of lactose intolerance can be similar to several other conditions, so it's important to see your GP for a diagnosis before removing milk and dairy products from your diet. \n For example, the symptoms above can also be caused by: \n \n  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u00a0\u2013 a long-term disorder that affects the digestive system \n milk protein intolerance \u2013 an adverse reaction to the protein in milk from cows (not the same as a milk  allergy ) \n \n If your GP thinks\u00a0you\u00a0have lactose intolerance,\u00a0they may suggest avoiding foods and drinks containing lactose for two weeks to see if your symptoms improve. \n Read more about  diagnosing lactose intolerance  \n What causes lactose intolerance? \n The body digests lactose using a substance called lactase. This breaks down lactose into two sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream. \n People with\u00a0lactose intolerance\u00a0don't produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system where it's fermented by bacteria. This leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. \n Depending on the underlying reason why the body isn't producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent. Most cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks. \n Read more about the  causes of lactose intolerance  \n Who's affected? \n In the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent. \n Lactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected. \n Is it an allergy? \n Lactose\u00a0intolerance isn't the same as a milk or dairy allergy.  Food allergies  are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food. This\u00a0causes symptoms such as\u00a0a rash, wheezing and itching. \n If you're allergic to something, even a tiny particle can be enough to trigger a reaction, while most people with lactose intolerance can still consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing any problems (although this varies from person to person). \n Treating lactose intolerance \n There's no cure for lactose intolerance, but limiting your intake of food and drink containing lactose usually helps to\u00a0control the symptoms. \n Depending on what dairy products you're able to eat, you may also require additional\u00a0calcium\u00a0and\u00a0vitamin D\u00a0supplements to keep\u00a0your bones strong and healthy. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a dietitian for further advice. \n In addition to dietary changes, lactase substitutes\u00a0may\u00a0also be helpful. These are\u00a0drops or tablets you can take with your meals or drinks to improve your digestion\u00a0of lactose. \n Read more about  treating lactose intolerance  \n Complications of lactose intolerance \n Milk and other dairy products contain calcium, protein and\u00a0vitamins such as A, B12 and D. Lactose also helps your body absorb a number of other minerals, such as magnesium and zinc. These\u00a0 vitamins and minerals  are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. \n If you're lactose intolerant, getting the right amount of important vitamins and minerals can prove difficult. This may lead to unhealthy weight loss and\u00a0put you at increased risk of developing the following conditions: \n \n Osteopenia \u2013\u00a0where you have a very low bone-mineral density. If osteopenia is not treated, it can develop into osteoporosis. \n  Osteoporosis  \u2013 where your bones become thin and weak. If you have osteoporosis, your risk of getting fractures and broken bones is increased. \n  Malnutrition  \u2013 when the food you eat doesn't give you the nutrients essential for a healthy functioning body. If you're malnourished, wounds can take longer to heal and you may start to feel tired or depressed. \n \n If you're concerned that dietary restrictions are putting you at risk of complications, you may find it helpful to consult a dietitian. They can advise you on your diet and whether you require food supplements. \n Your GP should be able to refer you to an NHS dietitian free of charge. Alternatively, you can contact a private dietician. The  British Dietetic Association  has information on how to find a private dietitian.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Lactose intolerance is usually the result of your body not producing enough lactase. \n Lactase is an enzyme (a protein that causes a chemical reaction to occur) normally produced in your small intestine that's used to digest lactose. \n If you have a lactase deficiency, it means your body doesn't produce enough lactase. \n Digesting lactose \n After eating or drinking something containing lactose, it passes down your oesophagus (gullet) into your stomach, where it's digested. The digested food then passes into your small intestine. \n The lactase in your small intestine should break lactose down into glucose and galactose (other types of sugar), which are then absorbed into your bloodstream. If there isn't enough lactase, the unabsorbed lactose moves through your digestive system to your colon (large intestine). \n Bacteria in the colon ferment (break down) the lactose, producing fatty acids and gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The breakdown of the lactose in the colon, and the resulting acids and gases that are produced, cause the symptoms of lactose intolerance such as  flatulence  and bloating. \n Types of lactase deficiency \n The main types of lactase deficiency are outlined below. \n Primary lactase deficiency \n Primary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance worldwide. This type of lactase deficiency is caused by an inherited genetic fault that runs in families. \n Primary lactase deficiency develops when your lactase production decreases as your diet becomes less reliant on milk and dairy products. This is usually after the age of two, when breastfeeding or bottle-feeding has stopped, although the symptoms may not be noticeable until adulthood. \n Secondary lactase deficiency \n Secondary lactase deficiency is a shortage of lactase caused by a problem in your small intestine. It can occur at any age, and may be the result of another condition, surgery to your small intestine, or taking certain medication. \n Secondary lactase deficiency is the most common cause of lactose intolerance in the UK, particularly in babies and young children. \n Possible causes of secondary lactase deficiency include: \n \n  gastroenteritis \u00a0\u2013 an infection of the stomach and intestines \n  coeliac disease \u00a0\u2013 a bowel condition caused by an adverse reaction to a protein called gluten \n  Crohn's disease \u00a0\u2013 a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system \n  ulcerative colitis \u00a0\u2013 a long-term condition that affects the large intestine \n  chemotherapy \u00a0\u2013 a cancer treatment \n long courses of  antibiotics  \n \n The decrease in the production of lactase in secondary lactase deficiency is sometimes only temporary, but it may be permanent if it's caused by a long-term condition. \n It's also possible to develop secondary lactase deficiency later in life, even without another condition to trigger it. This is because your body's production of lactase naturally reduces as you get older. \n Congenital lactase deficiency \n Congenital lactase deficiency is a rare condition that runs in families and is found in newborn babies. \n It's caused by an inherited\u00a0genetic fault that means affected babies produce very little or no lactase. \n The genetic mutation responsible for\u00a0congenital lactase deficiency is passed on in an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. This means\u00a0both parents must have a copy of the faulty gene to pass on\u00a0the condition. \n Developmental\u00a0lactase deficiency \n Some babies born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) have a temporary lactose intolerance because their small intestine wasn't fully developed\u00a0by the time they were born. \n This is known as developmental lactase deficiency and it usually improves as\u00a0affected babies get older.", "treatment": "There's no cure for lactose intolerance, but most people are able to control their symptoms by making changes to their diet. \n Some cases of lactose intolerance, such as those caused by  gastroenteritis , are only temporary and will improve within a few days or weeks. Other cases, such as\u00a0those caused by an inherited genetic fault or a long-term underlying condition, are likely to be lifelong. \n Changing your diet \n In most cases, cutting down on or avoiding sources of lactose and replacing them with lactose-free alternatives is enough to control the symptoms of lactose intolerance. \n The exact changes you need to make to your diet depend on how sensitive you are to lactose. Some people are able to tolerate some lactose in their diet without any problems, whereas others experience symptoms after consuming food containing only a tiny amount of lactose. \n If you decide to experiment with what you can and can't eat, make sure\u00a0to introduce new foods gradually, rather than all at once. This will help you to get used to any foods you might be sensitive to and identify any that cause problems. \n Eating fewer products containing lactose, or avoiding them completely, can mean you miss out on certain  vitamins and minerals  in your diet and increase your risk of complications. You'll also need to make sure you're getting enough\u00a0nutrition from either lacto-free foods or dietary supplements. \n If you or your child are extremely sensitive to lactose, talk to your GP about your diet. \n Milk products are rich in calcium needed for healthy bones so you may need to have regular bone density checks. \n You may be referred to a dietitian (an expert in diet and nutrition) who\u00a0can advise about what foods should be included in your, or your child's, diet. \n Sources of lactose \n Some of the main sources of lactose you may need to cut down on or avoid if you're lactose intolerant are described below. \n Milk \n A major source of lactose is milk, including cow's milk, goat's milk and sheep's milk. Depending on how mild or severe your lactose intolerance is, you may need to change the amount of milk in your diet. \n For example: \n \n you may be able to have milk in your tea or coffee, but not on your cereal \n some products containing milk, such as milk chocolate, may still be acceptable in small quantities \n you may find that drinking milk as part of a meal, rather than on its own, improves how the lactose is absorbed \n \n If even a small amount of milk triggers your symptoms, there are some alternatives you can try, such as soya or rice milk (see below). \n Dairy products \n Other dairy products made from milk, such as butter, ice cream and cheese, can also contain high levels of lactose and may need to be avoided if you're lactose intolerant. \n Some dairy products however, such as hard cheese and yoghurt, contain lower levels of lactose than milk and other products, so you may still be able to have them. \n It's worth experimenting with different foods to find out if there are any dairy products you can eat because they're a good source of\u00a0essential nutrients such as\u00a0calcium. \n Other foods and drinks \n As well as milk and dairy products, there are other foods and drinks that can sometimes contain lactose. \n These include: \n \n salad cream, salad dressing and mayonnaise \n biscuits \n chocolate \n boiled sweets \n cakes \n some types of bread and other baked goods \n some breakfast cereals \n packets of mixes to make pancakes and biscuits \n packets of instant potatoes and instant soup \n some processed meats, such as sliced ham \n \n Check the ingredients of all food and drink products carefully, because milk or lactose are often hidden ingredients. \n The lactose found in some foods\u00a0won't necessarily be listed separately on the food label, so you need to check the ingredients list for milk, whey, curds and milk\u00a0products such as cheese, butter and cream. \n Some ingredients may sound like they contain lactose when they don't, such as\u00a0lactic acid, sodium lactate and cocoa butter. These ingredients don't need to be avoided if you're lactose intolerant. \n Medication \n Some prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines and complementary medicines may contain a small amount of lactose. While this isn't usually enough to trigger the symptoms of lactose intolerance in most people, it may cause problems if your intolerance is severe or you're taking several different medicines. \n If you need to start taking a new medication, check with your GP or pharmacist in case it contains lactose. \n Lactose-free foods and drinks \n There are a number of alternative foods and drinks available in supermarkets to replace the milk and dairy products you need to avoid. \n Food and drinks that don't usually contain lactose include: \n \n soya milks, yoghurts and some cheeses \n milks made from rice, oats, almonds, hazelnuts, coconut, quinoa, and potato \n foods which carry the 'dairy-free' or 'suitable for vegans' signs \n carob bars \n \n You can also buy cow's milk containing additional lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose). This means you still get the nutritional benefits of the milk, but you're less likely to experience any symptoms after consuming it. \n Getting enough calcium \n If you're unable to eat most dairy products, you may not be getting enough calcium in your daily diet.\u00a0Calcium has several important functions, including: \n \n helping build strong bones and teeth \n regulating muscle contractions (including heartbeat) \n ensuring blood clots normally \n \n Therefore, it's a good idea\u00a0to choose lactose-free products with added calcium and ensure your diet contains alternative sources of calcium, such as: \n \n green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage and okra \n soya beans \n tofu \n nuts \n bread and anything made with fortified flour \n fish containing edible bones (for example, sardines, salmon, and pilchards) \n \n You can also buy combined calcium and vitamin D supplements from most pharmacists to help maintain good bone health. \n It's important to check with your GP or dietitian whether you should be taking supplements, however, as taking excessively high levels of calcium can cause side effects. \n Lactase substitutes \n In addition to dietary changes, you may also find it useful to take\u00a0liquid drops, tablets or capsules that contain\u00a0lactase substitutes. These are available from most health foods shops. \n Lactase substitutes replace the lactase your small intestine isn't producing, which\u00a0can reduce your symptoms by helping your body break down any lactose in your diet more easily. \n Lactase substitutes\u00a0can either be added to milk\u00a0or taken just\u00a0before eating a meal containing lactose. \n Lactose intolerance in children \n If your child is lactose intolerant, they may be able to consume small amounts of lactose without experiencing symptoms. This is quite safe, but you may need to experiment to find out how much they can comfortably eat or drink. \n If your child is unable to tolerate any lactose, your doctor\u00a0may refer you to a dietitian for nutritional advice because it's important\u00a0for young children to have certain nutrients in their diet to ensure healthy growth and development. \n In general, the same rules about foods to try or to avoid are similar for children and adults (see above). \n For babies with lactose intolerance, lactose-free formula milk is available to buy from pharmacies and supermarkets. However, soya formula isn't recommended for children under six months because it contains hormones that may interfere with your baby's future physical and sexual development. \n Breastfed babies may benefit from lactase substitute drops to help their bodies digest the lactose in breast milk. \n For many children, lactose intolerance is only temporary and will improve after a few weeks. After this point it's safe to gradually reintroduce milk and dairy products into their diet.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It's important to visit your GP if you think you or your child may have lactose intolerance, as the symptoms can be similar to other conditions. \n Before seeing your GP, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what symptoms you experience. Tell your GP if you notice any patterns, or if there are any foods you seem particularly sensitive to. \n Your GP may suggest trying to\u00a0remove lactose from your diet for two weeks to see if it helps to relieve your symptoms. This will provide further evidence\u00a0of whether\u00a0you're lactose intolerant. \n Further testing \n Other tests aren't usually needed, but your GP may sometimes suggest further tests to: \n \n help confirm the diagnosis \n find out how much lactase (the enzyme used to digest lactose) your body is producing \n try to determine what might be causing your lactose intolerance \n \n Some of the main tests that may be\u00a0used\u00a0are described below. \n Hydrogen breath test \n A hydrogen breath test is a simple way of determining if you may be lactose intolerant. \n You'll be asked to avoid eating or drinking during the night before the test. When you arrive for the test, you'll be asked to blow up a balloon-like bag.\u00a0This sample of your breath will be tested to find out how much hydrogen is present, measured in parts per million (ppm). \n You'll then be given a drink of lactose solution\u00a0and your breath will be tested every 15 minutes over the next few hours to see if the level of hydrogen changes. \n If your breath contains a large amount of hydrogen (more than 20ppm above your baseline) after consuming the lactose solution, it's likely that you're lactose intolerant. This is\u00a0because\u00a0lactose intolerance can cause the bacteria in the colon (large intestine) to produce more hydrogen than normal. \n Lactose tolerance test \n In a lactose tolerance test, you'll be given a drink of lactose solution and a blood sample will be taken from your arm using a needle. The blood will be tested to see how much glucose (blood sugar) it contains. \n If you're lactose intolerant, your blood sugar levels will either rise slowly, or not at all. This is because your body is unable to break down the lactose into glucose. \n Milk tolerance test \n In a milk tolerance test, you'll be given a glass of milk (about 500ml) and your blood sugar levels will be tested. If your blood sugar levels don't rise after drinking the milk, you may be lactose intolerant. \n Small bowel biopsy \n A\u00a0small bowel biopsy is rarely used to diagnose lactose intolerance. However, it may be carried out to see if your symptoms are being caused by another condition, such as\u00a0 coeliac disease . \n In a small bowel biopsy, a sample of your small intestinal lining is taken using an\u00a0endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a light and a tiny cutting tool at the end) that's passed down your throat. This will be carried out under\u00a0 local anaesthetic , so it won't hurt. \n The sample of intestinal lining will be tested to see how much lactase it contains. If it only contains a small amount of lactase,\u00a0it's likely you're lactose intolerant. The sample can also be examined to look for signs of possible underlying conditions such as coeliac disease."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Kidney cancer", "introduction": "Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in adults in the UK, with just over 10,100 people diagnosed each year. \n Signs and symptoms of kidney cancer can include: \n \n blood in your urine\u00a0 \n a constant pain in your side, just below the ribs \n a lump or swelling in the kidney area (on either side of the body) \n \n See your GP as soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms. They will examine you and may refer you to a specialist clinic for further tests. \n In around half of all cases of kidney cancer there are no symptoms, and the condition is detected during tests for other unrelated conditions. \n Read more about the  symptoms of kidney cancer \u00a0and  diagnosing kidney cancer . \n The kidneys and cancer \n The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on either side of the body, just underneath the ribcage. \n Their main role is to filter out waste products from the blood, in addition to producing urine. Only one of the kidneys is usually affected by cancer. \n The human body is made up of billions of cells, which normally grow and multiply in an orderly way, with new cells being created only when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. \n Exactly what triggers this growth\u00a0is unknown; however, there are certain risk factors that can increase the chances of the condition developing, such as\u00a0 smoking  and  obesity . \n Kidney cancer most frequently affects people over 50 years of age and is more common among men. \n Read more about the  causes of kidney cancer . \n Types of kidney cancer \n Many different types of cancer can affect the kidneys. The most common type is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of all kidney cancers. \n Rarer types of kidney cancer include: \n \n transitional cell cancer \u2013 develops in the lining of the kidneys and usually affects men who are 50 years of age or over \n Wilms\u2019 tumour \u2013 a rare type of kidney cancer that affects children \n \n This topic focuses on RCC. See the\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website for more information about  transitional cell cancer  and  Wilms\u2019 tumour . \n Treating kidney cancer \n The earlier kidney cancer is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat. \n How it's treated will depend on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery to remove the cancerous cells is usually the first course of action. \n Unlike most other cancers,\u00a0 chemotherapy  isn't very effective at treating kidney cancer. However, non-surgical treatments are available, such as\u00a0 radiotherapy  or targeted therapies. These are most commonly used in the more advanced stages of kidney cancer, when the cancer has spread beyond the kidney. \n Read more about  treating kidney cancer . \n Preventing kidney cancer \n As the causes of kidney cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to fully prevent it. \n However, leading a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of developing the condition. A combination of a\u00a0 healthy diet  and\u00a0 regular exercise  will help to avoid becoming overweight or obese, which is a significant risk factor for kidney cancer. \n If you're overweight or obese, you can lose weight and maintain a healthy weight by combining regular exercise with a calorie-controlled diet. \n Read more about  treating obesity . \n Outlook \n The outlook for kidney cancer is usually good if the condition is diagnosed in its early stages, when the cancer is still contained inside the kidney. \n Kidney cancer can often be completely cured by removing some or all of the kidney. This is\u00a0because it's possible to live a healthy life with only one kidney. Around one in three cases of kidney cancer are diagnosed at an early stage. \n Depending on how aggressive the cancer is, 65-90% of people will live at least five years after receiving an early\u00a0diagnosis of kidney cancer, with many people living much longer. \n The outlook for kidney cancer that's spread outside the kidney is less favourable. Around 40-70% of people with this stage of kidney cancer will live at least five years after receiving a diagnosis. \n In cases where kidney cancer is advanced and has spread to other parts of the body, only around 10% of\u00a0people will live for at least five years after receiving a diagnosis.", "symptoms": "Most cases of kidney cancer don't cause any symptoms in the early stages. \n The most common symptoms of mid- to advanced-stage kidney cancer are: \n \n blood in your urine (haematuria) \u2013 the amount of blood is usually high enough to change the colour of your urine to a reddish or dark brown colour \n a\u00a0persistent\u00a0pain in your side, just below the ribs \n a lump or swelling in the area of your\u00a0kidneys (on either side of the body) \n \n However, in around half of all cases the cancer causes no symptoms and is only detected during a routine  ultrasound scan . \n Less common symptoms of kidney cancer include: \n \n extreme tiredness (fatigue) or  anaemia  \n unintentional weight loss \n a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above \n night sweats\u00a0 \n a general sense of feeling unwell \n swelling of the veins in the testicles (in men) \n loss of appetite \n  high blood pressure (hypertension)  \n \n When to seek medical advice \n See\u00a0your GP immediately if you have pain or a swelling or lump in your kidney area (on either side of your body, just below your ribcage). \n You should also see your GP if you\u00a0have blood in your urine. Although it's highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could\u00a0be\u00a0a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as a\u00a0 kidney stone  or bladder stone.", "causes": "", "treatment": "The treatment of kidney cancer depends on the size and spread of the cancer. Surgery is the most common first course of action, with the aim of removing the cancer cells. \n Unlike most other cancers, chemotherapy isn't very effective in treating kidney cancer. However, there are non-surgical treatments available, such as radiotherapy or targeted drug therapies. \n The main treatments for kidney cancer are covered in detail below and\u00a0include: \n \n  nephrectomy  \n  embolisation  \n  radiotherapy \u00a0 \n  targeted therapies \u00a0 \n  immunotherapy  \n \n Your treatment plan \n You can expect to be cared for by a multidisciplinary team, often comprising a specialist cancer surgeon, an oncologist (who specialises in radiotherapy and  chemotherapy ), a radiologist, a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) and a specialist nurse. \n You'll be\u00a0given a key worker, usually\u00a0the specialist nurse, who will be responsible for coordinating your care. \n Your team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. \n When deciding what treatment is best for you, your doctors will consider: \n \n the\u00a0 stage and grade of your cancer  (how big it is and how far it's spread) \n your age and general health \n \n If the cancer hasn't spread out of your kidney (T1 or T2 kidney cancer), it can usually be cured by removing some or all of the kidney. \n If the cancer has spread out of your kidney (T3 or T4 kidney cancer), a complete cure may not be possible. However, it should be possible to slow the cancer's progression and treat any symptoms. \n Surgical treatments \n Nephrectomy \n A nephrectomy is an operation to remove a kidney. \n If the tumour is less than 4cm (1.5 inches) in diameter, it may only be necessary to remove some of your kidney. This is known as a partial nephrectomy. A partial nephrectomy may also be required if your remaining kidney is in poor health. \n If the tumour is more than 4cm in diameter, your entire kidney will need to be removed. Even if the cancer has spread beyond your kidney, you may still benefit from having your kidney removed. \n Removing the kidney can help resolve the pain, and make other types of non-surgical treatment more effective. \n It's possible to live a normal life with only one kidney, because the other kidney will be able to compensate. \n During a nephrectomy, the surgeon may also remove nearby lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the kidney. \n There are two ways that both a partial and open nephrectomy can be performed They are an: \n \n open nephrectomy \u2013 where the kidney is removed through a large incision in your abdomen (stomach) \n laparoscopic or keyhole nephrectomy \u2013 where\u00a0a series of smaller incisions are made in your abdomen, and the kidney is removed using small surgical instruments \n \n Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages. \n A laparoscopic nephrectomy has a considerably quicker recovery time than an open nephrectomy. \n However, the procedure requires surgeons with specialised training, so you may have to wait longer to receive treatment than you would if you\u00a0decided to have an open nephrectomy. \n Some types of kidney cancer, where the tumour is located in the centre of the kidney, may not be suitable for a laparoscopic nephrectomy. \n One of the main disadvantages of an open nephrectomy is that it's a major surgical procedure that can place a considerable strain on the body. This means it may not be suitable for people who are particularly frail or unwell. \n You should discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with your surgical team. \n Embolisation \n If you're unable to have a nephrectomy, you may benefit from an alternative\u00a0operation known as embolisation. \n During embolisation, the surgeon will insert a small tube called a catheter into your groin, then use\u00a0 X-ray  images to guide the catheter into the blood supply of your kidney. A substance will then be injected through the catheter to block the blood supply to your kidney. \n By blocking blood supply to the kidney, any tumours that are present will become starved of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to shrink. \n Non-surgical treatments for advanced kidney cancer \n Kidney cancer is one of the few types of cancer that's less responsive to  chemotherapy  (where powerful medication is used to kill cancerous cells). \n However, a number of\u00a0clinical trials are under way that are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medications that appear to be benefiting some people. \n There are also a number of different non-surgical treatments that can slow the spread of the cancer and help control its symptoms. \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0can't usually cure kidney cancer, but it can\u00a0slow down its progress and help reduce pain. You should only need a few minutes of radiotherapy every day, for a number of days. \n When radiotherapy is used to control the symptoms of cancer rather than cure it, the side effects tend to be mild. Possible side effects may include fatigue (tiredness), nausea and vomiting \n Cryotherapy \n Cryotherapy involves killing cancer cells by freezing them. It may be\u00a0used if a person isn't fit enough for surgery, or if their tumour is small. \n Cryotherapy is usually classed as either percutaneous (where needles are\u00a0passed through the skin) or laparoscopic (where needles are placed directly into the kidney through a small incision). \n Side effects include bleeding around the kidney and injury to the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter). \n Radiofrequency ablation \n Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses heat generated by radio waves to kill cancer cells. This is a percutaneous treatment, meaning no incision is needed. \n This treatment is only available at specialist centres. It's mainly used if you're not strong enough for surgery or your kidney cancer is in the early stages. \n RFA\u00a0can't be used if the cancer is too close to other organs, such as the bowel. \n Side effects include bleeding in the treatment area, a collection of blood (haematoma) near the kidney, and problems passing urine due to the narrowing of the tube that joins the kidney to the bladder (the ureter). \n Want to know more? \n Targeted therapies \n A number of\u00a0new medicines have been developed for the treatment of kidney cancer. These are: \n \n sunitinib\u00a0 \n pazopanib \n axitinib \n sorafenib \n temsirolimus \n everolimus \n bevacizumab \n \n These medicines are sometimes referred to as \"targeted therapies\" because they're designed to target and interrupt the functions needed by cancer to grow and spread. \n At present, only sunitinib, pazopanib and axitinib\u00a0have been recommended by the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) . They're available on the NHS for people who are still relatively healthy and have advanced kidney cancer, or kidney cancer that's spread to other parts of their body. \n Sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus and bevacizumab aren't currently recommended by NICE. \n Sunitinib \n Sunitinib is the most commonly prescribed treatment for kidney cancer. It\u2019s a type of medication known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinase is an enzyme (protein) that helps cancer cells to grow. Sunitinib works by blocking protein kinase, stopping cancer from growing. \n Sunitinib is taken as a capsule with or without food. You take it once a day for four weeks before having a two-week break. This six-week cycle is repeated for as long as the treatment is effective. \n It\u2019s very important that you take sunitinib in the exact dosage that\u2019s been prescribed for you. Never stop taking medication for cancer without first consulting your specialist. \n Common side effects of sunitinib include: \n \n nausea \n diarrhoea \n  high blood pressure (hypertension)  \n hair discolouration \n mouth soreness \n skin discolouration \n skin rashes or blisters \n \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about  sunitinib and its side effects . \n Pazopanib \n Like sunitinib, pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells in the kidneys.\u00a0It also prevents cancer cells developing blood vessels, which they need to grow. \n Pazopanib is taken as a tablet once a day with a glass of water. You should take it about the same time each day, either at least an hour before eating or two hours afterwards. It\u2019s important that you take it in the exact dosage that your specialist has prescribed for you. \n Common side effects of pazopanib include: \n \n nausea \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n high blood pressure \n hair discolouration \n abnormal liver function\u00a0 \n \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  pazopanib and its side effects . \n Axitinib \n Axitinib may be recommended for treating advanced kidney cancer if sunitinib and/or pazopanib have stopped working or haven\u2019t been effective. \n Like sunitinib and pazopanib, axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tyrosine kinase and stops cancer growing. \n Axitinib is taken as a tablet with a glass of water twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Your specialist may start you on a low dose which, depending on how you feel, may be increased after two weeks. It\u2019s very important that you take the exact dose that\u2019s been prescribed for you. \n Common side effects of axitinib include: \n \n diarrhoea \n nausea and vomiting \n loss of appetite \n tiredness \n a decrease in thyroid hormone level ( hypothyroidism ) \n  headaches  \n weight loss \n loss of fertility \n \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  axitinib and its\u00a0side effects . \n Sorafenib \n Sorafenib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the protein, tyrosine kinase, which encourages cancer cells to grow. It also prevents cancer cells developing blood vessels which they need to grow. \n Sorafenib is taken as tablet twice a day (at the same time each day) with a glass of water. It can also be taken with a meal, but make sure the food is low-fat, because high-fat foods make it less effective. \n Again, it\u2019s very important that you take sorafenib as instructed by your doctor at the exact dosage prescribed for you. \n Common side effects of sorafenib include: \n \n diarrhoea \n fatigue \n nausea and vomiting \n hair thinning (in around one in four people) \n increased risk of bleeding \u2013 such as  nosebleeds  or bleeding gums \n loss of fertility \n flushed skin \n \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  sorafenib and its side effects . \n Temsirolimus \n Temsirolimus is sometimes used to treat advanced kidney cancer. It\u2019s a type of medication known as an mTOR inhibitor, which blocks a protein called mTOR, that\u2019s usually active in cancer cells, making them reproduce and multiply. Temsirolimus also prevents blood vessels developing, which cancer cells need to grow. \n Temsirolimus is a liquid that\u2019s delivered directly into the bloodstream, either through a tube that\u2019s put into a vein in your arm (catheter), or a tube into a large vein in your chest (a central line). The treatment takes 30-60 minutes and you have it once a week in hospital. Before each dose, an antihistamine is usually given to prevent an allergic reaction. \n Common side effects of temsirolimus include: \n \n red, dry, itchy skin \n nausea and vomiting \n lack of appetite \n diarrhoea \n a sore mouth or  mouth ulcers  \n sleeping problems \n loss of fertility \n \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  temsirolimus and its side effects . \n Everolimus \n Everolimus is a medication for advanced kidney cancer that\u2019s returned during or following treatment. It stops some of the signals produced within cells that make them grow and divide. Everolimus prevents the mTOR protein working properly, which plays an important role in the growth of cancer cells. \n Everolimus is taken as a tablet once a day at the same time each day. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, rather than being chewed or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. It\u2019s very important that everolimus is taken using the exact dosage and method prescribed. \n Common side effects of everolimus include: \n \n a sore mouth \n tiredness \n a rash or itchy, dry skin \n loss of appetite \n nausea and vomiting \n a lack of\u00a0periods in women (this may be temporary) \n loss of fertility \n \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  everolimus and its side effects . \n Immunotherapy \n As well as medications that prevent, disrupt and slow down the growth and development of kidney cancer (kinase and mTOR inhibitors), there are also treatments that work by encouraging the immune system to attack cancer cells. This type of treatment is known as immunotherapy. \n Bevacizumab is a medication that\u2019s given intravenously (into a vein, through a drip). It blocks a protein called endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which helps cancer to grow. Bevacizumab is usually used in combination with\u00a0an immunotherapy treatment called interferon. Interferon is taken as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously), three times a week. It encourages your immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells. \n Another medication called aldesleukin is sometimes used to treat kidney cancer that\u2019s spread. It\u2019s similar to a natural protein the body produces called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is part of the immune system. IL-2 activates lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), which fight illnesses and infections. \n Aldesleukin works in a number of ways. It interferes with how cancer cells grow and multiply, it stimulates the immune system into attacking cancer cells, and it makes cancer cells send out chemicals that attract immune system cells. Like interferon, aldesleukin is usually given as a subcutaneous injection. \n Immunotherapy treatments are now rarely used to treat advanced kidney cancer. This is because targeted therapies tend to be more effective in controlling the condition, and immunotherapy can sometimes cause serious side effects. \n The Cancer Research UK website has more information about  treatments for advanced kidney cancer . You can also read more about new treatments that are currently being developed and tested in\u00a0clinical trials in their section about  kidney cancer research (external link) .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "In many cases, kidney cancer is diagnosed after routine scans and check-ups, as the condition doesn't always have obvious symptoms. \n Seeing\u00a0your GP \n You should see a\u00a0GP if you have any symptoms of kidney cancer,\u00a0such as\u00a0blood in your urine or a constant pain below your ribs. \n Your GP will examine you and, if they think your symptoms need further assessment, refer you to a specialist urologist (a doctor who\u00a0specialises in\u00a0conditions that affect the urinary tract). \n If you notice blood in your urine,\u00a0your GP will usually\u00a0carry out a\u00a0 blood test  and take a urine sample. The results will help rule out other\u00a0possible causes, such as infection or  kidney stones . \n In 2015, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of\u00a0renal (kidney) cancer\u00a0and refer people for the right tests faster. To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected\u00a0kidney cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  Suspected Cancer: Recognition and Referral . \n If you need to be referred urgently, you'll usually be seen within two weeks. \n Further tests \n If your GP refers you to a hospital specialist,\u00a0further tests will help\u00a0determine whether you have kidney cancer. \n Ultrasound scan \n An\u00a0 ultrasound scan  uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of an organ in the body. It can often detect changes in the shape of the kidney that might be\u00a0caused by\u00a0a cancerous tumour. \n An ultrasound scan may be needed if the cause of the blood in your urine can't be found. \n Computerised tomography scan \n You may also be referred for a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan . During a CT scan, a series of detailed images of the inside of your body are taken and put together by a computer. \n If you have a CT scan, you may be given a special dye to drink, or it may be injected. The dye makes the results of the CT scan clearer. \n Image-guided biopsy \n In some cases of kidney cancer, an image-guided  biopsy  is carried out. It's a minor surgical procedure performed under  local anaesthetic .\u00a0This means you'll be awake during the procedure, but the\u00a0area surrounding the affected kidney will be numbed, so that you don't feel anything. \n During an image-guided biopsy, a radiologist or surgeon will use an ultrasound or CT scan to guide a needle through your skin and into your kidney. A small tissue sample will be removed from your kidney and examined under a microscope to check for cancerous cells. \n Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \n You may also need to have a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan , which can be used to\u00a0produce detailed images of your kidneys. The images can help identify a tumour and determine\u00a0its size. \n Cystoscopy \n A\u00a0cystoscopy is medical procedure that uses an instrument called a cystoscope to examine the\u00a0inside of your bladder and urinary system. \n This procedure\u00a0doesn't look at\u00a0the kidneys, but it can rule out or confirm whether any bleeding is coming from problems in the bladder. \n Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) \n An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) test involves injecting a dye into your bloodstream.\u00a0 X-rays  are taken after a short time, with the dye highlighting any growths present in the kidneys. \n Staging and grading \n If kidney cancer is confirmed, it's usually possible to determine its grade and stage. \n The stage describes how far the cancer has spread, and the grade describes how aggressive the cancer is and how quickly it's likely to spread. \n Both the stage and grade of your kidney cancer will help determine your recommended treatment and the likelihood of achieving a cure. \n Healthcare professionals use the TNM system\u00a0to stage kidney cancer: \n \n T \u2013 indicates how large the tumour has grown (a tumour is a lump of cancerous tissue) \n N \u2013 indicates whether nearby lymph nodes are affected (lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands found throughout the body, which help protect against infection) \n M \u2013 indicates whether the cancer has spread to another part of the body (M stands for metastases, which is the medical term for cancer that has spread) \n \n The stages of tumour size are: \n \n T1a \u2013 where the tumour is less than 4cm (about 1.6 inches)\u00a0in diameter \n T1b \u2013 where the tumour is 4-7cm (about 1.6-2.8 inches) in diameter \n T2 \u2013 where the tumour is larger than 7cm (2.8 inches)\u00a0in diameter, but hasn't spread out of the kidney \n T3a \u2013 where the tumour has spread into the adrenal gland or the layer of fat surrounding the kidney \n T3b \u2013 where the tumour has spread into the renal vein (the vein that carries blood back from the kidney to the heart) or into the vena cava (the vein that carries blood back from the top half of the body) \n T3c \u2013 where the tumour has spread past the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle that separates the top part of the abdomen from the bottom part) \n T4 \u2013 where the tumour has spread beyond the tough layer of tissue that surrounds and protects the kidney \n \n There are three lymph node stages: \n \n N0 \u2013 where no lymph nodes have been affected \n N1 \u2013 where there are cancer cells in one lymph node \n N2 \u2013 where there are cancer cells in two or more lymph nodes \n \n M0 means that the cancer hasn't spread to another part of the body. M1 means that the cancer has spread. \n Kidney cancer is graded using a scale of one to four. The higher the grade, the more aggressive the cancer. \n Coping with cancer \n Being diagnosed with cancer can be very distressing, particularly if it's incurable. The news can often be difficult to take in and comprehend. \n After cancer has been diagnosed, you may find that talking to a counsellor or psychiatrist helps you deal with\u00a0feelings of  depression  and  anxiety .  Antidepressants  may also be used to help you through this process. \n Read more about  coping with a cancer diagnosis . More information can be found on our pages about\u00a0 living with cancer ."},

It plays an important\u00a0role in helping you breathe and speak. \n In the UK, there are about 2,400 new cases of laryngeal cancer each year. \n The condition is more common in people over the age of 60. It's about four times more common in men than women. \n Symptoms of laryngeal cancer \n The main symptoms of laryngeal cancer include: \n \n a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse \n pain when swallowing\u00a0or\u00a0 difficulty swallowing \u00a0 \n a lump or swelling in your neck \n a\u00a0long-lasting  cough  \n a persistent\u00a0 sore throat  or  earache  \n in severe cases, difficulty breathing \n \n Some people may also experience\u00a0bad breath,  breathlessness , a high-pitched wheezing noise\u00a0when\u00a0breathing, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue (extreme tiredness). \n When to see your GP \n You should visit your GP if you have had\u00a0any of the main symptoms listed above for more than three weeks. \n These symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as  laryngitis , but it's a good idea to get them checked out. \n If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer. \n Read more about  diagnosing laryngeal cancer . \n What causes laryngeal cancer? \n It's not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by: \n \n smoking tobacco \n regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol \n having a family history of head and neck cancer \n having an unhealthy diet \n exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust \n \n By adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of laryngeal cancer \u00a0and  preventing laryngeal cancer . \n How laryngeal cancer is treated \n The main treatments for laryngeal cancer\u00a0are  radiotherapy , surgery and  chemotherapy . \n Radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it's diagnosed early. \n If the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used. \n If you have surgery to remove your larynx, you'll no longer\u00a0be able to speak or breathe in the usual way. Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and you will need additional treatment to help restore your voice. \n This may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device\u00a0you hold against your throat to produce sound. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating laryngeal cancer \u00a0and  recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery . \n Outlook \n The outlook for laryngeal cancer depends on the extent of the cancer when it's diagnosed and treated. \n Fortunately,\u00a0most laryngeal cancers are diagnosed at an early stage, which means the outlook is generally better than some other types of cancer. \n Overall,\u00a0about 70 out of every 100 people will live for at least 5 years after diagnosis and\u00a0about\u00a060 out of every 100 people will live for at least 10 years. \n If you smoke,\u00a0 stopping smoking  after being diagnosed with laryngeal cancer may improve your outlook.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Laryngeal cancer is caused by changes in the cells of the larynx, although it's not clear exactly why this happens. \n All cancers begin with a change in\u00a0a cell's\u00a0DNA.\u00a0DNA provides our cells with a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. \n A change in\u00a0DNA can alter the instructions that control cell growth, which means cells continue to grow instead of stopping when they should. This causes the cells to reproduce in an uncontrollable manner, producing a growth of tissue called a tumour. \n It's not known why the DNA inside the cells of the larynx is affected in cases of laryngeal cancer. But it appears that exposure to\u00a0things that can damage the cells and tissue of the larynx increases the risk of cancer developing. \n What can increase your risk? \n A\u00a0number of things can increase your chances of developing laryngeal cancer. \n Alcohol and tobacco \n Alcohol and tobacco are the two main things that can increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. They're\u00a0thought to contain chemicals that can damage the cells of the larynx. \n The\u00a0more you drink or smoke, the higher your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. \n People who smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, or people who have smoked for more than 40 years, have been found to be about 40 times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer than\u00a0people who don't smoke. \n Compared to people who don't drink, people who regularly drink large amounts of alcohol are about three times more likely to develop laryngeal cancer. \n If you drink and smoke, your risk of laryngeal cancer increases even further. By stopping both drinking and smoking, you can significantly reduce your risk of developing the condition.

It's thought the virus may have a similar effect on the cells of the throat. HPV is often spread during sex, including oral sex. \n Exposure to harmful\u00a0substances \n Having a job where you're exposed to high levels of certain substances may also increase your risk of developing laryngeal cancer. These include: \n \n asbestos \n coal or wood dust \n paint or diesel fumes \n nickel \n sulphuric acid fumes \n formaldehyde (a chemical\u00a0used in a wide range of industrial processes, such as paint manufacturing and cosmetics) \n isopropyl alcohol (often used as a cleaning solvent)", "treatment": "The treatment for laryngeal cancer largely depends on the size of the cancer. The main treatments are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy. \n Most hospitals use multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) of specialists that work together to decide\u00a0the best way to proceed with your treatment. \n Members of your MDT will probably include a surgeon, a clinical oncologist (a specialist in non-surgical treatment of cancer), and a specialist cancer nurse who will be responsible for co-ordinating your care. \n Your cancer team will recommend what they think is the best treatment option, but the final decision will be yours. \n Before visiting hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions you'd like to ask\u00a0your care team. For example, you may want to find out the advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments. \n Your treatment plan \n Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the stage of the\u00a0cancer (see  diagnosing laryngeal cancer  for more information on staging). \n If you have early-stage laryngeal cancer, it may be possible to remove the cancer using surgery (endoscopic resection) or\u00a0 radiotherapy  alone. This may also be the case with slightly larger cancers, although a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is sometimes required. \n In later-stage laryngeal cancer, more extensive surgery may be needed. Radiotherapy and  chemotherapy  will probably be used in combination. In some cases, the entire larynx may have to be removed. \n A medication called cetuximab may be used in cases where chemotherapy is not suitable. \n These treatments are described below. \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy uses controlled doses of high-energy radiation to destroy cancerous cells. It can be used as a treatment on its own for early-stage laryngeal cancer, or it can be used\u00a0after surgery to stop cancerous cells returning. It's sometimes combined with chemotherapy. \n The energy beams used during radiotherapy have to be precisely targeted to your larynx.\u00a0To ensure\u00a0the beams are directed at the exact area, a special plastic mask will be made to hold your head in the right position. A mould of your face will be taken, so that the mask can be made before treatment starts. \n Radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions from Monday to Friday, with a break from treatment at the weekend. The course of treatment usually lasts for three to seven weeks. \n As well as killing cancerous cells, radiotherapy can affect healthy tissue and has a number of side effects, including: \n \n sore, red skin (similar to  sunburn ) \n  mouth ulcers  \n  dry mouth  \n loss of taste \n loss of appetite \n tiredness \n feeling sick \n \n Your MDT will monitor any side effects and treat them when possible. For example, protective gels can be used to treat mouth ulcers, and medicines are available for a dry mouth. \n Radiotherapy can sometimes cause your throat tissue to become inflamed. Severe inflammation can cause breathing difficulties. Contact your key worker or visit\u00a0 your local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department  as soon as possible if you have difficulty breathing. \n Most side effects should pass within a few weeks of treatment finishing. \n Read more about\u00a0 radiotherapy . \n Surgery \n There are three\u00a0types of surgery that\u00a0can be used to treat laryngeal cancer. They are: \n \n endoscopic resection \n partial laryngectomy \n total laryngectomy \n \n These are described below. \n Endoscopic resection \n Endoscopic resection can be used\u00a0in\u00a0early-stage laryngeal cancer. \n During the procedure, a surgeon uses a special microscope to get a magnified view of the larynx. This allows them to remove the cancer either with a laser or small surgical instruments. \n An endoscopic resection is carried out under  general anaesthetic , so you will\u00a0be unconscious during the procedure and won't feel any pain. \n Your\u00a0mouth and throat\u00a0may feel sore for a few weeks after the operation and there's a risk of your voice changing as a result of the procedure, which can be permanent. \n Partial laryngectomy \n A partial laryngectomy can be used to treat some laryngeal cancers. The operation involves surgically removing the affected part of your larynx. Some of your vocal cords will be left in place, so you will still be able to talk, but your voice may be quite hoarse or weak. \n While your larynx is healing, you may find breathing difficult. Your surgeon\u00a0may need to\u00a0create a temporary hole in your neck, which will be attached to a tube you can breathe through. This is known as a temporary tracheostomy. \n Once your larynx has healed, the tube can be removed and the hole will heal, leaving a small scar. \n This operation is\u00a0uncommon nowadays,\u00a0as endoscopic resection is preferred whenever possible. \n Total laryngectomy \n A total laryngectomy is usually used to treat advanced laryngeal cancer. The operation involves removing your entire larynx. Nearby lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) may also need to be removed if the cancer has spread to them. \n As your vocal cords will be removed, you won't be able to speak in the usual way after the operation. However, there are several ways to help restore your speech. \n If you have a total laryngectomy, your surgeon will also need to create a permanent hole in your neck (called a stoma) to help you breath after the operation. \n You will be given training on how to keep your stoma clean. Having a stoma can seem daunting and frightening at first, but most people get used to it after a few months. \n See  recovering from laryngeal cancer  for more information about speaking after surgery and looking after a stoma. \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy uses powerful cancer-killing medicines to damage the DNA of the cancerous cells and stop them reproducing. It may be used to\u00a0shrink a tumour before surgery or radiotherapy, or in combination with radiotherapy to make the radiotherapy more effective. \n It can also be used to\u00a0treat laryngeal cancer that's advanced or has come back after treatment. In this situation, it can relieve symptoms and may slow the cancer's growth. \n Chemotherapy medication is usually given as an injection into a vein (intravenously) once every three or four weeks, for up to six months. You may need to stay in hospital for a few days\u00a0during each treatment or you may just come in for a short visit each time. \n Chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as the cancerous tissue. This, unfortunately, means side effects are common, such as: \n \n feeling and being sick \n hair loss \n loss of appetite \n  diarrhoea  \n sore mouth and mouth ulcers \n tiredness \n \n Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection and illness. \n It's therefore important to report any symptoms of a potential infection to your\u00a0MDT, such as a high temperature, chills or a persistent cough. You should also avoid close contact with people\u00a0known to have an infection. \n The\u00a0side effects of chemotherapy should improve after your treatment has finished. \n Read more about\u00a0 chemotherapy . \n Cetuximab \n Cetuximab is a type of medication called a biological therapy. These medications target and disrupt the processes that cancerous cells use to grow and reproduce. \n Cetuximab can be used in combination with radiotherapy to treat more advanced laryngeal cancer, when it's not possible to use chemotherapy. For example, people with kidney or heart disease, or people with an ongoing infection, may not be able to have chemotherapy, because it could make them very ill. \n Cetuximab is given slowly\u00a0through a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to an hour or more. It's usually given weekly for\u00a0up to seven\u00a0weeks. \n Side effects of cetuximab are usually mild and include: \n \n rashes \n feeling sick \n  diarrhoea  \n  breathlessness  \n \n Cetuximab can also trigger allergic reactions in some people, which can cause problems such as a swollen tongue or throat. In a few cases,\u00a0the reaction can be severe and potentially life-threatening. \n Most serious reactions occur within a day of treatment starting, so you'll be closely monitored once your treatment begins. If you have symptoms of a severe\u00a0reaction, such as a rapid heartbeat or breathing problems, medication can be used to relieve them (such as  corticosteroids ).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have symptoms of laryngeal cancer, such as a hoarse voice and pain when swallowing, your GP will ask about your symptoms and recent medical history. \n They may also examine the inside and outside of your throat for abnormalities, such as lumps and swellings. \n If laryngeal cancer is suspected, you'll probably be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your local hospital for further testing. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that\u00a0anyone aged 45\u00a0or over with persistent unexplained hoarseness or an unexplained lump in their neck should have an appointment with a specialist within two weeks. \n The main tests that may be carried out in hospital are described below. \n Nasendoscopy \n A nasendoscopy is a procedure used to get a clear view of your larynx. \n During the procedure, a small, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end (endoscope) is\u00a0inserted into one of your nostrils and passed down the back of your throat. The images from the endoscope are displayed on a monitor. \n You'll usually be awake while this is carried out and it may feel uncomfortable.\u00a0A\u00a0 local anaesthetic  spray is\u00a0sometimes used to numb your nose and throat beforehand, so you don't feel any pain. \n Laryngoscopy \n If it wasn't possible to get a good view of your larynx during a nasendoscopy, or a possible problem is spotted, you may have a further test called a laryngoscopy. \n Like a nasendoscopy, this procedure involves using an endoscope to examine your larynx. However, the endoscope used during a laryngoscopy is longer and inserted through the mouth. This allows the larynx to be seen in greater detail. \n A laryngoscopy\u00a0can be very uncomfortable, so it's usually carried out under\u00a0 general anaesthetic  (where you're asleep). You should be able to leave hospital as soon as you've recovered from the effects of anaesthetic, which is usually the same day or the day after. \n Biopsy \n During a\u00a0nasendoscopy or\u00a0laryngoscopy, your doctor may use small instruments to remove a sample of cells from your larynx so it can be examined for signs of cancer. This is known as a\u00a0 biopsy . \n Alternatively, if you have a lump in your neck, a needle and syringe can be used to\u00a0remove a tissue sample. This is known as fine needle aspiration. \n Further testing \n If the results of the biopsy show you have cancer and there's a risk it may have spread, you'll probably be referred for further testing to assess how widespread the cancer is. The tests may include: \n \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \u2013 a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed three-dimensional picture of your larynx and the surrounding tissue \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013\u00a0a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce a more detailed image of your larynx and the surrounding tissue \n a  PET-CT scan \u00a0\u2013 a CT scan is used to take pictures of the inside of your body after you've been injected with\u00a0a mildly radioactive substance that helps to show cancerous areas more clearly \n an  ultrasound scan \u00a0\u2013\u00a0high-frequency sound waves are used to check for signs of cancer in the lymph nodes (glands found throughout the body) near the larynx \n \n Staging and grading \n After these tests have been completed, your doctor should be able to tell you the extent of the cancer. This is known as the stage and grade of the cancer. \n Healthcare professionals use a system called the TNM system to stage laryngeal cancer. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. \n \n The T stage is given as a number from 1-4 \u2013 Small tumours confined to one part of the larynx are described as T1 tumours and large tumours that have grown into tissues outside the larynx are described as T4. \n The N stage is given as a number from 0-3 \u2013 N0 means the lymph nodes are not affected, whereas stages N2 to N3 mean that one or more lymph nodes are affected. \n The M stage is given as either M0 or M1 \u2013 M0 means the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body and M1 means that it has. \n \n There are also three different grades\u00a0(1-3) used to describe\u00a0laryngeal cancer. Lower-grade cancers, such as grade 1, tend to grow more slowly and are less likely to spread.\u00a0Higher-grade cancers, such as grade 3,\u00a0grow quickly and\u00a0are more likely to spread. \n You can read more about the\u00a0 stages and grades of laryngeal cancer  on the Cancer Research UK website."},

You should visit\u00a0your GP if the skin around your anus changes or feels painful. \n If the cause of your itchy bottom can't be identified and treated, it may last for long periods of time (known as chronic itchy bottom). This may cause you\u00a0to feel embarrassed, anxious or depressed. \n As the urge to scratch is often worse at night, your sleep\u00a0may also be disturbed, leaving you feeling tired during the day. \n Speak to your GP if your itchy bottom is making you anxious or depressed, or if it's significantly affecting your sleep.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "The cause of itchy bottom isn't always known. However, it can sometimes be a symptom of another problem or underlying condition. \n Infection \n An itchy bottom may be a sign\u00a0that your body is trying to deal with an infection. The infection may be: \n \n bacterial \u2013 such as the streptococcal bacteria that causes streptococcal infections, or the staphylococcal bacteria that causes staphylococcal infections \n fungal \u2013 such as the Candida albicans fungus that causes\u00a0 vaginal thrush \u00a0(itching, irritation and swelling of the vagina and surrounding area) \n parasitic \u2013 such as\u00a0 threadworms  (small worm parasites that infect the intestines), or\u00a0 scabies  (tiny mites that burrow into the skin) \n viral \u2013 such as the herpes simplex virus, which causes  cold sores  \n \n An itchy bottom can sometimes\u00a0be a symptom of a  sexually transmitted infection (STI) . \n If you've had unprotected sex and think you could have an STI, visit  your local\u00a0sexual health clinic . They\u00a0can offer advice and provide testing\u00a0and treatment. \n Gastrointestinal conditions \n Gastrointestinal conditions affect your digestive tract (your mouth, throat, stomach, intestines and anus). \n Gastrointestinal conditions that may cause an itchy bottom include: \n \n  haemorrhoids (piles)  \u2013 swellings in and around your anus\u00a0that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels \n anal fistula \u2013 where a small channel (tract) develops between your anal canal (the last section of the large intestine) and the surface of your skin, near the anus \n anal fissure \u2013 a tear or ulcer (open sore) that develops in the lining of the anal canal \n sphincter incompetence \u2013 where the sphincter (the ring of muscle that opens and closes your anus) stops working properly, causing\u00a0 bowel incontinence  \n long-term\u00a0 diarrhoea  \u2013 passing loose, watery stools \n long-term\u00a0 constipation  \u2013 an inability to completely empty your bowels \n \n Skin conditions \n Some skin conditions can affect any area of skin on your\u00a0body, including the skin around your anus. \n Skin conditions that can be associated with an itchy bottom include: \n \n  psoriasis  \u2013 where red, flaky, crusty patches of skin develop\u00a0because your skin cells reproduce too quickly \n contact dermatitis \u2013 where your skin reacts to certain substances (allergens), causing it to become inflamed \n lichen\u00a0sclerosus \u2013 a long-term skin disorder that causes itchy or sore white spots to develop on the skin around the genitals \n atopic eczema \u2013 where your skin becomes dry, red and flaky \n \n Systemic conditions \n Systemic conditions affect your whole body and can sometimes make your bottom feel itchy. Systemic conditions include: \n \n  diabetes  \u2013 a lifelong condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high \n  kidney failure  \u2013 where your kidneys stop working properly \n iron deficiency anaemia \u2013 a decrease in the number of red, oxygen-carrying blood cells, causing tiredness and a lack of energy (lethargy)\u00a0 \n  overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)  \u2013 too much thyroid hormone in your body \n \n Medication \n Some types of medication, including those applied directly to your skin (topical),\u00a0may make your bottom feel itchy. \n For example, if you use a cream to treat haemorrhoids,\u00a0it may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus and make the itching worse. \n Some topical medicines may\u00a0also cause contact dermatitis\u00a0(red, itchy skin) if used for long periods. \n Medicines that may\u00a0cause an itchy bottom or make your symptoms worse include: \n \n peppermint oil \u2013 which is sometimes used to help relieve stomach\u00a0cramps \n long-term use of\u00a0 local anaesthetics  \u2013 medicines that numb a specific part of your body \n glyceryl trinitrate \u2013 which\u00a0is often prescribed as a topical cream to treat anal fissures, and may cause\u00a0 itching \u00a0 \n long-term use of  topical corticosteroids  \u2013 medicines applied directly to the skin to help reduce inflammation \n \n If a medicine you're taking is causing an itchy bottom, your bottom should itch\u00a0less after you've completed the\u00a0course of medication. \n Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your GP or other qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. \n Speak to your GP if you're taking a medicine on a long-term basis and it's causing an itchy bottom.

If necessary, medication may be prescribed to help ease the symptoms. \n Self-care for itchy bottom \n If you still have an itchy bottom\u00a0after 2\u00a0months, or if it returns, you may need to follow this self-care\u00a0advice for longer. \n Keeping clean and dry \n If you have an\u00a0itchy bottom, you should keep your bottom as clean and dry as possible. \n The best way to do this is to\u00a0use water to gently clean your anus and the surrounding skin. Clean your bottom in\u00a0this way after every bowel movement\u00a0and before going to bed each night. \n You can\u00a0use soap to clean your bottom, but make sure it's mild and\u00a0unperfumed so\u00a0it causes less irritation to your skin. Wash all of the soap away afterwards. \n After washing, gently\u00a0dry your bottom. Avoid rubbing the area vigorously, as this may irritate your\u00a0skin. Instead, gently pat the skin dry using a soft towel. You can also dry your bottom\u00a0using a hairdryer on a low heat setting. \n When you're away from home, you can use damp toilet paper\u00a0after passing stools, before gently patting your bottom dry. \n If you\u00a0have a tendency to\u00a0sweat, or if\u00a0your bottom becomes very moist, putting a cotton tissue in your underwear will\u00a0help\u00a0absorb the moisture around your anal area. \n Other self-care measures \n As well as keeping your bottom clean and dry, there are a number of other self-care measures you can undertake. For example, you should: \n \n use soft toilet tissue \n bath or shower daily \n wear loose-fitting cotton underwear and change it daily \n only put underwear on when your bottom is completely dry \n avoid wearing tight clothing; women should wear stockings instead of tights \n use a light duvet at night so\u00a0you don't get too hot \n avoid using scented soaps, bubble bath, perfumes or powders around your anus \n keep your fingernails short to try to keep your skin being damaged from scratching \n wear cotton gloves while sleeping so that you cause less damage to your skin if you scratch \n \n It may be difficult, but you should try to resist the urge to\u00a0scratch your bottom, as scratching will only make the problem worse. \n Diet \n Some\u00a0foods may\u00a0make your itchy bottom worse. If\u00a0the urge to scratch your bottom is greater after eating certain foods, try cutting them out of your diet completely or reducing the amount you eat. \n Foods that may make your itchy bottom worse include: \n \n tomatoes \n spicy foods \n citrus fruits, such as oranges \n nuts \n chocolate \n dairy products \n coffee \n excessive amounts of liquids, such as milk, beer or wine\u00a0 \n \n Fibre \n Your GP may recommend that you follow a diet that keeps your stools regular and well-formed.\u00a0 \n This means\u00a0your stools\u00a0won't be loose (runny), but you won't need to strain when you go to the toilet. \n Loose stools can irritate\u00a0your anus. Straining to pass\u00a0hard stools may cause  haemorrhoids (piles) \u00a0to develop. Piles are swellings\u00a0that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in and around your anus. \n Including more fibre in your diet will make your stools softer and easier to pass. Fibre can be\u00a0found in: \n \n grains \u2013 such as wholegrain bread \n pulses \u2013 edible seeds that grow in a pod, such as peas, beans and lentils \n oats \u2013 which are in some breakfast cereals \n fruit and vegetables \n \n Medication \n While waiting for the above self-care measures to take effect, your GP may prescribe medication to help ease your itchy bottom. \n However, you shouldn't use\u00a0topical treatments (those applied directly\u00a0to your skin)\u00a0for more\u00a0than 2\u00a0weeks, because they may start to harm your skin if used for long periods. \n Soothing ointments \n Your GP may prescribe an ointment or cream to soothe the skin around your anus. You'll usually have to apply it in the\u00a0morning and\u00a0at night, as well as\u00a0after each\u00a0bowel movement. \n Topical corticosteroids \n If the skin around your anus is\u00a0sore and inflamed due to  itching , your GP may prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid (an ointment that contains steroids). Applying this directly to the affected area will help relieve the inflammation and ease the urge to scratch. \n In most cases, using a \u00a0topical corticosteroid  will help ease the itch. However, it can sometimes make the\u00a0itching worse. Speak to your GP immediately if your itchy bottom gets worse after using topical corticosteroids. \n Antihistamines \n If your sleep is disturbed due\u00a0to\u00a0itching at night, using an antihistamine may help. \n Antihistamines\u00a0are medicines that work by counteracting the action of histamine (a chemical released during an allergic reaction). Some antihistamines also have a sedating effect (they make you drowsy). \n Your GP\u00a0may prescribe\u00a0chlorphenamine or hydroxyzine. These should be taken at night and shouldn't be used for longer than 2\u00a0weeks, because after this time the sedating effect may no longer work. \n You need to be aware that sedating antihistamines can affect your ability to drive or operate machinery, and\u00a0the sedating effect may be stronger if you drink  alcohol . \n Treating an underlying cause \n When diagnosing itchy bottom,\u00a0your GP will try to determine an underlying cause. \n If they identify the cause, such as a bacterial infection or skin condition, it\u00a0will also need to be treated\u00a0for your itchy bottom to be properly managed. \n For example, a bacterial infection may need to be treated with  antibiotics . If the underlying cause is left untreated, your itchy bottom may return. \n An itchy bottom\u00a0in children is often caused by worms. If treatment for worms is recommended, other family members with the same symptom should also be treated. \n Further treatment \n Go back to your GP if your itchy bottom doesn't improve after\u00a0following self-care measures, such as keeping your bottom clean and dry, and using medication to provide relief from the itching. \n Your GP may then refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) or a colorectal surgeon (who specialises in conditions that affect the large intestine and anus).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It could be a symptom of a more serious condition. \n Your GP will ask you about your symptoms\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have noticed whether anything makes your itch worse, or if your itch comes and goes. They will also examine your skin to look for any visible symptoms. \n In some cases, they may take a skin scraping or a swab so it can be tested to help identify the cause of your itching.\u00a0A  blood test \u00a0may also be carried out to look for underlying problems, such as thyroid or kidney disease. \n Depending on what is found to be causing your itch, you may be referred to a\u00a0hospital specialist for a further assessment and specific treatment.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "An itch is often caused by a condition affecting the skin, but it can be a sign of a more serious underlying problem. \n In some cases, it may not be possible to identify a specific cause. \n Skin conditions \n Skin conditions that can cause itching include: \n \n dry skin \n  eczema \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where the skin is dry, red, flaky and itchy \n contact dermatitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation of the skin that occurs when you come into contact with an irritant or allergen (see below) \n  urticaria  \u2013\u00a0also known as hives, welts or nettle rash; urticaria is triggered by an allergen and causes a raised, red itchy rash to develop \n  lichen planus \u00a0\u2013\u00a0an itchy rash of unknown cause \n  psoriasis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a\u00a0skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales \n dandruff\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0a common skin condition that causes dry white or grey flakes of dead skin to appear in the scalp or hair \n folliculitis \u2013\u00a0a skin condition\u00a0caused by inflamed hair follicles \n prurigo \u2013\u00a0small blisters (fluid-filled swellings) that are very itchy\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Allergies and skin reactions \n Itching is sometimes\u00a0caused by an allergen, irritant or other environmental factor, including: \n \n cosmetic ingredients, such as preservatives, fragrances, hair dye and nail varnish hardeners \n certain metals, such as nickel or cobalt in jewellery \n rubber \u2013 including latex \n textiles \u2013 particularly the dyes and resins that are contained in them \n some plants \u2013 such as chrysanthemums, sunflowers, daffodils, tulips and primula \n an\u00a0 allergy  to certain foods or types of medication (for example,\u00a0 aspirin  and a group of medicines called opioids) \n prickly heat\u00a0\u2013\u00a0an itchy rash that appears in hot, humid weather conditions \n  sunburn \u00a0\u2013\u00a0skin damage\u00a0caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays \n \n Parasites and insects \n Itching can be caused by the following pests: \n \n the scabies mite, which burrows into the skin and causes a skin condition called  scabies  \n  head lice ,\u00a0 pubic lice  or body lice \n  insect bites and stings \u00a0from bees, wasps, mosquitoes, fleas and\u00a0bedbugs \n  threadworms  \u2013 small worm parasites that infect the bowels of humans and can cause an\u00a0 itchy bottom  \n trichomonas vaginalis \u2013\u00a0a tiny parasite\u00a0that causes\u00a0a\u00a0 sexually transmitted infection (STI)  called\u00a0trichomoniasis \n \n Infections \n Itching may be a symptom of an infection, such as: \n \n  chickenpox \u00a0or another viral infection \n athlete's foot\u00a0\u2013 a fungal infection that causes itching in between the toes \n  ringworm \u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0fungal infection that causes a ring-like red rash to develop on the\u00a0skin and can cause an itchy scalp \n  vaginal thrush \u00a0or  thrush in men \u00a0\u2013 yeast infections that\u00a0can cause itching in and around the genitals \n \n Other\u00a0conditions \n Itching can be a sign of an underlying condition that may affect the inside of\u00a0the body without necessarily causing any other obvious symptoms. \n Itching can be a symptom of: \n \n  haemorrhoids (piles)  \u2013 enlarged and swollen blood vessels in or around the lower rectum or anus \n an\u00a0 overactive thyroid  or\u00a0underactive thyroid \u2013 where the thyroid gland in the neck produces too\u00a0much or too little thyroid hormone \n iron deficiency anaemia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells \n polycythaemia\u00a0\u2013 where\u00a0you have a high concentration of red blood cells in your blood \n liver-related conditions, such as  primary biliary cirrhosis  and  hepatitis  \n long standing kidney failure \n in rare cases, certain types of cancer, including\u00a0 liver cancer ,  pancreatic cancer ,  leukaemia \u00a0and  Hodgkin lymphoma  \n \n Occasionally, itching can be linked to a psychological condition\u00a0such as\u00a0 depression  or anxiety. \n Pregnancy and the menopause \n In women, itching can sometimes be caused by hormonal changes during pregnancy and after the  menopause . \n Pregnancy \n Itching often affects pregnant women and usually disappears after the birth.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Irritable hip", "introduction": "Irritable hip is a common childhood condition that causes symptoms such as hip pain and limping. \n Doctors sometimes refer to irritable\u00a0hip\u00a0as transient or toxic synovitis. \n Hip pain isn't usually severe, but\u00a0your child may be reluctant to place weight on the affected leg. \n Occasionally, an irritable hip may also cause: \n \n pain in the knee or thigh \n restricted movement in one of\u00a0the hip joints \n a slightly higher temperature than normal\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a normal temperature is around 37C (98.6F) \n \n In younger children who are unable to speak, the only noticeable symptom may be\u00a0crying at night. \n When to see your GP \n Although irritable hip is usually a mild condition, you should take your child to see\u00a0your GP if you are concerned about their hips,\u00a0so that a diagnosis can be confirmed. \n This is because irritable hip shares symptoms of more serious hip conditions, such as\u00a0septic arthritis\u00a0(an infection inside the hip) or Perthes disease. \n Your GP will examine their hip and may recommend further tests to rule out other causes. These tests include: \n \n an\u00a0 X-ray  to see if there's a problem with your child's bones \n  blood tests \u00a0to look for a bone or joint infection \n an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  that will highlight any fluid that may be on the joint \n \n If there's fluid on the joint, a sample can be removed and checked for an infection. Just removing the fluid from the joint can ease the symptoms. \n What causes irritable hip? \n The condition\u00a0develops when the lining that covers the hip joint (the synovial membrane) becomes irritated and inflamed, although the cause of inflammation is unclear. \n Some cases of irritable hip occur\u00a0following a viral infection in the chest, throat or digestive system. Many experts think the synovial membrane in the hip becomes inflamed as a complication of the infection. However, there is no hard evidence to support this theory. \n Another theory is that a hip injury may cause the swelling, although many cases develop in children who do not have a history of injury. \n Who is affected? \n Irritable hip can affect boys and girls of any age, but is most common between the age of four and\u00a010 years old. The condition affects twice as many boys than girls. \n Is it serious? \n As a parent, it can be very worrying if your child is diagnosed with irritable hip and is struggling to walk. However, the condition is usually short-lived. \n Most cases don't require specific treatment, because the pain usually passes within two weeks. \n A small number of children with irritable hip go on to have further episodes. However, these episodes usually become less frequent and\u00a0eventually stop when the child is older. \n Recovery \n Ibuprofen, which is available over the counter, can be used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.\u00a0Your child\u00a0should also rest the affected leg until symptoms have passed. \n Massaging the affected hip and applying heat may also help to reduce your child's hip pain. \n It usually takes a couple of weeks to recover from irritable hip, although your GP may recommend that your child does not play sport or take part in any strenuous activities for at least another two weeks following treatment. This is to reduce the chances of irritable hip returning. \n Swimming is a good way to strengthen the joint and get it moving again. \n A follow-up appointment may be needed up to six months later. This is to rule out other hip conditions that can also cause pain, stiffness and a limp.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)", "introduction": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, long-term condition of the digestive system. It can cause bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and/or constipation. \n IBS is thought to affect up to 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0people at some point in their life, and it usually first develops when a person is between 20 and 30 years of age. Around twice as many women are affected as men. \n The condition is often lifelong, although it may improve over several years. \n IBS symptoms \n The symptoms of IBS\u00a0vary between individuals and affect some people more severely than others. They tend to come and go in periods lasting a few days to a few months at a time, often during times of stress or after eating certain foods. \n You may find some of the symptoms of IBS ease after going to the toilet and opening your bowels. \n Read more about  the symptoms of IBS  \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you think you have IBS symptoms, so they can try to\u00a0determine the cause. \n Your GP may be able to identify IBS based on your symptoms, although  blood tests  may be needed to rule out other conditions. \n Read more about  diagnosing IBS  \n What causes IBS? \n The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but most experts think that it's related to increased sensitivity of the gut and problems digesting food. \n These problems may mean that you're more sensitive to pain coming from your gut, and you may become constipated or have diarrhoea because your food\u00a0passes through your gut either too\u00a0slowly or too quickly. \n Psychological factors such as stress\u00a0may also play a part in IBS. \n Read more about  the causes of IBS  \n How is IBS treated? \n There is no cure for IBS, but the symptoms can often be managed by making changes to\u00a0your diet and lifestyle. \n For example, it may help to: \n \n identify and avoid foods or drinks\u00a0that trigger your symptoms \n alter the amount of fibre in your diet \n exercise regularly \n reduce your stress levels \n \n Medication\u00a0is\u00a0sometimes prescribed for people with IBS to treat the\u00a0individual symptoms they experience. \n Read more about  treating IBS  \n Living with IBS \n IBS is unpredictable. You may go for many months without any symptoms, then have a sudden flare-up. \n The condition\u00a0can also be painful and debilitating, which can have a negative impact on your quality of life and emotional state. Many people with IBS will experience feelings of  depression \u00a0and  anxiety , at some point.\u00a0 \n Speak to your GP if you have feelings of depression or anxiety that are\u00a0affecting your daily life. These problems rarely improve without treatment and your GP can recommend treatments such as  antidepressants  or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which can help you cope with IBS, as well as directly treating the condition. \n With appropriate medical and psychological treatment, you should be able to live a normal, full and active life with IBS.\u00a0 \n IBS does not pose a serious threat to your physical health and doesn't increase your chances of developing cancer\u00a0or other bowel-related conditions.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of IBS are usually worse after eating and tend to come and go in episodes. \n Most people have\u00a0flare-ups of symptoms that last\u00a0a few days. After this time, the symptoms usually improve, but may not disappear completely. \n In some people, the symptoms seem to be triggered by something they have had to eat or drink.\u00a0 \n Read more about  IBS triggers  \n Main symptoms \n The most common symptoms of IBS are: \n \n  abdominal (stomach) pain \u00a0and cramping, which may be\u00a0relieved by having a poo \n a change in your bowel habits \u2013 such as  diarrhoea ,\u00a0 constipation \u00a0or sometimes both \n bloating and swelling of your stomach \n excessive wind ( flatulence ) \n occasionally experiencing an urgent need to go to the toilet \n a feeling that you haven't fully emptied your bowels after\u00a0going to the toilet\u00a0 \n passing mucus from your\u00a0bottom\u00a0 \n \n Additional problems \n In addition to the main symptoms, some people with IBS experience a number of other problems. These can include: \n \n a lack of energy (lethargy) \n feeling sick \n backache \n bladder problems - such as needing to wake up\u00a0to urinate at night,\u00a0experiencing an urgent need to urinate and difficulty fully emptying the bladder \n pain during sex (dyspareunia) \n  incontinence  \n \n The symptoms of IBS can also have a significant impact on a person's day-to-day life and can have a deep psychological impact. As a result, many people with the condition have feelings of  depression  and  anxiety . \n When to see your GP \n You should see your GP if: \n \n you think you have IBS symptoms, so they can try to identify the cause - they can often do this by asking about your symptoms, although further tests are occasionally needed to rule out other conditions \n you're feeling anxious or depressed - these problems rarely improve without treatment and could make your IBS symptoms worse \n \n  You should see your GP immediately i f you have other symptoms, including: \n \n unexplained weight loss \n a swelling or lump in your stomach or bottom \n bleeding from your bottom \n  signs of anaemia  \n \n These can sometimes be a sign of a potentially more serious condition. \n Read more about  diagnosing IBS", "causes": "The exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown, but most experts think that it's related to problems with digestion and increased sensitivity of the gut. \n Many causes have been suggested \u2013 including inflammation, infections and certain diets \u2013 but none\u00a0have been proven to directly lead to IBS. \n Problems with digestion \n Your\u00a0body\u00a0usually moves food through your digestive system by\u00a0squeezing and relaxing the muscles of the intestines\u00a0in a rhythmic way. \n However, in IBS it's\u00a0thought that this process\u00a0is altered,\u00a0resulting in\u00a0food moving through\u00a0your digestive system either too quickly or too slowly. \n If food\u00a0moves through your digestive system\u00a0too quickly it causes\u00a0 diarrhoea , because\u00a0your digestive system does not have enough time to absorb water from the food. \n If food moves through your digestive system\u00a0too slowly it causes\u00a0 constipation ,\u00a0as too much water is absorbed, making your\u00a0stools hard and difficult to pass. \n It may be\u00a0that\u00a0food does not\u00a0pass through the digestive systems of people with IBS properly because the signals that travel back and forth from the brain to the gut are disrupted in some way. \n It has also been suggested that problems such as bile acid malabsorption (where bile produced by the liver builds up in the digestive system) may be responsible for some cases of IBS. \n Increased gut sensitivity \n Many sensations in the body\u00a0come from your digestive system. For example, nerves in your digestive system relay signals to your brain to let you know if you are hungry or full, or if you need to go to the toilet. \n Some experts think\u00a0that\u00a0people with IBS may be oversensitive to the digestive nerve signals. This means mild\u00a0 indigestion \u00a0that is barely noticeable in most people becomes distressing  abdominal (stomach) pain  in those with IBS. \n Psychological factors \n There is\u00a0also some evidence to suggest that psychological factors play an important role in IBS. \n However, this does not mean that IBS is \"all in the mind\", because\u00a0symptoms are very real. Intense emotional states such as stress and anxiety can trigger chemical changes that interfere with the normal workings of the digestive system. \n This does not just happen in people with IBS. Many people who\u00a0have never had\u00a0IBS before can have a sudden change in bowel habits when faced with a stressful situation, such as an important exam or job interview. \n Some people with IBS have experienced a traumatic event, usually during their childhood, such as abuse, neglect, a serious childhood illness or bereavement. \n It is possible that these types of difficult experiences in your past may\u00a0make you more sensitive to stress and the symptoms of pain and discomfort. \n IBS triggers \n Certain foods and drinks can trigger the\u00a0 symptoms of\u00a0IBS . Triggers vary from person to person, but common ones include: \n \n alcohol \n fizzy drinks \n chocolate \n drinks that contain caffeine \u2013 such as tea, coffee or cola \n processed snacks \u2013 such as crisps and biscuits \n fatty or fried\u00a0food \n \n Keeping a food diary may be a useful way of identifying possible triggers in your diet. \n Stress is another common trigger of IBS symptoms. Therefore, finding  ways to\u00a0manage\u00a0stressful situations  is an important part of treating the condition. \n Read more about  treating IBS .", "treatment": "The symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can\u00a0often be\u00a0managed by changing your diet and lifestyle, and understanding the\u00a0nature of the condition. \n In some cases,\u00a0medication\u00a0or psychological treatments may\u00a0also be\u00a0helpful. \n IBS-friendly diet \n Changing your diet will play\u00a0an important part in\u00a0controlling your\u00a0 symptoms of IBS . However, there is no \"one size fits all\" diet for people with the condition. The diet that works best for you will depend on\u00a0your symptoms and how you react to different foods. \n It may be helpful to keep a food diary and record whether certain foods make your symptoms better or worse.\u00a0You can then avoid foods that trigger your symptoms.\u00a0However, it's important to\u00a0remember that these foods will not necessarily need to be avoided for life. \n Fibre \n People with IBS are often advised to modify the amount of fibre in their diet. There are 2\u00a0main types of fibre: soluble fibre (which dissolves in water) and insoluble fibre\u00a0(which doesn't dissolve in water). \n Foods that contain soluble fibre include: \n \n oats \n barley \n rye \n fruit \u2013 such as bananas and apples \n root vegetables \u2013 such as carrots and potatoes \n golden linseeds \n \n Foods that contain insoluble fibre include: \n \n wholegrain bread \n bran \n cereals \n nuts and seeds (except golden linseeds) \n \n If you have  diarrhoea , you may find it helps to cut down on the insoluble fibre you eat. It may also help to avoid the skin, pith and pips from fruit and vegetables. \n If you have\u00a0 constipation , increasing the amount of soluble fibre in your diet and the amount of water you drink can help. \n Your GP may be able to\u00a0advise on what\u00a0your recommended fibre intake should be. \n Low FODMAP diet \n If you experience persistent or frequent bloating, a special diet called the low FODMAP diet can be effective. \n FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols. These are types of carbohydrates that aren\u2019t easily broken down and absorbed by the gut. This means they start to ferment in the gut relatively quickly, and the gases released during this process can lead to bloating. \n A low FODMAP diet essentially involves restricting your intake of various foods that are high in FODMAPs, such as some fruits and vegetables, animal milk, wheat products and beans. \n If you want to try the low FODMAP diet, it\u2019s best to do so under the guidance of a professional dietitian, who can ensure your diet is still healthy and balanced. You can ask your GP or specialist to refer you. \n You can read more about the\u00a0 low FODMAP diet  on the Kings College London website. \n General eating\u00a0tips \n Your IBS symptoms may also improve by: \n \n having regular meals and taking your time when eating \n not missing meals or leaving long gaps between eating \n drinking at least eight cups of fluid a day \u2013 particularly water and other non-caffeinated drinks, such as herbal tea \n restricting your tea and coffee intake to a maximum of three cups a day \n reducing the amount of alcohol and fizzy drinks you drink \n reducing your intake of resistant starch (starch that resists digestion in the small intestine and reaches the large intestine intact), which is often found in processed or re-cooked foods \n limiting fresh fruit to three portions a day \u2013 a suitable portion would be half a grapefruit or an apple \n if you have diarrhoea, avoiding sorbitol, an artificial sweetener\u00a0found in sugar-free sweets, including chewing gum and drinks, and in some diabetic and slimming products \n if you have wind ( flatulence ) and bloating,\u00a0it may help to eat oats (such as oat-based breakfast cereal or porridge) and linseeds (up to one tablespoon a day) \n \n Exercise \n Many people find that exercise helps to relieve the symptoms of IBS. Your GP can advise you on the type of exercise that is suitable for you. \n Aim to do a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. \n The exercise should be strenuous enough to increase your heart and breathing rates. \n Read more about  health and fitness \u00a0and  physical activity guidelines for adults . \n Reducing stress \n Reducing your stress levels may also reduce the frequency and severity of your IBS symptoms. Some ways to help relieve stress include: \n \n relaxation techniques \u2013 such as meditation or breathing exercises \n physical activities \u2013 such as\u00a0 yoga,\u00a0pilates or\u00a0tai chi  \n regular exercise \u2013 such as  walking ,\u00a0 running  or\u00a0 swimming  \n \n If you are particularly\u00a0stressed, you may benefit from a talking therapy, such as stress counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \n Read more about  how to manage stress . \n Probiotics \n Probiotics\u00a0are dietary supplements that product manufacturers claim can help improve digestive health. They contain so-called \"friendly bacteria\" that can supposedly\u00a0restore the natural balance of your gut bacteria when it has been disrupted. \n Some people find taking probiotics regularly helps to relieve the symptoms of IBS. However, there is\u00a0a little evidence to support this, and it is unclear exactly how much of a benefit probiotics offer and which types are most effective. \n If you want to try a probiotic product, you should\u00a0take it for at least 4\u00a0weeks to see if your symptoms improve, and you should follow the manufacturer's recommendations regarding dosage. \n Medication \n A\u00a0number of different medications\u00a0can be\u00a0used to help treat IBS, including: \n \n antispasmodics \u2013 which help\u00a0reduce abdominal (stomach) pain and cramping \n laxatives \u2013 which can help relieve constipation \n antimotility medicines \u2013 which can help relieve\u00a0diarrhoea \n low-dose antidepressants \u2013 which were originally designed to treat\u00a0 depression , but can also help reduce\u00a0stomach\u00a0pain and cramping independent of any antidepressant effect \n \n These medications are discussed in more detail below.\u00a0 \n Antispasmodics \n Antispasmodics work by helping to relax the muscles in your digestive system. Examples of antispasmodic medicines include mebeverine and therapeutic peppermint oil. \n Side effects associated with antispasmodics are rare. However, people taking peppermint oil may have occasional heartburn and irritation on the skin around their bottom. \n Laxatives \n Bulk-forming\u00a0 laxatives  are usually recommended for people with\u00a0IBS-related constipation. They make your stools softer, which means they are\u00a0easier to pass. \n It's important to drink plenty of fluids while using a bulk-forming laxative. This will help prevent the laxative from causing an obstruction in your digestive system. \n Start on a low dose and then, if necessary, increase it every few days until one or two soft stools are produced every one or two days. Do not\u00a0take a bulk-forming laxative just before you go to bed. \n Side effects associated with\u00a0taking laxatives can include bloating and wind. However, if you increase your dose gradually, you should have few, if any, side effects. \n Antimotility medicines \n The antimotility medicine\u00a0loperamide is usually recommended for IBS-related diarrhoea. \n Loperamide works by slowing\u00a0contractions of muscles in the bowel, which slows down the speed at which food passes through your digestive system. This allows more time for your stools to harden and solidify. \n Side effects of loperamide can include stomach cramps and bloating, dizziness, drowsiness and rashes. \n Antidepressants \n Two types of  antidepressants  are used to treat IBS \u2013 tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . \n TCAs, such as amitriptyline, are usually recommended when antispasmodic medicines have not been able to control the symptoms of pain and cramping. They work by preventing signals being sent to and from the nerves in your digestive system. \n However, TCAs\u00a0will only start to provide relief after three to four weeks, as your body gets used to the medication. \n Side effects of TCAs can include a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and drowsiness. These side effects should improve\u00a0within a few days of starting the medication. Tell your GP if the side effects become a problem \u2013 they may prescribe another\u00a0type of antidepressant. \n SSRIs are an alternative type of\u00a0antidepressant. Examples of SSRIs that are used to treat IBS include citalopram, fluoxetine\u00a0and paroxetine. \n Common side effects of SSRIs include blurred vision, dizziness and diarrhoea or constipation. \n Psychological treatments \n If your\u00a0IBS symptoms are still causing problems after 12 months of treatment, your GP\u00a0may refer you\u00a0for a type of therapy known as a psychological intervention. \n There are several different types of psychological therapy. They\u00a0all involve teaching you techniques to help you control your condition better, and there is good evidence to suggest they\u00a0may help some people with IBS. \n Psychological treatments that may be offered to people with IBS include: \n \n  psychotherapy  \u2013 a type of therapy that involves talking to a trained therapist to help you to look deeper into your problems and worries \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0\u2013 a type of psychotherapy that\u00a0involves examining how beliefs and thoughts are linked to behaviour and feelings, and teaches ways\u00a0to\u00a0alter your behaviour and way of thinking to help you\u00a0cope with your situation \n hypnotherapy \u2013 where hypnosis is used to change your unconscious mind's attitude towards your symptoms \n \n The availability of psychological interventions on the NHS may vary from region to region. \n Complementary therapies \n Some people\u00a0claim therapies such as acupuncture and reflexology can help people with IBS. However, there is\u00a0no medical evidence to suggest their effectiveness, and they are not recommended.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "There are no specific tests for IBS, as it does not cause any obvious detectable abnormalities in your digestive system. \n In most cases, a diagnosis will be based on whether you have typical\u00a0 symptoms of IBS . \n Your GP will\u00a0consider assessing\u00a0you for\u00a0IBS if you have had any of the following symptoms for at least 6\u00a0months: \n \n abdominal (stomach) pain or discomfort \n bloating \n a change in bowel habit \u2013 such as passing stools more frequently, diarrhoea and/or  constipation  \n \n A diagnosis of IBS will then be considered if\u00a0you have stomach pain or discomfort that is either relieved by\u00a0passing\u00a0stools, or is associated with a need to go to the toilet\u00a0frequently or a change in the consistency of your stools.\u00a0 \n This should be accompanied by at least 2\u00a0of the following 4\u00a0symptoms: \n \n a change in how you pass stools \u2013 such as needing to strain, feeling a sense of urgency or feeling you have not emptied your bowels properly \n bloating, hardness or tension in your stomach \n your symptoms get worse after eating \n passing mucus from your back passage \n \n Ruling out other conditions \n Many cases of IBS can be diagnosed based on your symptoms alone, although sometimes further tests may be needed to check for other possible causes. \n For example, your GP may arrange\u00a0 blood tests  to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as an infection or  coeliac disease  (a digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten). \n A sample of your stools will also often be tested for the presence of a substance called calprotectin. This substance is produced by the gut when it is inflamed, and its presence in your stools could mean your symptoms are being caused by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). \n Investigating 'red flags' \n Further tests\u00a0will be needed when you have certain \"red flag\" symptoms that\u00a0indicate you may have a potentially more serious condition, such as cancer. These symptoms include: \n \n unexplained weight loss \n a swelling or lump in your stomach or back passage \n bleeding from your back passage (rectum) \n  anaemia  \n \n Further testing may also be recommended if you have a family history of\u00a0 bowel cancer  or  ovarian cancer , or if you are over 60 years of age\u00a0and have had\u00a0a change in your bowel habits that has lasted for more than six weeks. \n In these cases, your doctor may recommend having a colonoscopy to check for abnormalities in your gut. This is where your rectum and large bowel (colon) are examined using an endoscope, which\u00a0is inserted into your rectum."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Iron deficiency anaemia", "introduction": "Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells. \n Iron is used to produce red blood cells, which\u00a0help store and carry oxygen in the blood. If you have fewer red blood cells than is normal, your organs and tissues won't get as much oxygen as they usually would. \n There are several different types of anaemia, and each one has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type. \n Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body\u00a0\u2013 read more about  vitamin B12 and folate deficiency anaemia . \n Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia \n Many people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops. \n You may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a  stomach ulcer . \n The most common symptoms\u00a0include: \n \n tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy) \n shortness of breath \n noticeable heartbeats\u00a0(heart palpitations) \n a pale complexion \n \n Less common symptoms\u00a0include: \n \n  headache \u00a0 \n hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source\u00a0 (tinnitus)  \n an altered sense of taste \n feeling itchy \n a sore or\u00a0abnormally smooth tongue \n hair loss \n a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica) \n difficulty swallowing  (dysphagia)  \n painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth \n spoon-shaped nails \n \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple\u00a0 blood test . \n Read more about  diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia  \n What causes iron deficiency anaemia? \n There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines. \n This can be caused by a stomach ulcer,  stomach cancer ,  bowel cancer , or by taking\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). \n In women\u00a0of reproductive age,\u00a0heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby\u00a0during pregnancy. \n Unless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above. \n Read more about the  causes of iron deficiency anaemia  \n How iron deficiency anaemia is treated \n Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to\u00a0boost the\u00a0low levels of\u00a0iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes\u00a0long-term problems. \n You'll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal. \n The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don't get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended. \n Good sources of iron include: \n \n dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale \n iron-fortified cereals or bread \n brown rice\u00a0 \n pulses and beans \n nuts and seeds \n meat, fish and\u00a0tofu \n eggs \n dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins \n \n Read more about  treating iron deficiency anaemia  \n Further problems \n If iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects\u00a0the body's natural defence system\u00a0(the immune system). \n Severe iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or\u00a0 heart failure , where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure. \n Pregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth. \n Read more about the  complications of iron deficiency anaemia", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Iron deficiency anaemia occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron, leading to the decreased production of red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. \n A lack of iron can be caused by several factors. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are\u00a0outlined below. \n Monthly periods \n In women of reproductive age,\u00a0periods are the\u00a0most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. \n Usually, only women with heavy periods develop iron deficiency anaemia. If you have heavy bleeding over several consecutive menstrual cycles, it's known as menorrhagia. \n Pregnancy \n It's also very common for women to develop iron deficiency during pregnancy. \n This is because your body needs extra iron\u00a0to ensure your baby has a sufficient blood supply and receives necessary oxygen and nutrients.\u00a0 \n Some pregnant women require an iron supplement, while\u00a0others may need to increase the amount of iron in their diet. \n Read more about  vitamins and nutrition in pregnancy  \n Gastrointestinal blood loss \n The gastrointestinal tract is the part of the body responsible for digesting food. It contains the stomach and intestines. \n Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of iron deficiency anaemia in men, as well as women who've experienced the  menopause  (when monthly periods stop). \n Most people with gastrointestinal bleeding don't notice any obvious blood in their stools and don't experience any changes in their bowel habits. \n Some\u00a0causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are described below. \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u00a0can cause bleeding in the stomach.  Ibuprofen  and\u00a0 aspirin  are two commonly prescribed NSAIDs. \n If your GP thinks your medication is causing gastrointestinal bleeding, they can prescribe a less harmful medicine. However, don't stop taking a medicine you've been prescribed unless your GP advises you to. \n Stomach ulcers \n The acid in your stomach, which helps your body digest food, can sometimes eat into your stomach lining. When this happens, the acid forms an open sore (an ulcer). This is also known as a  stomach ulcer  or a peptic ulcer. \n Stomach ulcers can cause the stomach lining to bleed, which can lead to anaemia. In some cases, the bleeding\u00a0can cause you to\u00a0vomit blood or pass blood in your stools. However, if the ulcer bleeds slowly, you may not\u00a0have any symptoms. \n Gastrointestinal cancer \n In\u00a0a few\u00a0cases, gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by cancer, usually  stomach cancer  or  bowel cancer . \n When trying to establish the cause of anaemia, your GP will check for possible signs of cancer. \n If your GP suspects cancer, you'll be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in treating digestive conditions) for a more thorough examination. This means that if cancer is found, it can be treated as quickly as possible. \n If you're 60 years old or over and have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP\u00a0should refer you\u00a0to a specialist to rule out bowel cancer. Your\u00a0 appointment with the specialist should be within two weeks of your GP referring you. \n Angiodysplasia \n Gastrointestinal bleeding can also be caused by a condition called angiodysplasia. This is\u00a0the result\u00a0of\u00a0abnormal, fragile superficial\u00a0blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, which can cause bleeding. \n Chronic kidney disease \n People with  chronic kidney disease (CKD)  often develop iron deficiency anaemia. \n Most people with CKD who have iron deficiency anaemia will be given iron supplement injections, although daily tablets\u00a0may be\u00a0tried first. \n You can read more about\u00a0 treating anaemia in people with CKD \u00a0on the National Institute\u00a0for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. \n Other causes \n Other conditions or actions that cause blood loss and may lead to iron deficiency anaemia include: \n \n inflammatory bowel disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that causes redness and swelling (inflammation) in the digestive system, such as  Crohn's disease  and\u00a0 ulcerative colitis \u00a0 \n oesophagitis \u2013\u00a0inflammation of the gullet (oesophagus)\u00a0caused by stomach acid leaking through it \n schistosomiasis\u00a0\u2013 an infection caused by parasites, mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa \n blood donation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0donating a large amount of blood may lead to anaemia \n trauma \u2013\u00a0a serious accident, such as a car crash, may cause you to lose a large amount of blood\u00a0 \n  nosebleeds \u00a0\u2013\u00a0having regular nosebleeds may lead to anaemia, although\u00a0this is rare \n haematuria (blood in your urine) \u2013 but this rarely causes anaemia\u00a0and may be a symptom of another condition \n \n Malabsorption \n Malabsorption is when your body can't absorb iron from food, and is another possible cause of iron deficiency anaemia. \n This may happen if you have  coeliac disease , a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten, or surgery to remove all or part of your stomach (gastrectomy). \n Lack of iron in your diet \n Unless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused solely by a lack of iron in your diet. \n However, a lack of dietary iron can increase your risk of developing anaemia if you also have any of the conditions mentioned above. \n Some studies suggest vegetarians or vegans are more at risk of iron deficiency anaemia because of the lack of meat in their diet. \n If you are vegetarian or vegan,\u00a0it is possible to gain enough iron by eating other types of food, such as: \n \n beans \n nuts \n dried fruit, such as dried apricots \n wholegrains, such as brown rice \n fortified breakfast cereals \n soybean flour \n most dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale \n \n If you're pregnant, you may need to increase the amount of iron-rich food you consume during pregnancy to help prevent iron deficiency anaemia. \n Read more about  vegetarian and vegan diets", "treatment": "Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia usually involves taking iron supplements and changing your diet to increase your iron levels, as well as treating the underlying cause. \n Iron supplements \n Your GP will prescribe an iron supplement to restore the iron missing from your body. The most commonly prescribed supplement is ferrous sulphate,\u00a0which is taken\u00a0as a tablet, usually twice a day. \n Some people can\u00a0experience side effects when taking iron supplements, including: \n \n  abdominal (tummy) pain  \n  constipation \u00a0or  diarrhoea  \n heartburn \n feeling sick \n black stools (faeces) \n \n These side effects should settle down over time. However, your GP may recommend taking the tablets with food or shortly after eating if you have troublesome side effects. \n Your GP may also advise you to only take one or two tablets a day, instead of three, if you're finding side effects difficult to cope with. \n If you can't take ferrous sulphate because you get severe side effects, you may be prescribed a different iron supplement called ferrous gluconate. \n This supplement should cause fewer side effects because it contains a less concentrated dose of iron. However, it may take longer for the iron levels in your body to be restored. \n In\u00a0a few\u00a0cases\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you have  chronic kidney disease (CKD) \u00a0\u2013 iron injections may be recommended instead of tablets. \n As with all medications,\u00a0it's important to store iron supplements out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron supplements in a young child can be fatal. \n Dietary advice \n If a lack of iron in your diet is thought to be contributing to your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you how to up your intake. \n Iron-rich foods include: \n \n dark-green leafy vegetables, such as\u00a0watercress and curly kale \n iron-fortified cereals or bread \n brown rice\u00a0 \n pulses and beans\u00a0 \n nuts and seeds \n white and red meat\u00a0 \n fish\u00a0 \n tofu \n eggs\u00a0 \n dried fruit,\u00a0such as\u00a0dried apricots, prunes and raisins \n \n Your diet should include foods from all the major food groups to ensure it's\u00a0healthy and balanced. In particular,\u00a0food and drink containing vitamin C\u00a0are important\u00a0as vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. \n However, consuming large amounts of some foods and drinks, as well as certain\u00a0medicines,\u00a0may make it harder for your body to absorb iron. These include: \n \n tea and coffee \n calcium\u00a0\u2013\u00a0found in\u00a0dairy products, such as milk\u00a0 \n antacids\u00a0and\u00a0proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0medications used\u00a0to relieve  indigestion  \n wholegrain cereals\u00a0\u2013\u00a0although wholegrains are a good source of iron themselves, they contain phytic acid, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and pills \n \n You may be referred to a nutrition specialist called a dietitian if you're finding it difficult to include iron in your diet. They'll be able to give you detailed, personalised advice about how you can\u00a0improve your diet. \n Treating the underlying cause \n Your GP will also need to ensure\u00a0the underlying cause of your anaemia is treated so\u00a0it doesn't happen again. \n For example, if\u00a0non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are causing bleeding in your stomach, your GP may prescribe a different medicine to help minimise the risk of stomach bleeding. \n Heavy periods can\u00a0be treated with\u00a0medication or \u2013\u00a0in particularly severe cases \u2013\u00a0surgery. \n Monitoring \n Your GP will ask you to return two to four weeks after you've started taking\u00a0iron supplements to check how well you've responded to the treatment. You'll have a\u00a0 blood test \u00a0to check your haemoglobin levels. \n If your\u00a0blood test results show an improvement, you'll be asked to continue taking iron supplements and return in two to four\u00a0months for another blood test. \n Once your haemoglobin levels and red blood cells are normal, your GP will usually recommend continuing to\u00a0take iron supplements for three months to help build up the iron levels in your body. \n After this, you should be able to stop taking the supplements, depending on the cause of your iron deficiency anaemia. Your condition will be monitored every three months over the course of a year, and again a year later. \n Continuing treatment \n Sometimes after a person's iron levels have been replenished, they start to fall again. \n This could happen if you don't get enough iron in your diet, you're pregnant, or you have consistently heavy periods. \n In such cases, you may be prescribed an ongoing iron supplement to help stop your anaemia returning. This will usually be a tablet, which you'll have to take once a day.\u00a0 \n If treatment is ineffective \n If your iron levels don't improve, your GP will ask how regularly you've been taking your iron supplements. \n Some people are put off taking the medication because of the side effects. However, your condition won't improve if you don't take the supplements. \n If you've been taking the supplements as prescribed and your iron levels still haven't improved, your GP may refer you to a specialist for an assessment.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you experience  symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia , such as tiredness, shortness of breath and heart palpitations. \n A simple blood test can usually confirm the diagnosis. \n Your GP may also carry out a physical examination and ask you a number of questions to help determine the cause of your anaemia. \n Blood test \n To diagnose iron deficiency anaemia, a blood sample\u00a0is taken from a vein in your arm and a full blood count\u00a0is made. This means\u00a0all the different types of blood cells in the sample will be measured. \n If you have anaemia: \n \n your levels of haemoglobin\u00a0\u2013 a substance that transports oxygen\u00a0\u2013 will be lower than normal \n you'll have fewer red blood cells, which contain haemoglobin, than normal \n your red blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual \n \n Your GP may also test for a substance called ferritin, a protein that stores iron. If your ferritin levels are low, it means there isn't much iron stored in your body and you may\u00a0have iron deficiency anaemia. \n Read more about  blood tests \u00a0 \n Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency \n If your GP thinks your anaemia may be the result of a vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, the levels of these substances may be tested. Folate works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells. \n  Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency\u00a0anaemia \u00a0is more common in people who are over the age of\u00a075. \n Finding the cause \n To determine the underlying cause of your anaemia, your GP may ask questions about your lifestyle and medical history. For example, they may ask you about: \n \n your diet \u2013\u00a0to see what you typically eat and whether this includes any iron-rich foods \n any medicines you take \u2013\u00a0to see if you've been regularly taking a type of medicine that can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines (gastrointestinal bleeding), such as\u00a0 ibuprofen  or\u00a0 aspirin  \n your menstrual pattern \u2013\u00a0if you're a woman, your GP may ask if you've been experiencing particularly heavy periods \n your family history \u2013\u00a0you'll be asked if your immediate family has anaemia or\u00a0a history of gastrointestinal bleeding or blood disorders \n \n Iron\u00a0deficiency anaemia is common during pregnancy. If you're pregnant, your GP will usually only look for an alternative cause if a blood test has identified a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your symptoms or medical history suggest your anaemia may be caused by something else. \n Physical examination \n A\u00a0physical examination will usually only be needed if the cause of your iron anaemia deficiency hasn't been identified by examining your medical history and asking you about your symptoms. \n In such cases, your GP may: \n \n examine your stomach (abdomen) to check for any physical signs of gastrointestinal bleeding \n look for signs of\u00a0 heart failure , such as\u00a0swollen ankles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0heart failure can have some similar symptoms to iron deficiency anaemia \n \n Two other possible types of physical examination you may have are explained below. \n Rectal examination \n A\u00a0rectal examination is usually only needed if you're bleeding from your bottom. It's\u00a0a common procedure that can help your GP find out if there's something in your gastrointestinal tract that's causing bleeding. \n Your GP will insert a lubricated\u00a0gloved\u00a0finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities. \n A rectal examination isn't something to be embarrassed about, as it's a procedure your GP will be used to doing. It shouldn't cause significant pain, but it may cause some slight discomfort\u00a0\u2013 this will only last for a minute. \n Pelvic examination \n Women may have a pelvic examination if their GP thinks heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia. \n During a pelvic examination, your GP will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection. \n They may also examine you internally. This will involve your GP inserting lubricated gloved fingers into your vagina to feel whether your\u00a0womb (uterus)\u00a0is tender or enlarged. \n A pelvic examination won't be carried out without your consent\u00a0(permission), and you can choose to have someone with you. \n Referral to a specialist \n In some cases, your GP may refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in treating digestive conditions. They'll carry out a more thorough examination. \n For example, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist if your GP can't identify a cause and you have a particularly low haemoglobin level, or if your GP thinks there's a possibility your symptoms could be caused by  stomach cancer  or\u00a0 bowel cancer , although this is unlikely. \n If you're a woman with heavy periods, you may be referred to a gynaecologist if you don't respond to treatment with iron supplements."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Insomnia", "introduction": "Insomnia is difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep for long enough to feel refreshed the next morning. \n It's a common problem thought to regularly affect around one in every three people in the UK, and is particularly common in elderly people. \n If you have insomnia, you may: \n \n find it difficult to fall asleep \n lie awake for long periods at night \n wake up several times during the night \n wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep \n not feel refreshed when you get up \n find it hard to nap during the day, despite feeling tired \n feel tired and irritable during the day and have difficulty concentrating \n \n Occasional episodes of insomnia may come and go without causing any serious problems, but for some people it can last for months or even years at a time. \n Persistent insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you're able to do during the day, affect your mood, and lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues. \n How much sleep do I need? \n There are no official guidelines about how much sleep you should get each night because everyone is different. \n On average, a \"normal\" amount of sleep for an adult is considered to be around seven to nine hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less. \n What's important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality. \n You're probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if you constantly feel tired throughout the day and it's affecting your everyday life. \n What causes insomnia? \n It's not always clear what triggers insomnia, but it's often associated with: \n \n stress and anxiety \n a poor sleeping environment \u2013 such as an uncomfortable bed, or a bedroom that's too light, noisy, hot or cold \n lifestyle factors \u2013 such as jet lag, shift work, or drinking alcohol or caffeine before going to bed \n mental health conditions \u2013 such as\u00a0 depression  and  schizophrenia  \n physical health conditions \u2013 such as heart problems,\u00a0other sleep disorders and long-term pain \n certain medicines \u2013 such as some  antidepressants ,\u00a0 epilepsy  medicines and\u00a0 steroid medication  \n \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of insomnia  \n What you can\u00a0do about it \n There are a number of things you can try to help yourself get a good night's sleep if you have insomnia. \n These include: \n \n setting regular times for going to bed and waking up \n relaxing before bed time\u00a0\u2013 try taking a warm bath or listening to calming music \n using thick curtains or blinds, an eye mask and earplugs to stop you being woken up by light and noise \n avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, heavy meals\u00a0and exercise for a few hours before going to bed \n not watching TV or using phones, tablets or computers shortly before\u00a0going to bed\u00a0 \n not napping during the day \n writing a list of your worries, and any ideas\u00a0about\u00a0how to\u00a0solve them, before going to bed to help you forget about\u00a0them until the morning \n \n Some people find over-the-counter sleeping tablets helpful, but they don't address the underlying problem and can have troublesome side effects. \n Read more\u00a0 self-help tips for insomnia  \n When to see your GP \n Make an appointment to see your GP if you're finding it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep and it's affecting your daily life \u2013 particularly if it has been a problem for a month or more and the above measures have not helped. \n Your GP may ask you about your sleeping routines, your daily alcohol and caffeine consumption, and your general lifestyle habits, such as diet and exercise. \n They will also check your medical history for any illness or medication that may be contributing to your insomnia. \n Your GP may suggest keeping a sleep diary for a couple of weeks to help them gain a better understanding of your sleep patterns. \n Each day, make a note of things such as the time you went to bed and woke up, how long it took you to fall asleep, and the number of times you woke up during the night. \n Treatments for\u00a0insomnia \n Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition, such as anxiety, that may be causing your sleep problems. \n They'll probably also discuss things you can do at home that may help to improve your sleep. \n In some cases, a special type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0designed for people with insomnia (CBT-I) may be recommended. \n This is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you avoid the thoughts and behaviours affecting your sleep. It's usually the first treatment recommended and can help lead to long-term improvement of your sleep. \n Prescription sleeping tablets are usually only considered as a last resort and should be used for only a few days or weeks at a time. \n This is because they don't treat the cause of your insomnia and are associated with a number of side effects. They can also become less effective over time. \n Read more about  treating insomnia", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Insomnia can be triggered by a number of possible factors, including worry and stress, underlying health conditions, and alcohol or drug use. \n Sometimes it's not possible to identify a clear cause. \n Stress and anxiety \n Some people develop insomnia after a stressful event, such as a bereavement, problems at work, or financial difficulties. \n The problem can continue long after the event has passed because they start to associate going to bed with being awake. This develops into an anxiety about sleep itself. \n Having more general worries\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, about work, family or health\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are also likely to keep you awake at night. \n These can cause your mind to start racing while you lie in bed, which can be made worse by also worrying about not being able to sleep. \n Poor sleep routine and\u00a0sleeping environment \n You may struggle to get a good night's sleep if you go to bed at inconsistent times, nap during the day, or don't \"wind down\" before going to bed. \n A poor sleeping environment can also contribute to insomnia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for instance, an uncomfortable bed or a bedroom that's too bright, noisy, hot or cold. \n Lifestyle factors \n Drinking alcohol before going to bed and taking certain recreational drugs can affect your sleep, as can stimulants such as nicotine (found in cigarettes) and caffeine (found in tea, coffee and energy drinks). These should be avoided in the evenings. \n Changes to your sleeping patterns can also contribute to insomnia\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, because of shift work or changing time zones after a long-haul flight (jet lag). \n Mental health conditions \n Underlying mental health problems can often affect a person's sleeping patterns, including: \n \n mood disorders \u2013 such as  depression  or  bipolar disorder  \n anxiety disorders\u2013 such as generalised anxiety,  panic disorder  or  post-traumatic stress disorder  \n psychotic disorders \u2013 such as  schizophrenia  \n \n Physical health\u00a0conditions \n Insomnia can also be caused by underlying physical conditions, including: \n \n heart conditions \u2013 such as\u00a0 angina \u00a0or\u00a0 heart failure  \n respiratory conditions \u2013 such as  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  or  asthma  \n neurological\u00a0conditions \u2013 such as  Alzheimer's disease  or  Parkinson's disease  \n hormonal problems \u2013 such as an  overactive thyroid  \n joint or muscle problems \u2013 such as\u00a0 arthritis  \n problems with the genital or urinary organs \u2013 such as  urinary incontinence  or an  enlarged prostate  \n sleep disorders \u2013 such as snoring and  sleep apnoea ,  restless legs syndrome ,\u00a0narcolepsy, night terrors and sleepwalking \n long-term pain \n \n In women, childbirth can sometimes lead to insomnia. \n Medication \n Some prescriptions or over-the-counter medications can cause insomnia as a side effect. \n These include: \n \n certain\u00a0 antidepressants  \n  epilepsy  medicines \n medicines for  high blood pressure , such as  beta-blockers  \n  steroid medication  \n  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  \n stimulant medicines used to treat  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  or narcolepsy \n some medicines used to treat asthma, such as salbutamol, salmeterol and theophylline \n \n Check the leaflet that comes with any medication you're taking to see if insomnia or sleeping difficulties are listed as a possible side effect.", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ingrown toenail", "introduction": "An ingrown toenail develops when the sides of the toenail grow into the surrounding skin. \n The big toe is often affected, either on one or both sides. The nail curls and pierces the skin, which becomes red, swollen and tender. \n Other possible symptoms include: \n \n pain if pressure is placed on the toe \n inflammation of the skin at the end of the toe \n a build-up of fluid (oedema) in the area surrounding the toe \n an overgrowth of skin around the affected toe (hypertrophy) \n bleeding \n white or yellow pus coming from the affected area \n \n When to see your GP \n See your GP or podiatrist (foot care specialist) if your ingrown toenail is badly inflamed, bleeding or has pus coming from it, because it may be infected. \n It's also important to seek medical advice if you have\u00a0diabetes and an ingrown toenail. Having diabetes could affect how your toenail heals. \n What causes ingrown toenails? \n A number of things can cause an ingrown toenail to develop, including: \n \n badly cut toenails \u2013 cutting your toenails too short, or cutting the edges, will encourage the skin to fold over your nail and the nail to grow into the skin \n wearing tight-fitting shoes, socks or tights \u2013 this places pressure on the skin around your toenail; the skin may be pierced if it's pressed on to your toenail \n sweaty feet \u2013 if the skin around your toenails is soft, it's easier for your nail to pierce it and embed itself within it \n injury \u2013 for example, stubbing your toe can sometimes cause an ingrown toenail to develop \n natural shape of the nail \u2013 the sides of curved or fan-shaped toenails are more likely to press into the skin surrounding the nail \n \n A\u00a0 fungal nail infection  can cause your toenail to thicken or widen. \n Treating ingrown toenails \n Left untreated, an ingrown toenail can become infected, so it\u2019s important that you: \n \n keep your feet clean by washing them regularly with soap and water \n change your socks regularly \n cut your toenails straight across to stop them digging into the surrounding skin \n gently push the skin away from the nail using a cotton bud (this may be easier after using a small amount of olive oil to soften the skin) \n wear comfortable shoes that fit properly \n \n Surgery may be recommended if your toenail doesn't improve. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, this may involve removing part or all of your toenail. \n Partial nail avulsion \n Partial nail avulsion removes part of your toenail and is the most commonly used operation for treating ingrown toenails. It's about 98% effective. \n A\u00a0 local anaesthetic \u00a0is used to numb your toe and the edges of your toenail are cut away. A chemical called phenol is applied to the affected area to prevent the nail growing back and becoming ingrown in the future. \n A course of\u00a0 antibiotics  may be prescribed if your nail is infected, and any pus will be drained away. \n Total nail avulsion \n Total nail avulsion completely removes your toenail. This may be necessary if your nail is thick and pressing into the skin surrounding your toe. After your toenail has been removed, you\u2019ll have an indentation where your nail used to be. However, it's perfectly safe for you not to have a toenail. \n After surgery \n After toenail surgery, your toe will be wrapped in a sterile bandage. This will help stem any bleeding and prevent infection. Rest your foot and keep it raised for 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0days after the operation. \n To help reduce the pain, you may need to take a painkiller, such as  paracetamol , and wear soft or open-toed shoes for the first few days after surgery. \n Preventing ingrown toenails \n Taking care of your feet will help prevent foot problems such as ingrown toenails. It\u2019s important to cut your toenails properly (straight across, not at an angle or down the edges). \n Wash your feet every day, dry them thoroughly and use foot moisturiser. You can also use a foot file or pumice stone to remove hard or dead skin. \n Wearing shoes that fit properly will help to ensure your feet remain healthy. You should also change your socks (or tights) every day. \n Visit your GP or a podiatrist as soon as possible if you develop problems with your feet.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hyperhidrosis", "introduction": "Hyperhidrosis is a common condition in which a person sweats excessively. \n The sweating may affect the whole of your body, or it may only affect certain areas.\u00a0Commonly affected areas include\u00a0the: \n \n armpits \n palms of your hands \n soles of your feet \n face and chest \n groin \n \n Both sides of the body are usually affected equally \u2013 for example, both feet or both hands. \n The sweating doesn't usually pose a serious threat to\u00a0your health, but it can be embarrassing and distressing. It can also have a negative impact on your quality of life and may lead to\u00a0feelings of  depression  and  anxiety . \n Read more about the  complications of hyperhidrosis . \n What is excessive sweating? \n There are no guidelines to determine what \"normal\" sweating is, but if you feel you sweat\u00a0too much\u00a0and\u00a0your sweating\u00a0has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis. \n For example, you may have hyperhidrosis if: \n \n you\u00a0avoid physical contact, such as shaking hands,\u00a0because you\u00a0feel self-conscious about your sweating \n you don't take part in activities, such as dancing or exercise, for fear they will make your sweating worse \n excessive sweating is interfering with your job \u2013 for example, you have difficulty holding tools or using a computer keyboard \n you're having problems with normal daily activities, such as driving \n you're spending a significant amount of time\u00a0coping with\u00a0sweating \u2013 for example, frequently showering and changing your clothes \n you become socially withdrawn and self-conscious \n \n When to see your GP \n Visit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively. \n Many people with hyperhidrosis are too embarrassed to seek medical help or believe that nothing can be done to improve it.\u00a0But\u00a0treatment is\u00a0available. \n Also visit your GP if you are\u00a0having\u00a0night sweats, because it can sometimes be a sign of something more serious. \n Your GP will usually be able to diagnose hyperhidrosis based on your symptoms, although occasionally you may need blood and urine tests to\u00a0check for an underlying cause (see below). \n What causes hyperhidrosis? \n In many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis. \n Hyperhidrosis that does have an identifiable cause is known as secondary hyperhidrosis. This can have many different triggers, including: \n \n pregnancy or the  menopause  \n anxiety \n certain medications \n low blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) \n an overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) \n infections \n \n Read more about the  causes of hyperhidrosis . \n How hyperhidrosis is treated \n Excessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you.\u00a0 \n Doctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants.\u00a0Lifestyle changes\u00a0may also help, including: \n \n wearing loose and light clothes \n avoiding triggers, such as alcohol and spicy foods, that could make your sweating worse \n wearing black or white clothes\u00a0to\u00a0help minimise the signs of sweating \n \n If this doesn\u2019t help, you may be advised to try treatments such as iontophoresis (the affected area is treated with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad), botulinum toxin injections, and even surgery in a few cases. \n Hyperhidrosis is usually a long-term condition, but some people experience an improvement with time and the treatments available can often keep the problem under control. \n Read more about  treating hyperhidrosis . \n Who is affected \n Hyperhidrosis is common. It's been estimated to affect between 1\u00a0and 3\u00a0in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it in the UK. \n Hyperhidrosis can develop at any age, although primary hyperhidrosis typically starts during childhood or soon after puberty.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Hyperhidrosis can be divided into 2\u00a0types, depending on whether an obvious cause can be identified. These are known as primary and secondary hyperhidrosis. \n Primary hyperhidrosis \n Hyperhidrosis that has no obvious cause is known as primary hyperhidrosis. \n Although it's not clear\u00a0why it\u00a0develops, it's thought to be the result of a problem with part of the nervous system called the sympathetic nervous system, and it's possible your genes may also play a role. \n The sympathetic nervous system \n The sympathetic nervous system controls most of your body\u2019s functions that do not require conscious thought, such as movement of food through your body and the movement of urine out of your kidneys and into your bladder. \n The sympathetic nervous system also acts like a thermostat. If it senses you are getting too hot, it will send a signal from your brain to the millions of sweat glands in your body to produce sweat. The sweat cools on your skin and reduces the temperature of your body. \n A specific type of sweat gland, known as the eccrine glands, appears to be involved in hyperhidrosis. There are more eccrine glands on your armpits, hands, feet and face, which may explain why these areas are often affected by hyperhidrosis. \n It's thought that in cases of primary hyperhidrosis, the brain sends signals to the eccrine glands, even though there is no need to cool the body. \n Genes \n Some cases of primary hyperhidrosis appear to\u00a0run in families, which suggests a genetic mutation may be the cause. \n A genetic mutation is where the instructions in your cells become scrambled, which can disrupt the normal workings of the body. Some genetic mutations can be passed down from parents to their children. \n Secondary hyperhidrosis \n If a cause of hyperhidrosis can be identified, it's known as secondary hyperhidrosis. \n Secondary hyperhidrosis can have a number of different triggers, including: \n \n pregnancy \n the  menopause \u00a0\u2013 when a woman\u2019s monthly periods stop \n anxiety \n low blood sugar ( hypoglycaemia ) \n an overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) \n  obesity  \n certain medications \u2013 including some  antidepressants ,\u00a0propranolol, pilocarpine, and\u00a0bethanechol \n being drunk or \"high\" on drugs, or withdrawing from alcohol or drugs if you\u00a0have become addicted to them \n some infections, such as\u00a0 tuberculosis  and\u00a0 HIV  \n  Parkinson\u2019s disease \u00a0 \n disorders of the blood cells or bone marrow, such as  Hodgkin lymphoma  (a cancer of the white blood cells) \n \n Secondary hyperhidrosis often starts more suddenly than primary hyperhidrosis and tends to affect the whole body.", "treatment": "Hyperhidrosis can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find the best treatment for you. Less invasive treatments will usually be recommended first. \n Lifestyle changes \n Changing your lifestyle cannot cure primary hyperhidrosis (hyperhidrosis with no obvious cause), but it can improve your symptoms and help your confidence. \n The advice below may help. \n \n Avoid\u00a0triggers that you know make your sweating worse, such as spicy foods and alcohol \n Use antiperspirant frequently, rather than deodorant \n Avoid wearing tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibres, such as nylon \n Wearing black or white clothing can\u00a0minimise signs of sweating \n Armpit shields can absorb excessive sweat and protect your clothes \n Wear socks that absorb moisture, such as thick socks made of natural fibres, or special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture \n Avoid wearing socks made out of man-made materials and change your socks at least twice a day if possible \n Ideally wear\u00a0shoes made of leather, and\u00a0try to alternate between different pairs of shoes every day \n \n Stronger antiperspirants \n If\u00a0a regular antiperspirant doesn't\u00a0control your sweating, your GP may prescribe\u00a0or suggest\u00a0a stronger one for you. \n Antiperspirant containing aluminium chloride is often used to treat hyperhidrosis. This works by plugging the sweat glands. You will need to apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning. \n The most common side effect of aluminium chloride is mild irritation or itching and tingling where it is applied. Using the antiperspirant less frequently can help reduce irritation. Using emollients (moisturisers) regularly and soap substitutes instead of soap may also help. \n Anticholinergics \n You may be prescribed a type of medicine called an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic. These work by blocking the effects of a chemical called acetylcholine, which the nervous system uses to activate the sweat glands. \n Anticholinergics are available as tablets or solutions that are applied to affected areas. They're not widely used to treat hyperhidrosis and most types are not licensed to treat it, but some people find them helpful. \n Propantheline bromide is an anticholinergic medicine licensed for treating hyperhidrosis. However, anticholinergic medicines unlicensed for hyperhidrosis \u2013 such as oxybutynin and glycopyrronium bromide \u2013 can also be prescribed if your doctor feels they might help. \n Possible side effects of anticholinergics include a  dry mouth , blurred vision, stomach cramps,  constipation  and difficulty passing urine. \n Referral to a dermatologist \n If lifestyle changes and treatment don't work, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) for further treatment, such as iontophoresis, botulinum toxin or surgery. \n Iontophoresis \n Iontophoresis\u00a0may help if you have excessive sweating that affects your hands or feet. It can also be used to treat armpits, although this is usually less effective. \n Iontophoresis involves treating affected areas of skin with a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad. This is thought to help block the sweat glands. \n If your hands and feet need treating, you place them in a bowl of water and a weak electric current is passed through the water. If your armpits need treating, a wet contact pad is placed against each armpit and a current is passed through the pad. \n The treatment is not painful but the electric current can cause mild, short-lived discomfort and skin irritation. \n Each session of iontophoresis lasts between 20 and 30 minutes, and you will usually need to have 2\u00a0to 4\u00a0sessions a week. Your symptoms should begin to improve after a week or 2, after which further treatment will be required at 1\u00a0to 4\u00a0week intervals, depending on how severe your symptoms are. \n Iontophoresis is often very effective, although you may need to make regular visits to your local hospital\u2019s dermatology clinic to receive treatment. \n Alternatively, iontophoresis kits that you can use at home may be recommended, with prices in the range of \u00a3250-500. \n Botulinum toxin injections \n Botulinum toxin can be injected into the skin in areas of the body affected by hyperhidrosis. This helps reduce sweating in these areas by blocking the signals from the brain to the sweat glands. \n Around 15-20 injections are given in the affected areas of the body, such as the armpits, hands, feet or face. The procedure usually takes about 30-45 minutes in total. \n The effect of the injections usually lasts for several months, after which time the treatment can be repeated if necessary. \n Potential side effects of\u00a0botulinum toxin injections include: \n \n pain, redness or itching where the injections are given \n nausea, headaches and hot flushes after the injections are given \n another part of your body sweating more to make up for treated area \u2013 known as compensatory sweating \n muscle weakness around the treatment area \n \n Most of these side effects are short-lived or will resolve as the effect of the injections wears off. \n Availability of botulinum toxin on the NHS can vary widely depending on your clinical commissioning group (CCG), and you may only be able to get it privately. Costs for private treatment depend on the part of the body being treated. For example, injecting the forehead can cost around \u00a3150, while treating both armpits could cost up to \u00a3450 or more. \n Surgery and other procedures \n In a few cases where hyperhidrosis is particularly severe and treatment\u00a0hasn't been successful, surgery may be recommended. \n Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) \n Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is the most widely used type of surgery to treat hyperhidrosis. It's usually used in cases affecting the palms or armpits. \n Small incisions are made in the side of the chest and the nerves that control sweating in the affected area are cut or clipped. This means signals can no longer pass along them to the sweat glands. The operation is carried out under  general anaesthetic  and done on both sides of the body. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that ETS can be used to treat excessive sweating of the palms or underarms. However, before the procedure is performed, your clinician should explain: \n \n ETS\u00a0carries a risk of serious complications (see below) \n it's very common for excessive compensatory sweating to occur after the procedure, which causes some people to regret the procedure \n the procedure is not always successful at reducing sweating \n \n For this reason, only people with severe hyperhidrosis which hasn't responded to treatment should be considered. \n Read the full  NICE guidelines on endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy for primary hyperhidrosis of the upper limb . \n Side effects and complications of ETS can also include: \n \n sweating of the face and neck after eating food \u2013 this is known as gustatory sweating and may affect up to half of people who have the procedure \n bleeding into the chest during surgery \n air becoming trapped inside the chest (pneumothorax), which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties \n damage to the nervous system that causes\u00a0the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop (Horner's syndrome) \u2013 this may be permanent \n \n Removing or destroying sweat glands \n Excessive sweating under the arms may occasionally be treated with a procedure to remove or destroy the sweat glands in the armpits. \n This can be carried out in a number of ways: \n \n making an incision in the armpit and carefully scraping away (curettage) or cutting out (Shelley\u2019s procedure) the sweat glands \n using a probe held above the skin (no incisions are needed), which emits electromagnetic radiation that destroys the sweat glands \n inserting a laser device under the skin through a small incision and using it to destroy the sweat glands \n \n These procedures are generally carried out under  local anaesthetic , which means you will be awake but your armpit will be numbed. \n These procedures can sometimes be a permanent solution to excessive underarm sweating, although they are only carried out by a small number of practitioners. Availability on the NHS is likely to be very limited and you will probably need to pay for private treatment. \n These procedures don't work for everyone and some of them are relatively new, which means there isn't always evidence about their long-term safety and effectiveness. \n Treating anxiety \n Feelings of anxiety are not directly responsible for causing primary hyperhidrosis, but they can make the situation worse and create a vicious cycle. \n You may feel self-conscious, which can trigger anxiety in certain situations, such as when meeting new people or being in a crowded room. The anxiety can make the sweating worse. \n If your anxiety is making your sweating worse, a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0might help. Medication for anxiety is not usually recommended because it can make sweating worse.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)", "introduction": "Hypoglycaemia, or a \"hypo\", is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre). \n When your glucose (sugar)\u00a0level is too\u00a0low, your body doesn't have enough energy to carry out its activities. \n Hypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with  diabetes , and mainly occurs if someone with diabetes takes too much insulin, misses a meal or exercises too hard. \n In rare cases, it's possible for a person who doesn't have diabetes\u00a0to experience hypoglycaemia. It can be triggered by  malnutrition ,\u00a0 binge drinking  or certain conditions, such as  Addison's disease . \n Read more about the  causes of hypoglycaemia  \n Symptoms of hypoglycaemia \n Most people will have some warning that their blood\u00a0glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre. \n Typical early warning signs are feeling hungry, trembling or shakiness, and sweating. In more severe cases, you may also feel confused and have difficulty concentrating. In very severe cases, a person experiencing hypoglycaemia can lose consciousness. \n It's also possible for hypoglycaemia to occur during sleep, which can cause excess sweating, disturbed sleep, and feeling tired and confused upon waking. \n Read more about the  symptoms of hypoglycaemia  \n Correcting hypoglycaemia \n The immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels. \n After having something sugary, you may need to have a longer-acting \"starchy\" carbohydrate food, such as\u00a0a sandwich or a\u00a0few biscuits. \n If hypoglycaemia causes a loss of consciousness, an injection of the hormone glucagon can be given to raise blood glucose levels and restore consciousness. This is only\u00a0if an injection is available and the person giving the injection knows how to use it. \n You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if: \n \n a glucagon injection kit isn't available \n there's nobody trained to give the injection \n the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes \n \n Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who's drowsy or unconscious\u00a0as they could choke.\u00a0This includes some of the high-sugar preparations specifically designed for smearing inside the cheek. \n Read more about  treating hypoglycaemia  \n Preventing hypoglycaemia \n If you have diabetes that requires treatment with insulin, the safest way\u00a0to avoid hypoglycaemia is to regularly check your blood sugar and learn to recognise the early symptoms. \n Missing meals or snacks or eating less carbohydrate than planned can increase your risk of hypoglycaemia. You should be careful when drinking  alcohol \u00a0as it can also\u00a0cause hypoglycaemia, sometimes many hours after drinking. \n Exercise or activity is another potential cause, and you should have a\u00a0plan for dealing with this, such as eating carbohydrate before, during or after exercise, or adjusting your insulin dose. \n You should also make sure you regularly change where you inject insulin\u00a0as the amount of insulin your body absorbs can differ depending on where it's injected. \n Always carry rapid-acting carbohydrate\u00a0with you, such as glucose tablets, a carton of fruit juice (one that contains sugar), or some sweets in case you feel symptoms coming on or your blood glucose level is low. \n Make sure your friends and family know about your diabetes and the risk of hypoglycaemia. It may also help to carry some form of identification that lets people know about your condition in an emergency. \n When hypoglycaemia occurs as the result of\u00a0an underlying condition other than diabetes, the condition will need to be treated to prevent a further hypo. \n Read more about\u00a0 preventing hypoglycaemia", "symptoms": "The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually begin when your blood glucose level drops below four millimoles (mmol) per litre. \n If you have  diabetes ,\u00a0particularly if it's treated with insulin, you may be advised to use a small device called a blood glucose meter to\u00a0regularly check your blood glucose levels. \n Symptoms can vary from person to person, and it's important to be aware of the early warning signs so you can treat them. \n Signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia can include: \n \n feeling hungry \n sweating \n dizziness \n tiredness (fatigue) \n blurred vision \n trembling or shakiness \n going pale \n fast pulse or\u00a0 palpitations  \n tingling lips \n irritability \n difficulty concentrating \n confusion \n disorderly or irrational behaviour, which may be mistaken for drunkenness \n \n If hypoglycaemia isn't treated promptly and your blood glucose levels drop low enough, you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness. \n Most people with insulin-treated diabetes notice that the symptoms of hypoglycaemia change and become less obvious the longer they live with the condition. \n For some people, the warning symptoms become greatly reduced, putting them at significant risk of having severe episodes where they're dependent on others for help. \n Let your diabetes care team know if you develop this problem\u00a0as your treatment may need to be changed to reduce the risk. \n Read more about  how hypoglycaemia is treated  \n Hypoglycaemia while sleeping \n Having a\u00a0hypo while you're asleep is known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia. It's more common in people who treat diabetes with insulin. \n Although some people find their sleep is disturbed when they experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia,\u00a0you may only notice the symptoms when you wake up in the morning. \n The symptoms of\u00a0nocturnal hypoglycaemia can include: \n \n  headache \u00a0\u2013\u00a0often likened to having a hangover \n feeling unusually tired in the morning \n damp sheets or clothing from sweating", "causes": "In most cases, hypoglycaemia affects people with  diabetes , although more rarely it can also occur as a result of other underlying conditions. \n Hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes \n Overdose of diabetes medication \n A common cause of hypoglycaemia is taking too much insulin for your current needs. Insulin is a medication that helps control your blood glucose levels. It's commonly used to treat\u00a0 type 1 diabetes \u00a0and is also recommended for some\u00a0people with\u00a0 type 2 diabetes . \n A fall in blood\u00a0glucose levels can also occur after taking too much oral hypoglycaemia medication, such as sulphonylurea, which causes a release of insulin. This medication is often used\u00a0to lower blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. \n Exercise, food and alcohol \n For people with type 1 diabetes, maintaining the correct blood glucose level involves balancing\u00a0how much\u00a0insulin you inject, the amount of food you eat, and how much energy you burn during exercise. \n Hypoglycaemia may occur if you've taken your dose of insulin as usual, but your carbohydrate intake is lower than normal or has been used up more quickly. This may happen if you delay or miss a meal or snack, don't eat enough carbohydrate, or exercise more than usual. \n People with diabetes who've\u00a0drunk too much alcohol, or drank alcohol on an empty stomach, can also get hypoglycaemia. \n However, it's not always possible to identify why a particular episode of hypoglycaemia has occurred, and sometimes it happens for no obvious reason. \n Hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes \n Hypoglycaemia\u00a0\u2013 even mild cases\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is very rare in people who don't have diabetes. The possible causes are outlined below. \n Reactive hypoglycaemia \n People without diabetes can sometimes experience hypoglycaemia if their pancreas produces too much insulin after a large carbohydrate-based meal. This is known as reactive hypoglycaemia. \n It's not clear why this happens, although it's thought to be more common in people who are overweight or have had gastric bypass surgery. \n In rare cases, a benign (non-cancerous) tumour in the pancreas may cause an overproduction of insulin, or the tumour itself may use up too much glucose. \n Other possible causes \n Other possible causes of hypoglycaemia in people without diabetes are: \n \n fasting or  malnutrition  \u2013 where not enough nutrients are consumed for your body to function properly \n  binge drinking \u00a0or heavy drinking of alcohol \n  Addison's disease  \u2013 a disorder of the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys)\u00a0 \n certain medication \u2013 hypoglycaemia has been known to occur in people taking quinine (for  malaria ), salicylates (for rheumatic disease) and propranolol (for  high blood pressure ) \n severe illnesses affecting the liver, kidneys or thyroid gland", "treatment": "In most cases, you can treat hypoglycaemia yourself when you recognise the symptoms. \n Treating an episode of hypoglycaemia \n The immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some sugary food or drink (about 15 to 20g of rapidly acting carbohydrate) to end the attack. \n For example, this could be: \n \n a glass of fruit juice or non-diet soft drink \n between three and five dextrose tablets \n a handful of sweets \n \n At first you should avoid fatty foods and drinks, such as chocolate and milk, because they don't usually contain as much sugar and the sugar they do contain may be absorbed more slowly. \n After having something sugary, you should have a longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar, a piece of fruit or a sandwich. \n It will usually take around 15 minutes to recover from a mild episode of hypoglycaemia. If you have a blood glucose meter, measure your blood sugar again after 15 to 20 minutes. If it's still too low (below 4mmol), you should have some more sugary food or a drink before testing\u00a0your levels\u00a0again in another 15 to 20\u00a0minutes. \n When treating someone else with hypoglycaemia, if the above treatment isn't effective, you may be able to help them by applying glucose gel (or honey, treacle or jam if glucose gel isn't\u00a0available) to the inside of their cheeks, and gently massaging the outside of their cheeks. \n It may take 10 to 15 minutes before they feel better. This shouldn't be done if the person is drowsy or unconscious because of the risk of choking. \n If you have several episodes of hypoglycaemia a week, you should contact your diabetes care team to find out the underlying cause. Your medication may need to be adjusted, or there may be another condition causing hypoglycaemia that needs to be treated. \n If a person is unconscious \n If a person loses consciousness\u00a0because of\u00a0severe hypoglycaemia, they need to be put into the\u00a0 recovery position  and given an injection of the hormone glucagon\u00a0(if they have an injection kit). The injection will raise their blood glucose level. \n The injection should be carried out by a friend or family member who knows what they're doing, or by a trained healthcare professional. \n You should dial 999 to request an ambulance if: \n \n a glucagon injection kit isn't available \n there's nobody available who's trained to give the injection \n the injection is ineffective after 10 minutes \n \n Never try to put food or drink into the mouth of someone who's unconscious as\u00a0they could choke. \n If you're able to give a glucagon injection and the person regains consciousness, they should\u00a0eat some longer-acting carbohydrate food, such as a few biscuits, a cereal bar or a sandwich. \n You should continue to monitor the person for signs of recurring symptoms\u00a0in case they need to be treated again.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It's not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment or within a few weeks without treatment. \n Impetigo\u00a0is the most common skin infection in young children in the UK, but it can affect people of all ages. \n This topic covers: \n  Symptoms  \n  When to seek medical advice  \n  Causes  \n  Treatment  \n  Preventing the spread of impetigo  \n  Preventing recurrent impetigo  \n  Complications  \n Symptoms of impetigo \n There are two types of impetigo: \n \n non-bullous impetigo \u2013 the most common type \n bullous impetigo \n \n The symptoms of\u00a0both types\u00a0are described\u00a0below. \n Non-bullous impetigo \n The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores \u2013 usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. \n The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin. \n After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks. \n The sores aren't painful, but they may be itchy. It's important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people. \n Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and  swollen glands , are rare but can occur in more severe cases. \n Bullous impetigo \n The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1-2cm across. \n The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring. \n The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it's important not to\u00a0touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin. \n Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo. \n When to seek\u00a0medical advice \n Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have symptoms of impetigo. \n Impetigo isn't usually serious, but it can sometimes have similar symptoms to more serious conditions such as  cellulitis \u00a0(an infection of the deeper layers of skin) so it's important to get a correct diagnosis. \n Your GP can also prescribe treatment to help clear up the infection more quickly than if it\u00a0was left untreated. \n Causes of impetigo \n Impetigo occurs when the skin becomes infected with bacteria, usually either\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus or\u00a0Streptococcus pyogenes. \n The bacteria can infect the skin in two main ways: \n \n through a break in otherwise healthy skin\u00a0\u2013 such as a  cut ,\u00a0 insect bite  or other injury\u00a0\u2013 this is known as primary impetigo \n through skin damaged by another underlying skin condition, such as  head lice ,  scabies  or  eczema  \u2013 this is known as secondary impetigo \n \n The bacteria can be spread easily through close contact with someone who has the infection, such as through direct physical contact, or by sharing towels or flannels. \n As the condition doesn't cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria, it's often easily spread to others unintentionally. \n Children and people\u00a0with\u00a0 diabetes \u00a0or a weakened immune system \u2013\u00a0either due to a condition such as  HIV  or a treatment such as  chemotherapy \u00a0\u2013 are most at risk of developing impetigo. \n Treating impetigo \n Impetigo\u00a0usually gets better without treatment in around two to three weeks. \n However, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days and can\u00a0lower the\u00a0risk of the infection being spread to others. \n The main treatments prescribed are\u00a0 antibiotic  creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for around a week. \n Read about  treating impetigo . \n Preventing the spread of impetigo \n During treatment, it's important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or to other areas of the body. \n Most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed. It's important to\u00a0stay away from work, school, nursery or playgroup until this\u00a0point. \n The advice below can also\u00a0help to prevent the spread of the infection: \n \n don't share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo \u2013 wash them at a high temperature after use \n wash the sores with soap and water and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing \n avoid\u00a0touching or scratching the sores, or letting others touch them\u00a0\u2013 it may help to ensure your nails are kept clean and short \n avoid contact with newborn babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym\u00a0\u2013 until the risk of infection has passed \n wash your hands frequently\u00a0\u2013 particularly after touching infected skin \n washable toys should also be washed\u00a0\u2013 wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely \n \n If you think that the infection has spread to someone else, make sure they're seen by a GP as soon as possible. \n Preventing recurrent\u00a0impetigo \n To\u00a0reduce the risk of impetigo returning, make sure any cuts, scratches or bites are kept clean. Ensure any condition that causes broken skin, such as eczema, is treated promptly. \n If you develop impetigo frequently, your doctor may suggest taking a swab from around your nose to see if you carry staphylococcal bacteria. These bacteria can live in the noses of some people without causing problems, although they can lead to impetigo if they infect broken skin nearby. \n If you're found to carry these bacteria,\u00a0you may be prescribed an antiseptic\u00a0nasal cream to apply several times a day for five to 10 days in an attempt to clear the bacteria and reduce the chances of impetigo recurring. \n Complications of impetigo \n Complications of impetigo are rare, but they can sometimes occur and can be serious. Tell your GP\u00a0if you have impetigo and your symptoms change or get worse. \n Some complications associated with impetigo include: \n \n  cellulitis \u00a0\u2013 an infection of the deeper layers of the skin and underlying tissue \n  scarlet fever \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a rare bacterial infection that causes a fine, pink rash across the body \n guttate\u00a0 psoriasis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a non-infectious skin condition that can develop in children and teenagers after a bacterial infection \n septicaemia (a type of  sepsis )\u00a0\u2013 a bacterial infection of the blood \n Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a serious skin condition that looks like the skin has been scalded with boiling water \n post-streptococcal\u00a0glomerulonephritis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the small blood vessels in the kidneys \n \n In very rare cases,\u00a0impetigo may lead to some scarring, particularly if you scratch at the blisters, crusts or sores.", "symptoms": "Impetigo does not cause any symptoms until four to 10 days after you first become infected. This means that people can easily pass the infection on to others without realising it. \n There are two main types of impetigo, known as non-bullous and bullous impetigo, which have different symptoms. Most people with impetigo have the non-bullous type. \n The symptoms of non-bullous and bullous impetigo are described\u00a0below. \n Non-bullous impetigo \n The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores \u2013 usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected. \n The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar)", "introduction": "Hyperglycaemia is the medical term for a high blood sugar (glucose) level. It's a common problem for people with  diabetes . \n It can affect people with\u00a0 type 1 diabetes  and  type 2 diabetes , as well as pregnant women with gestational diabetes. \n It can occasionally affect people who don't have diabetes, but usually only people who are seriously ill, such as those who have recently had a  stroke  or  heart attack , or have a severe infection. \n Hyperglycaemia shouldn't be confused with  hypoglycaemia , which is when a person's blood sugar level drops too low. \n This information focuses on hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes. \n Is\u00a0hyperglycaemia serious? \n The aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as near to normal as possible. But if you have diabetes, no matter how careful you are, you're likely to experience hyperglycaemia at some point. \n It's important to be able to recognise and treat hyperglycaemia, as it can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. \n Occasional mild episodes aren't usually a cause for concern and can be treated quite easily or may return to normal on their own. However, hyperglycaemia can be potentially dangerous if blood sugar levels become very high or stay high for long periods. \n Very high blood sugar levels can cause life-threatening complications, such as: \n \n diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)\u00a0\u2013 a condition caused by the body needing to break down fat as a source of energy, which can lead to a diabetic coma; this tends to affect people with type 1 diabetes \n hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS)\u00a0\u2013 severe\u00a0 dehydration  caused by the body\u00a0trying to get rid of excess sugar; this tends to affect people with type 2 diabetes \n \n Regularly having high blood sugar levels for long periods of time (over months or years) can result in permanent damage to parts of the body such as the eyes, nerves, kidneys and blood vessels. \n If you experience hyperglycaemia regularly, speak to your doctor or diabetes care team. You may need to change your treatment or lifestyle to keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy range. \n Symptoms of hyperglycaemia \n Symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes\u00a0tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high. \n Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include: \n \n increased\u00a0 thirst  and a\u00a0 dry mouth  \n needing to\u00a0pee frequently \n tiredness \n blurred vision \n unintentional\u00a0weight loss \n recurrent infections, such as thrush,\u00a0 bladder infections (cystitis)  and skin infections \n \n Symptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your GP if this applies to you.

The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. \n The majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). \n In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be\u00a0triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress\u00a0or taking certain medications. \n Read more about the  causes of indigestion . \n Treating indigestion at home \n Most people are able to\u00a0treat indigestion with simple changes to their\u00a0diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids. \n Read more about the  treatment of indigestion . \n Read how to ease  indigestion in pregnancy . \n Very rarely,\u00a0a serious\u00a0underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion.

Indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the \"stretching\" caused by eating. \n Indigestion can also be triggered or made worse\u00a0by other factors. Some of these are explained below. \n Medications \n You may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. Some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up. \n Other medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ), can affect your digestive tract and cause\u00a0indigestion. \n Do\u00a0not take NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as a\u00a0 stomach ulcer , or have had this in the past. Children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin. \n Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are\u00a0told to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care. \n Obesity \n If you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen).\u00a0 \n The increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus. \n Stress or anxiety \n If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion. \n Read\u00a0some relaxation tips to relieve stress. \n Hiatus hernia \n A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall. \n A\u00a0 hiatus hernia  occurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs).\u00a0It may partially block refluxed stomach\u00a0acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn. \n Helicobacter pylori infection \n Helicobacter infection is very common. It may lead to stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer. In most cases, however, it\u00a0does not cause any symptoms at all. \n Some people may get bouts of indigestion from helicobacter infection and, in these cases, getting rid of the bug with antibiotics (eradication) will help. However, many cases of indigestion are not caused by helicobacter, and in these cases eradication will not get rid of symptoms. \n Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \n  Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \u00a0is a common condition and one of the main causes of recurring indigestion. It's caused by acid reflux, which\u00a0occurs when the oesophageal sphincter fails to prevent stomach acid from moving back up into your oesophagus. \n A little bit of acid reflux is normal and rarely cause any symptoms. It becomes GORD when large amounts of reflux occur, and the sensitive lining of your oesophagus may get inflamed by repeated irritation from stomach acid. This can lead to heartburn, the sensation of regurgitation or painful swallowing. \n Stomach\u00a0ulcers \n A\u00a0 stomach ulcer  is an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). If you have a\u00a0stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom. \n Stomach\u00a0ulcers form\u00a0when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. In most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an H pylori infection (see above). \n Stomach cancer \n In rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom of\u00a0 stomach cancer . \n Cancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall.", "treatment": "Treatment for indigestion (dyspepsia) will vary, depending on what is causing it and how severe your symptoms are. \n If you have been diagnosed with an underlying health condition, you may want to read our information on: \n \n  treating gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)  \n  treating a\u00a0stomach ulcer  \n \n Diet and lifestyle changes \n If you only have indigestion occasionally, you may not need to see your GP for treatment. It may be possible to ease your symptoms by making a few simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, summarised below. \n Healthy weight \n Being overweight puts more pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to be pushed back up into your gullet (oesophagus). This is known as acid reflux, and is one of the most common causes of indigestion. \n If you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. Read advice on  losing weight . \n Stop smoking \n If you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux. \n Read more about\u00a0 quitting smoking , or speak to your GP or pharmacist. You can also call the  Quit Your Way Scotland \u00a0service on 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day). \n Diet and alcohol \n Make a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. This may mean: \n \n eating less rich, spicy and fatty foods \n cutting down on drinks that contain caffeine \u2013 such as tea, coffee and cola \n avoiding or cutting down on alcohol \n \n At bedtime \n If you tend to experience indigestion symptoms at night, avoid eating for three to four hours before you go to bed. Going to bed with a full stomach means there is an increased risk that acid in your stomach will be forced up into your oesophagus while you are lying down. \n When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up or, ideally,\u00a0raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope that is created should help to prevent stomach acid moving up into your oesophagus while you are asleep. \n Stress or anxiety \n If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion. \n Read some  relaxation tips to relieve stress . \n Changing current medication \n Your GP may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion. \n As long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Where possible, your GP will prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. However, never stop taking any medication without consulting your GP first. \n Immediate indigestion relief \n If you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your GP can advise you about the best way to treat this. As well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your GP may prescribe or recommend: \n \n antacid medicines \n alginates \n \n These are described in more detail below. \n Antacids \n Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief for mild to moderate symptoms of indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic), so that it no longer irritates the lining of your digestive system. \n Antacids are available in tablet and liquid form. You can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription. \n The effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. Always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much. \n It is best to take antacids when you are expecting symptoms of indigestion, or when they start to occur, such as: \n \n after meals \n at bedtime \n \n This is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. For example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. In comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes. \n Read more\u00a0about\u00a0antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects. \n Alginates \n Some antacids also contain a medicine\u00a0called an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux. \n Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. Alginates\u00a0form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus. \n Your GP may suggest that you take an antacid that contains an alginate if you experience symptoms of acid reflux or if you have GORD. \n Take antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. If you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective. \n Treating persistent indigestion \n If you have indigestion that is persistent or recurring, treatment with antacids and alginates may not be effective enough to control your symptoms. Your GP may prescribe a different type of medication, which will\u00a0be prescribed at the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms. Possible medications include: \n \n proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \n H2-receptor antagonists \n \n These are described in more detail below. Your GP may also test you for the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria (see  Indigestion \u2013 diagnosis ) and prescribe treatment for this if necessary. \n Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \n PPIs restrict the acid produced in your stomach. \n The medication is\u00a0taken as tablets and is generally only available with a prescription. If you are over 18, you can buy some types of PPIs over the counter in pharmacies, but these should only be used for short-term treatment. If your ingestion is persistent, see your GP. \n PPIs may enhance the effect of certain medicines. If you are prescribed a PPI, your progress will be monitored if you are also taking other medicines, such as: \n \n warfarin \u2013 a medicine that stops the blood clotting \n phenytoin \u2013 a medicine to treat epilepsy \n \n If your GP refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a PPI at least 14 days before the procedure. This is because PPIs can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy. \n PPIs can sometimes cause side effects. However, they are usually mild and reversible. These side effects may include: \n \n headaches \n diarrhoea \n constipation \n feeling sick (nausea) \n vomiting \n flatulence \n stomach pain \n dizziness \n skin rashes \n \n H2-receptor antagonists \n H2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your GP may suggest if antacids, alginates and PPIs have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. There are four H2-receptor antagonists: \n \n cimetidine\u00a0 \n famotidine\u00a0 \n nizatidine\u00a0 \n ranitidine\u00a0 \n \n These medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach. \n Your GP may prescribe any one of these four H2-receptor antagonists, although famotidine and ranitidine are available to buy over the counter in pharmacies. H2-receptor antagonists are taken either in tablet or liquid form. \n As with PPIs, you will need to stop taking H2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy. This is\u00a0because they can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy. \n Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection \n If your indigestion symptoms are caused by an infection with H pylori bacteria, you will need to have treatment to clear the infection from your stomach. This should help relieve your indigestion, because the H pylori bacteria will no longer be increasing the amount of acid in your stomach. \n H pylori infection is usually treated using triple therapy (treatment with three different medications). Your GP will prescribe a course of treatment containing: \n \n two different antibiotics (medicines to treat infections that are caused by bacteria) \n a PPI \n \n You will need to take these medicines twice a day for seven days. You must follow the dosage instructions closely to ensure that the triple therapy is effective. \n In up to 85% of cases, one course of triple therapy is effective in clearing an H pylori infection. However, you may need to have more than one course of treatment if it does not clear the infection the first time.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "For most people, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and infrequent, and does not require treatment from a healthcare professional. \n However, if you have indigestion regularly, or if it causes you severe pain or discomfort, see your GP.\u00a0 \n They will ask about your indigestion symptoms, as well as: \n \n any other symptoms you have \u2013 which\u00a0may indicate an underlying health condition \n any medication you are taking \u2013 as some medications can cause indigestion \n your lifestyle \u2013 as some lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol or being overweight, can cause indigestion\u00a0 \n \n Your GP may also\u00a0press gently on different areas of your stomach (abdomen) to establish whether or not this is painful. \n Depending on the type of indigestion symptoms you have, your GP may want to investigate your condition further. This is because indigestion can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or health problem, such as a Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacterial infection. \n Details of some of the further investigations you may have are outlined below. \n Further investigations \n Endoscopy \n You may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy. \n An endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope \u2013 a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. The camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a\u00a0TV monitor. \n An endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your GP may suggest that you have one if: \n \n they need to examine the inside of your abdomen in more detail \n you have had treatment for indigestion that has not worked \n you have any\u00a0 serious symptoms of indigestion \u00a0 \n \n Read more\u00a0about having an\u00a0endoscopy. \n Taking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. Therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. \n Read more about\u00a0 treatments for indigestion . \n Your GP may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. However, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care.\u00a0 \n Diagnosing H pylori infection \n If your GP thinks that your symptoms may be due to an infection with H pylori bacteria, you may need to have a test for it, such as: \n \n a stool antigen test \u2013 a pea-sized stool (faeces) sample will be tested for H pylori bacteria \n a breath test \n a  blood test  \u2013 a blood sample will be tested for antibodies to H pylori bacteria (antibodies are proteins produced by the body to fight infection) \n \n  Antibiotics \u00a0and PPIs can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. Therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a PPI, and four weeks after you last used an antibiotic. \n Diagnosing other conditions \n If your GP thinks that your indigestion symptoms may be caused by another underlying medical condition, you may need to have some further tests to rule this out. \n For example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. Your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. If your GP thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working. \n You may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. An  ultrasound scan  uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body."},

Normally cells in our body divide and grow in a controlled way. But sometimes cells keep dividing and grow out of control. This is how cancer develops. \n In lymphomas, white blood cells called lymphocytes become abnormal and grow out of control. These lymphocytes can build up in one part of the body and form a lump (tumour). \n There are two main types of lymphoma: \n \n  Hodgkin lymphoma  \n  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) \u00a0 \n \n Although these cancers are both lymphomas, they are different and need different treatments. Your doctors will do tests to find out which type you have. \n Symptoms \n One of the most common symptoms is having a painless lump. The lump is caused by swollen lymph nodes. There may be one or more lumps and these may be in your neck, armpit or groin. \n Lumps can also be inside the body. A common place would be inside the chest and this can cause a cough or breathlessness. \n Some people feel tired and lethargic with lymphoma. Itching of the skin is also quite common. \n Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma have other symptoms such as high temperatures, very heavy sweats (especially at night) and unexplained weight loss. Doctors call these symptoms \u2018B symptoms\u2019. \n Most of the symptoms that people get with lymphoma may also be caused by other illnesses. For example swollen lymph nodes, high temperatures and sweats may be caused by an infection. But if you have any of these symptoms or are worried that you may have Hodgkin lymphoma, go to your GP. They'll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor. \n Causes \n We don't know what causes Hodgkin lymphoma, but research is going on to try to find out. Remember, though, it isn't anything that you\u2019ve done. \n Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in young people over the age of 10. About 1 in 6 of all cancers affecting young people between 15 and 24 is a Hodgkin lymphoma. \n Hodgkin lymphoma isn\u2019t infectious and can\u2019t be passed on to other people or family members. \n If you\u2019re looking for information about Hodgkin lymphoma in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0 Hodgkin lymphoma  section.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Huntington's disease", "introduction": "Huntington's disease is an inherited condition that damages certain nerve cells in the brain. \n This brain damage gets progressively worse over time and can affect movement, cognition (perception, awareness, thinking, judgement) and behaviour. \n Early features can include personality changes, mood swings, fidgety movements, irritability and altered behaviour, although these are often overlooked and attributed to something else. \n Read more about\u00a0the  features of Huntington's disease  \n Huntington's disease was\u00a0originally called Huntington's chorea (\"chorea\" is the Greek word for dancing). This is because the involuntary movements associated with the condition can look like jerky dancing.\u00a0However, \"disease\" is now the preferred term, because the condition involves a lot more than just abnormal movements. \n Huntington's disease is caused by an inherited faulty gene. However, in around 3% of cases, there's no family history of the condition, normally because the parents died at a young age. \n Read more about  the cause of Huntington's disease  \n Diagnosing Huntington's disease \n If you have symptoms of Huntington's disease, your GP will refer you to a\u00a0specialist\u00a0clinician (usually a neurologist) if they feel your symptoms need further investigation. \n The specialist will ask about your symptoms to assess how likely it is that\u00a0you have Huntington's disease and to rule out similar conditions. \n They may also test a number of physical functions, such as your eye movements, balance, control, movement and walking. Your speech and cognition may also be tested. All of these can be affected by Huntington's disease. \n Genetic testing can be used\u00a0to confirm the diagnosis. \n Read more about  how Huntington's disease is diagnosed  \n Treating Huntington's disease \n There's no cure for Huntington's disease and its progress can't be reversed or slowed down. \n As the\u00a0condition progresses,\u00a0it may\u00a0put a strain on family and relationships. Treatments for Huntington's disease\u00a0aim to improve any mood disturbance; this is done to\u00a0maintain skills used in daily living that can deteriorate over time. \n Medication can help manage some of the symptoms, such as irritability or excessive movement. Therapies such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy can help with communication and day-to-day living. \n Support is also available for the\u00a0family of a person with Huntington's disease. This includes, for example, testing family members who don't have any of the condition's features (manifest) to see whether they carry\u00a0the gene, or help with choosing a suitable care home in advanced cases. \n Read more about  how Huntington's disease is treated \u00a0and  living with Huntington's disease  \n Huntington's disease usually progresses and gets worse over a 10-25 year period from when it first appears, before\u00a0the person eventually dies from it. During the condition's later stages, the person will be totally dependent and need full nursing care. \n Death is usually from a secondary cause, such as  heart failure ,\u00a0 pneumonia  or another infection. \n Who's affected by Huntington's disease? \n Both men and women\u00a0with a family history of Huntington's disease\u00a0can inherit\u00a0the condition. Symptoms usually start to\u00a0appear during adulthood.\u00a0 \n Juvenile (children's) Huntington's disease develops before the age of\u00a020. Only\u00a05-10% of people with Huntington's disease develop it at a very young age, and the pattern of features may be different. \n It was previously thought\u00a0that 4-6\u00a0people in a population of 100,000 were\u00a0affected by Huntington's disease. However, UK research carried out in 2012 found the actual figure for those affected by the condition to be about 12\u00a0people per 100,000.\u00a0\u00a0 \n It's thought that the number of people who have the Huntington's gene and are not yet affected is about twice that of those who have symptoms. \n Current research \n Research is underway to find disease-modifying medication and new treatments for the  features of Huntington's disease . \n Exciting progress has been made in identifying potential ways of slowing down or halting the condition by \"switching off\" the faulty gene that causes Huntington's disease. \n Find out more by visiting the  European Huntington's Disease Network  \n Information about you \n If you have\u00a0Huntington's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Huntington's disease is caused by a faulty gene that runs in families. \n Genes and chromosomes \n Genes are the instructions for making all parts of the human body and brain. They're made up of DNA and packaged onto strands called chromosomes. We have two copies of all our genes,\u00a0so our chromosomes are in pairs. \n Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). The faulty gene that causes Huntington's disease is found on chromosome number four. \n The normal copy of the gene produces a protein called huntingtin, but the faulty gene contains an abnormal region of what are called CAG repeats. This area is\u00a0larger than normal and produces a mutant form of huntingtin.\u00a0 \n Cells in parts of the brain \u2013 specifically, the basal ganglia and parts of the cortex \u2013 are very sensitive to the effects of the abnormal huntingtin. This makes them\u00a0function poorly and eventually die.\u00a0 \n The brain normally sends messages through the basal ganglia and cortex to control movement and thinking, as well as motivation. If this\u00a0part of the brain\u00a0is damaged, it causes problems with\u00a0control of movement, behaviour and thinking. \n It's still unclear exactly how abnormal huntingtin affects the brain cells and why some are more sensitive than others. \n Inheriting Huntington's disease \n A parent with the Huntington's disease gene has one good copy of the gene and one faulty copy. Their child will inherit one of these genes. Therefore, there's a 50:50 chance that the child will get the faulty gene and develop Huntington's disease. \n However, it's very difficult to predict how old the child will be when they develop the condition if they inherit the abnormal gene, unless it contains a very long CAG repeat (&gt;55). \n There's also\u00a0a 50:50 chance that the child with Huntington's disease will pass the faulty gene on to a child they may have in the future. This pattern of inheritance is called \"autosomal dominant\". \n In around 3% of cases of Huntington's disease, there's no obvious family history of the condition. This could be due to adoption or because relatives with the condition died early from other causes. In rare cases, it's due to a new expansion in the gene.", "treatment": "There's no cure for Huntington's disease. Its progress can't be reversed or slowed down, although this is the goal of many research projects. \n Some of the\u00a0 features of Huntington's disease  can be managed with medication and therapies, which may be coordinated by specialist teams. \n Therapies, such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, can help with communication and day-to-day living. \n  Regular exercise \u00a0is also very important. People who are active tend to feel much better physically and mentally than those who don't exercise. Someone with Huntington's disease may have poor coordination, but walking independently, with the use of walking aids if necessary, can make all the difference. \n Read more about  managing lifestyle issues, such as feeding and communication  \n Medication for Huntington's disease \n Medicines for Huntington's disease, which\u00a0can be taken in liquid form in many cases if needed, are described below. \n Most of these medications have side effects, such as extreme tiredness. However, it may sometimes be difficult to tell whether these are symptoms of the condition\u00a0or a result of the medication. \n Antidepressants to treat depression \n  Antidepressants \u00a0can help\u00a0improve mood swings and treat  depression . They include: \n \n SSRI antidepressants \u2013 such as fluoxetine, citalopram and\u00a0paroxetine \n tricyclic antidepressants \u2013 such as\u00a0amitriptyline \n other types of antidepressants \u2013 including mirtazapine,\u00a0duloxetine and\u00a0venlafaxine \n \n Side effects of antidepressants may include: \n \n  constipation  \n sweating \n shaking or trembling \n difficulty sleeping ( insomnia ) \n \n Mood stabilisers to treat irritability or mood swings \n Mood stabilisers, particularly carbamazepine,\u00a0may be considered as a treatment for irritability.\u00a0Olanzapine can also help, along with sodium valproate and lamotrigine. \n The dose of carbamazepine needs to be slowly increased and any side effects monitored. Carbamazepine can't be used during\u00a0pregnancy. \n Medication to suppress involuntary movements \n The medications listed below suppress the involuntary movements \u2013 or chorea \u2013 seen in Huntington's disease. In the UK, antipsychotic medicines are usually preferred. \n \n antipsychotic medication \u2013 such as olanzapine, sulpiride,\u00a0risperidone and\u00a0quetiapine \n tetrabenazine \u2013 reduces the\u00a0amount of dopamine reaching some of the nerve cells in the brain \n benzodiazepines \u2013 such as\u00a0clonazepam and\u00a0diazepam \n \n Antipsychotic medication may also help control delusions and violent outbursts. However, they may have severe side effects, such as: \n \n stiffness and rigidity \n sedation \n tremor (shaking) \n moving slowly \n \n Due to the possibility of experiencing these side effects, the lowest possible dose of antipsychotics are normally prescribed in the first instance.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have features of Huntington's disease, your GP will refer you to a clinician with specialist expertise in the condition if they feel further investigation is needed. \n Many areas have Huntington's disease management clinics with a range of specialists, including a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord). \n The specialist will ask\u00a0about your symptoms, such as whether you've had\u00a0recent emotional problems, to see if it's likely you have Huntington's disease and to\u00a0rule out similar conditions. \n They may also examine you and test your thinking, eye movements, balance, walking, and whether you have any involuntary movements, such as chorea (fidgety or jerky movements). \n Confirming the diagnosis \n People with Huntington's disease often start to experience symptoms a number of years before the condition is actually diagnosed. This is particularly true in cases where someone is unaware that the condition runs in their family. \n If you're showing\u00a0 features of Huntington's disease  and it's known to run in your family, or if your doctor strongly suspects that you have the condition, genetic testing\u00a0can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. \n It's important to realise that the diagnosis is based on\u00a0the doctor recognising a combination of a number of factors \u2013 neurological examination, family history and genetic testing. It's possible to have the gene change and still be healthy. This is known as \"premanifest Huntington's disease\". \n Genetic test \n The children of someone with Huntington's disease can take a genetic test after the age of 18 to see whether they've inherited the faulty gene. If they've inherited the faulty gene, they'll develop Huntington's disease, but it's not possible to work out at what age. \n You can ask your GP or neurologist to arrange an appointment for you at a regional genetic clinic. You'll receive some counselling and then blood samples will be taken. Your DNA will be extracted from the blood samples and analysed to see whether you have inherited the faulty gene. \n You\u00a0may have to wait\u00a0two to four weeks for the test results. \n Brain scan \n In the early stages of Huntington's disease, there may not be any specific changes on the brain scan. A doctor may use a brain scan at any stage of the illness if they're concerned there may be other problems in addition to Huntington's disease. \n A brain scan may involve having a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT scan) \u00a0or\u00a0a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . An MRI scan is more detailed and is more sensitive at picking up changes in the brain. However, it's a more claustrophobic procedure. \n Getting tested in pregnancy \n If you're pregnant and already known to have the Huntington's disease gene, it's possible to have a direct test on the pregnancy at 11 weeks. This needs careful consideration and can be discussed with a genetic counselling team. \n If one half of a couple is at risk of Huntington's disease, but doesn't want to find out whether they have the condition, and the couple would like to have children free of risk, more complex indirect genetic testing is needed. This needs to be discussed with the genetic clinic. One option\u00a0is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (see below). \n Preimplantation genetic diagnosis \n Preimplantation genetic diagnosis can be used when one partner is known to have the faulty gene. This is a direct test. \n It involves\u00a0having\u00a0 in vitro fertilisation (IVF)  treatment, then genetically testing the embryo in a laboratory to see if it has the faulty gene. The embryo will only be placed inside the woman if it\u00a0doesn't have the faulty gene and there's no risk of the baby developing Huntington's disease. \n Preimplantation genetic diagnosis isn't a straightforward procedure, and\u00a0raises a number of issues that need to be considered in detail. \n Should I get tested? \n Not everyone wants to know if they've inherited the faulty gene associated with Huntington's disease. It's a personal choice. \n Some people say they would rather not know because they want to enjoy their life and they may die of other causes before the condition develops. \n Most people have approximately 40 years of a normal healthy life before the condition develops. \n Less than one in five people at risk of Huntington's disease choose to have the genetic test. \n If you're considering genetic testing, it's strongly recommended that you speak to a genetic counsellor first. Your GP can refer you."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "HIV", "introduction": "HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, and weakens your ability to fight infections and disease. It's most commonly caught by having sex without a condom. \n It can also be passed on by sharing infected needles and other injecting equipment, and from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. \n HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the immune system, and weakens\u00a0your\u00a0ability to fight infections and disease. \n There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments to enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. \n AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. With early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV will not go on to develop AIDS. \n How do you get HIV? \n HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person, which includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood, and breast milk. It is a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. \n HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat or urine. \n The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is by anal or vaginal sex without a condom. According to statistics from Public Health England, 95% of those diagnosed with HIV in the UK in 2013 acquired HIV as a result of sexual contact. \n Other ways of getting HIV include: \n \n using a contaminated needle, syringe or other injecting equipment \n transmission from mother to baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding \n \n It's also possible for HIV to spread through oral sex and sharing sex toys, although the chances of this happening are very low. For example, it's estimated that you only have a 1 in 5,000 chance of getting HIV if you give unprotected oral sex to someone with the infection. \n Read more about  what causes HIV  \n Getting tested for HIV \n Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. \n The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. \n It's important to be aware that: \n \n emergency anti-HIV medication called PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) may stop you becoming infected if started within 3\u00a0days of possible exposure to the virus, and starting it as soon as possible is recommended \n an early diagnosis means you can start treatment sooner, which can improve your chances of controlling the condition \n HIV tests may need to be repeated one to three months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the \"window period\"), but you shouldn't wait this long to seek help \n you can get tested in a number of places, including your GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities\u00a0 \n clinic tests can sometimes give you a result in minutes, although it may take a few days to get the result of a more detailed blood test \n home-testing or home-sampling kits are available to buy or order online or from pharmacies \u2013 depending on the type of test you use, your result will be available in a few minutes or a few days \n \n If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. \n Read more about  diagnosing HIV  \n Treating and living with HIV \n Although there is no cure for HIV,  treatments  are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives. \n Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. \n HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV drug very easily, but taking a combination of different drugs makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of 3\u00a0antiretrovirals and it is vital that the medications are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. \n For people living with HIV, taking effective antiretroviral therapy (where the HIV virus is \"undetectable\" in blood tests) will significantly reduce the risk of passing on HIV to sexual partners. It is rare for a pregnant woman living with HIV to transmit it to their babies, provided they receive timely and effective antiretroviral therapy and medical care. \n You will also be encouraged to take regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, stop smoking and have yearly  flu jabs  to minimise the risk of getting serious illnesses. \n Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur. This is known as late-stage HIV infection or AIDS. \n Read more about  living with HIV  \n Preventing HIV \n Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection. \n The best way to\u00a0 prevent HIV  is to  use a condom \u00a0for sex and to never share needles or other injecting equipment (including\u00a0syringes, spoons and swabs). Knowing your HIV status and that of your partner is also important. \n For people with HIV, effective antiretroviral therapy significantly reduces the risk of passing HIV to sexual partners. \n How common is HIV? \n At the end of 2014, there were an estimated 103,700 people in the UK living with HIV. The majority were infected through sex (43,000 gay and bisexual men and 54,100 heterosexuals). \n An estimated 17% of people with HIV (18,100) do not know they are infected. \n Around 1\u00a0in every\u00a0620 people in the UK has HIV, but the 2\u00a0groups with highest rates of HIV are gay and bisexual men (approximately 1 in 20) and Black African heterosexuals (approximately 1 in 56 men and 1 in 22 women). \n The World Health Organization estimates that around 35 million people in the world are living with HIV. The virus is more common in many sub-Saharan African countries.", "symptoms": "Most people who are infected with HIV experience a short, flu-like illness that occurs 2\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks after infection. After this, HIV often causes no symptoms for several years. \n The flu-like illness that often occurs a few weeks after HIV infection is also known as seroconversion illness. It's estimated that up to 80% of people who are infected with HIV experience this illness. \n The most common symptoms are: \n \n fever (raised temperature) \n sore throat \n body rash \n \n Other symptoms can include: \n \n tiredness \n joint pain \n muscle pain \n swollen glands (nodes) \n \n The symptoms usually last 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0weeks but can be longer. They\u00a0are a sign that your immune system is putting up a fight against the virus.\u00a0 \n However, these symptoms\u00a0are most commonly caused by conditions other than HIV, and do not mean you have the virus. \n If you have several of these symptoms, and you think you have been at risk of\u00a0HIV infection within the past few weeks, you should\u00a0get an  HIV\u00a0test . \n After the initial symptoms disappear, HIV will often not cause any further symptoms for many years. During this time, known as\u00a0asymptomatic HIV infection, the virus continues to be active and causes progressive damage to your immune system. This process can take about 10 years, during which you will feel and appear well. \n Once the immune system becomes severely damaged symptoms\u00a0can include: \n \n weight loss \n chronic diarrhoea \n night sweats \n skin problems \n recurrent infections \n serious life-threatening illnesses \n \n Earlier diagnosis and treatment of HIV can prevent these problems. \n Read more about  treating HIV  \n It is recommended you should still take an HIV test if you have put yourself at risk at any time in the past, even if you experience no symptoms. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Terrence Higgins Trust: Stages of HIV infection  \n  HIVaware: symptoms at a glance  \n  nam aidsmap: HIV and AIDS", "causes": "In the UK, most cases of HIV are caused by having sex without a condom with a person who has HIV. \n A person with HIV can\u00a0pass the virus to others whether or not\u00a0they have any symptoms.

It is also possible to catch HIV through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is much lower. \n The risk of HIV transmission through oral sex will be higher if the person giving oral sex has mouth ulcers, sores or bleeding gums and/or if the person receiving oral sex has been recently infected with HIV (and has a lot of the virus in their body) or another sexually transmitted infection. \n The type of sex also makes a difference to the level of risk: \n \n performing oral sex on a man with HIV carries some risk, particularly if he ejaculates (comes) in your mouth \n it is possible to catch HIV by performing oral sex on a woman with HIV, particularly if she is having a period, although this is considered to be extremely low risk \n receiving oral sex from someone who has HIV is also extremely low risk as HIV is not transmitted through saliva \n \n Other risk behaviours \n Other ways\u00a0of getting\u00a0HIV include: \n \n sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment\u00a0 \n from mother to baby before or during birth or by breastfeeding \n sharing sex toys with someone infected with HIV \n healthcare workers accidentally pricking themselves with an\u00a0infected needle (this risk is extremely low) \n blood transfusion (now very rare in the UK, but still a problem in developing countries) \n \n How is HIV transmitted \n HIV is not passed on easily from one person to another. The virus does not spread through the air like cold and flu viruses. \n HIV lives in the blood and in some body fluids. To get HIV, one of these fluids from someone with HIV has to get into your blood. \n The body fluids that contain enough HIV to infect someone are: \n \n semen \n vaginal fluids, including menstrual blood \n breast milk \n blood \n lining inside the anus \n \n Other body fluids, like saliva, sweat or urine, do not contain enough of the virus to infect another person. \n The main ways the virus enters the bloodstream are:\u00a0 \n \n by injecting into the bloodstream (with a contaminated needle or injecting equipment) \n through the thin lining on or inside the anus and genitals \n through the thin lining of the mouth and eyes \n via cuts and sores in the skin \n \n HIV is not passed on through: \n \n kissing \n spitting \n being bitten \n contact with unbroken, healthy skin \n being sneezed on \n sharing baths, towels or cutlery \n using the same toilets or swimming pools \n mouth-to-mouth resuscitation \n contact with animals or insects such as mosquitoes \n \n How HIV infects the body \n HIV infects cells of the immune system, the body\u2019s defence system, causing progressive damage and eventually making it unable to fight off infections. \n The virus enters cells in the\u00a0immune system called CD4 cells + ve lymphocyte cells, which protect the body against various bacteria, viruses and other germs. \n It uses the CD4 cells to make thousands of copies of itself. These copies then leave the CD4 cells, killing them in the process. \n This process continues until eventually the number of CD4 cells, also called your\u00a0CD4 count, drops so low that your immune system stops working. \n This can take about 10 years, during which time you will feel and appear well. \n Find out more about the  symptoms of HIV  \n Who is most at risk? \n People who are at higher\u00a0risk of\u00a0becoming infected with\u00a0HIV include: \n \n men who have had unprotected sex with men \n women who have had sex without a condom with men who have sex with men \n people who have had sex without a condom with a person who has lived or travelled in Africa \n people who inject drugs \n people who have had sex without a condom with somebody who has injected drugs \n people who have caught another sexually transmitted infection \n people who have received a blood transfusion while in Africa, eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, Asia or central and southern America", "treatment": "There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments to enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. \n Emergency HIV drugs \n If you think you have been exposed to the virus within the last 72 hours (3\u00a0days), anti-HIV medication may stop you becoming infected. \n For it to be effective, the medication, called post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP, must be started within 72 hours of coming into contact with the virus. It is only recommended following higher risk exposure, particularly where the sexual partner is known to be positive. \n The quicker PEP is started the better, ideally within hours of coming into contact with HIV. The longer the wait, the less chance of it being effective. \n PEP has been misleadingly popularised as a \u201cmorning-after pill\u201d for HIV \u2013 a reference to the emergency pill women can take to prevent getting pregnant after having unprotected sex. \n But the description is not accurate. PEP is a month-long treatment, which\u00a0may have\u00a0serious side effects and is not guaranteed to work.

This is determined by measuring your levels of CD4+ve lymphocyte cells in your blood.\u00a0These cells are important for fighting infection.\u00a0 \n Treatment is usually recommended to begin when your CD4 cell count falls towards 350 or below, whether or not you have any symptoms.\u00a0In some people with other medical conditions, treatment may be started at higher CD4 cell counts. When to start treatment should be discussed with your doctor. \n The aim of the treatment is to reduce the level of HIV in the blood, allow the immune system to repair itself\u00a0and prevent any HIV-related illnesses. \n If you are on HIV treatment, the level of the virus in your blood is generally very low and it is unlikely that you will pass HIV on to someone else. \n If you have another condition \n If you have also been diagnosed with\u00a0 hepatitis B  or  hepatitis C , it is recommended that\u00a0you start treatment when your CD4 count falls below 500. \n Treatment is recommended to begin at any CD4 count if you are on  radiotherapy  or  chemotherapy  that will suppress your immune system, or if you have been diagnosed with certain other illnesses, including: \n \n  tuberculosis  \n HIV-related nephropathy ( kidney disease ) \n HIV-related neurocognitive (brain) illnesses \n \n Antiretroviral drugs \n HIV is treated with antiretrovirals (ARVs), these work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. \n A combination of ARVs is used because HIV can quickly adapt and become resistant to one single ARV. \n Patients tend to take 3\u00a0or more types of ARV medication. This is\u00a0known as combination therapy or antiretroviral therapy (ART). \n Some antiretroviral drugs have been combined into one pill, known as a \"fixed dose combination\". This means that the most common treatments for people just diagnosed with HIV involve taking just one or two pills a day. \n Different combinations of ARVs work for different people so the medicine you take will be individual to you. \n Once HIV treatment is started, you will probably need to take the medication for the rest of your life. For the treatment to be continuously effective,\u00a0it will need to be taken regularly every day. Not taking ARVs regularly may cause the treatment to fail. \n Many of the medicines used to treat HIV can interact with other medications prescribed by your GP or bought over-the-counter. These include herbal remedies such as St John's Wort, as well as recreational drugs. \n Always check with your HIV\u00a0clinic staff or your GP before taking any other medicines. \n Want to know more? \n \n nam:\u00a0 Anti-HIV drugs (PDF, 1.37Mb)  \n Terrence Higgins Trust:\u00a0 Treatment for HIV  \n HIV i-Base:  Introduction to combination therapy  \n \n Pregnancy \n ARV treatment is available to prevent a pregnant woman from passing HIV to her child. \n Without treatment, there is a 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0chance your baby will\u00a0become infected with\u00a0HIV. With treatment, the risk is less than one in 100. \n Advances in treatment mean there is no increased risk of passing the virus to your baby with a normal delivery. However, for some women, a caesarean section may still be recommended. \n If you have HIV, do not breastfeed your baby because the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. \n If you or your partner has HIV,\u00a0speak to an HIV doctor as there are options for safely conceiving a child without\u00a0putting either of you at risk of infection. \n Missing a dose \n HIV treatment only works if you take your pills regularly every day.

Results are\u00a0usually available within a few days. \n \"Point of care\" test\u00a0\u2013 where a sample of saliva from your mouth or a small\u00a0spot of blood from your finger is taken in a clinic. This sample doesn't need to be sent to a laboratory and the\u00a0result is available within a few minutes. \n Home-sampling kit\u00a0\u2013 where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood\u00a0at home\u00a0and send it off in the post for testing. You'll be contacted by phone or text with your result in a few days. You can buy\u00a0them online or from some pharmacies. \n Home-testing kit\u00a0\u2013 where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood yourself and test it at home. The\u00a0result is available within minutes.\u00a0It's important to check that any test you buy has a CE quality assurance mark and is licensed for sale in the UK, as poor quality HIV self-tests are available from overseas. \n \n If the test finds no sign of infection, your result is \"negative\". If signs of infection are found, the result is \"positive\". \n The full blood test is the most accurate test and can normally give reliable results from 1\u00a0month after infection. The other tests tend to be less accurate and may not give a reliable result for a longer period after exposure to the infection (this is known as the \"window period\"). \n For all these tests, a full blood test should be carried out to confirm the result if the first test is positive. If this test is also positive,\u00a0you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests\u00a0and a discussion about your treatment options."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "introduction": "Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body. \n The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. \n In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. \n The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. \n Read more about the  symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma . \n Who's affected? \n Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected. \n Around 1,900 people are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK each year. \n What causes Hodgkin lymphoma? \n The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if: \n \n you\u00a0have a medical condition that weakens your immune system \n you take immunosuppressant medication \n you've previously been exposed to\u00a0a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus \u2013 which causes  glandular fever  \n \n You also have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had the condition. \n Read more about the  causes of Hodgkin lymphoma . \n How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed \n The only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a\u00a0 biopsy . \n This is a minor surgical procedure where\u00a0a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory. \n Read more about  diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma . \n Treatment and outlook \n Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it's also one of the most easily treated types of cancer. \n Your recommended treatment plan will depend on your general health and age, because many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body.\u00a0How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment. \n The main treatments used are\u00a0 chemotherapy , followed by  radiotherapy  or chemotherapy alone. Surgery isn't generally used as a treatment for the condition. \n Overall,\u00a0around 85% of people with Hodgkin lymphoma live at least five years and most of these will be cured. However, there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future. \n Read more about: \n \n  treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma  \n  complications of Hodgkin lymphoma", "symptoms": "The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. The swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches. \n The swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). Lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight infection. \n However, it's highly unlikely that you have Hodgkin lymphoma if you have  swollen lymph nodes , as these glands often swell\u00a0as a response to infection. \n Other symptoms \n Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include: \n \n night sweats \n unintentional weight loss \n a high temperature (fever) \n a persistent\u00a0 cough  or feeling of  breathlessness  \n persistent itching of the skin all over the body \n \n Other symptoms will depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have  abdominal pain  or  indigestion  \n A few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they're diagnosed. This\u00a0may lead to: \n \n persistent tiredness or fatigue \n an increased risk of infections \n excessive bleeding \u2013 such as  nosebleeds ,\u00a0heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin \n \n In\u00a0some cases, people with Hodgkin lymphoma experience pain in their\u00a0lymph glands when they drink alcohol. \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you\u00a0have any of the above symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection. \n While the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by Hodgkin lymphoma, it is best to get them checked out.", "causes": "Hodgkin lymphoma is caused by a change (mutation) in the DNA of a type of white blood cell called B lymphocytes, although the exact reason why this happens isn't known. \n The DNA gives the cells a basic set of instructions, such as when to grow and reproduce. The mutation in the DNA changes these instructions so the cells keep growing, causing them to multiply uncontrollably. \n The abnormal lymphocytes usually begin to multiply in one or more lymph nodes in a particular area of the body, such as your neck or groin. Over time, it's possible for the abnormal lymphocytes to spread into other parts of your body, such as your: \n \n bone marrow \n spleen \n liver \n skin \n lungs \n \n Who's most at risk? \n While the\u00a0cause of the initial mutation that triggers Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown, a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: \n \n having a medical condition that weakens your immune system, such as  HIV  \n having medical treatment that weakens your immune system \u2013 for example, taking medication to suppress your immune system after\u00a0an organ transplant \n being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \u2013\u00a0a common virus that causes  glandular fever  \n having previously had\u00a0 non-Hodgkin lymphoma , possibly because of treatment with\u00a0 chemotherapy \u00a0or  radiotherapy  \n being very overweight ( obese )\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this may be more of a risk factor in women than men \n \n Hodgkin lymphoma isn't infectious and\u00a0isn't thought to\u00a0run in families. Although your\u00a0risk is\u00a0increased if a first-degree relative (parent, sibling or child) has had lymphoma, it's not clear if this is because of an inherited genetic fault\u00a0or\u00a0lifestyle factors. \n Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, although most cases are diagnosed in people in their early 20s or 70s. The condition is slightly more common in men than women.", "treatment": "Hodgkin lymphoma can usually be treated successfully with chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. \n Your treatment plan \n Your specific treatment plan will depend on your general health and your age, as\u00a0many of the treatments can put a tremendous strain on the body. How far the cancer has spread is also an important factor in determining the best treatment. \n Discussions about your treatment plan will usually take place with several doctors and other health professionals who specialise in different aspects of treating lymphoma. This is known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). \n Your MDT will recommend the best treatment options\u00a0for you. However, you shouldn't be rushed into making a decision about your treatment plan. Before deciding, you may wish to talk to friends, family and your partner. \n Treatment options \n The main treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma are chemotherapy alone, or chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. In a few cases, chemotherapy may be combined with steroid medication. \n Surgery isn't generally used\u00a0to treat the condition, except for the\u00a0 biopsy  used to diagnose it. \n Overall, treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is highly effective and most people with the condition are eventually cured. \n The main treatments you may have are described in more detail below. \n Chemotherapy \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0is a type of cancer treatment where medicine is used to kill cancer cells. This medication can be given in a number of different ways, depending on\u00a0the stage of your cancer. \n If doctors think your cancer is curable, you'll normally receive chemotherapy through a drip directly into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy).\u00a0If a cure is unlikely, you may only need to take chemotherapy tablets to help relieve your symptoms. \n Chemotherapy is usually given over a period of a few months on an outpatient basis, which means you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, there may be times when your symptoms or the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome and a longer hospital stay may be needed. \n Chemotherapy can have several side effects, the most significant of which is potential damage to your bone marrow. This can interfere with the production of healthy blood cells and cause the following problems: \n \n fatigue \n  breathlessness  \n increased vulnerability to infection \n bleeding and bruising more easily \n \n If you experience these problems, treatment may need to be delayed so you can produce more healthy blood cells. Growth factor medicines can also stimulate the production of blood cells. \n Other possible side effects of chemotherapy include: \n \n nausea and vomiting \n  diarrhoea  \n loss of appetite \n  mouth ulcers  \n tiredness \n skin rashes \n hair loss \n infertility, which may be temporary or permanent (see\u00a0 complications of Hodgkin lymphoma  for more information) \n \n Most\u00a0side effects should pass once your treatment has finished.\u00a0Tell your care team if the side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are treatments\u00a0that can help. \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy . \n High-dose chemotherapy \n If regular chemotherapy is unsuccessful or Hodgkin lymphoma returns after treatment, you may have a course of chemotherapy at a higher dose. \n However, this intensive chemotherapy destroys your bone marrow, leading to the problems mentioned above. You'll\u00a0need a stem cell or\u00a0bone marrow transplant\u00a0to replace the damaged bone marrow. \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0is most often used to treat early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where the cancer is only in one part of the body. \n Treatment is normally given in short\u00a0daily sessions, Monday to Friday, over several weeks. You shouldn't have to stay in hospital between appointments. \n Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects. These can vary and will be directly related to the\u00a0part of your body being treated. For example, treatment to your throat can lead to a sore throat, while treatment to the head can lead to hair loss. \n Other common side effects\u00a0include: \n \n tiredness \n nausea and vomiting \n dry mouth \n loss of appetite \n \n Most side effects are temporary,\u00a0but there's a risk of long-term problems, including infertility and permanently darkened skin in the treatment area. \n Read more about: \n \n  side effects of radiotherapy  \n  complications of Hodgkin lymphoma  \n \n Steroid medication \n  Steroid medication \u00a0is sometimes used in combination with chemotherapy as a more intensive treatment for advanced cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, or\u00a0if initial treatment hasn't worked. \n The steroid medication is given intravenously, usually at the same time as your chemotherapy. \n Common side effects of steroid medication include: \n \n increased appetite, which can lead to weight gain \n  indigestion  \n problems sleeping \n feeling agitated \n \n The side effects of steroid medication usually start to improve once treatment finishes. \n Rituximab \n If you're diagnosed with a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma called lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, you may have chemotherapy in combination with a medication called rituximab. \n Rituximab is a type of\u00a0biological therapy\u00a0called a monoclonal antibody. It\u00a0attaches itself to the surface of cancerous cells and stimulates the immune system to attack and kill the cell. \n It's given through a drip directly into a vein over the course of a few hours. \n Side effects of the drug can include: \n \n  flu -like symptoms, such as  headaches , fever\u00a0and muscle pain \n tiredness \n nausea \n diarrhoea \n \n You may be given additional medication to prevent or reduce side effects. Any side effects should improve over time as your body gets used to the medication. \n Follow-up \n After your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning. \n These appointments start off being every few weeks or months, but will become gradually less frequent over time. \n Want to know more? \n For more information, see: \n \n  Cancer Research UK:\u00a0treating Hodgkin lymphoma  \n  Cancer Research UK:\u00a0living with Hodgkin lymphoma  \n  Macmillan: treating Hodgkin lymphoma \u00a0 \n  Macmillan: living with Hodgkin lymphoma", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you see your GP because you're concerned about symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma, they'll ask about your health and carry out a simple physical examination. \n If necessary, your GP\u00a0will refer you to hospital for further tests. \n In 2015, the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma and refer people for the right tests faster. \n To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected Hodgkin lymphoma, read the  NICE 2015 guidelines on Suspected cancer: recognition and referral . \n If you're referred to hospital, a biopsy will usually be carried out, as this is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. \n Biopsy \n A\u00a0 biopsy  involves removing some or all of an affected lymph node, which is then studied in a laboratory. \n Biopsies are small operations that can often be carried out under a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  (where the area is numbed).

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hodgkin lymphoma: Children", "introduction": "Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of  blood cancer . It can affect children at any age but is more common in older teenagers and young adults. Each year in the UK, there are around 70 children aged 0-14 years, 120 young people aged 15-19 years, and 180 young people aged 20-24 years, diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming, but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and, if you have any questions, it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n What is Hodgkin lymphoma? \n Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymphatic system. There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which affects 95% of patients, and Lymphocyte Predominent Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL), which only affects 5% of patients. This information is about classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but it includes a short section about LPHL. \n The lymphatic system \n The lymphatic system is part of the immune system, the body\u2019s natural defence against infection and disease. \n The lymphatic system is made up of the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes (or lymph glands). Lymph nodes are connected by a network of tiny lymphatic vessels that contain lymph fluid. Lymphomas can start anywhere in the lymphatic system, but Hodgkin Lymphoma is most likely to start in the lymph nodes in the neck. The other areas where lymph nodes are likely to swell are above the collar bone, the armpit, the groin and inside the chest. Glands can swell in these areas as part of the body\u2019s response to infection, not just cancer, which is why a biopsy is needed to diagnose lymphoma. \n The number of lymph nodes varies from one part of the body to another. In some parts of the body, there are very few lymph nodes, whereas under your arm there may be 20-50. \n There are two main types of lymphoma:\u00a0 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)  and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Although these are both types of lymphoma, there are differences between them, which means they need different treatment. \n Causes \n The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known. In most people that develop Hodgkin lymphoma, no cause is found. However, there is increasing evidence that infections, such as the virus that causes glandular fever, may play a part in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma, especially in childhood. Poor immunity may also be a risk factor for developing the disease. Very rarely, more than one member of a family may develop Hodgkin lymphoma but it is not inherited from parents and you cannot catch it from another person. \n Signs and symptoms \n The first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of one gland, or a group of lymph glands, which continues for some weeks or even months. The first glands that are likely to be affected are in the neck or above the collarbone, most often only on one side. However, it\u2019s important to remember that children\u2019s glands can also become swollen when they have a common infection that causes a sore throat or a cold. If glands in the chest are affected, this can cause a cough or breathlessness. This is caused by the pressure the glands exert on the airways. \n Sometimes, a child with Hodgkin lymphoma may have a high temperature (fever), night sweats, weight loss or itchy skin. \n How Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed \n As lymph glands can swell for lots of reasons, a biopsy is carried out to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. A biopsy is when a swollen lymph gland is removed and the cells are looked at under a microscope. It\u2019s a small operation which is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Sometimes only a small part of the lymph gland has to be removed, which can be done under a local anaesthetic. \n If Hodgkin lymphoma is diagnosed after the biopsy, further tests are carried out to find out the exact size and position of the lymphoma, and to see whether it has spread beyond the original area. These tests include x-rays, blood tests, CT, MRI and PET scans. \n Very often, a bone marrow sample will be taken. This is because the lymphoma cells can spread to the bone marrow as well as to other lymph glands. \n The tests that are carried out are called staging tests. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) has more information about what the tests and scans involve. \n Staging \n The stage of Hodgkin lymphoma describes the size and position of the cancer and whether it has spread. Staging is very important because the type of treatment your child receives will depend on the stage of the disease. The staging system for Hodgkin lymphoma is as follows: \n  Stage 1  \n Only one group of lymph nodes is affected and the lymphoma is only on one side of the diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under the lungs that controls breathing). \n  Stage 2  \n Two or more groups of lymph nodes are affected, but they are only on one side of the diaphragm. \n  Stage 3  \n The lymphoma is in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm. \n  Stage 4  \n The lymphoma has spread outside the lymph nodes to other organs such as the liver, lungs or bone marrow. \n As well as giving each stage a number, doctors also use a letter code - either A, B, or E: \n \n A means your child has no symptoms. \n B means your child has one or more of the following symptoms: a fever, night sweats or significant weight loss. \n E means that the lymphoma has grown from the lymph gland to extranodal tissue (tissue in places outside the lymph nodes). \n \n A number and letter is used in the staging of every child with Hodgkin lymphoma. This helps the doctor decide on a treatment plan for your child. \n Treatment \n Children with Hodgkin lymphoma are usually treated with chemotherapy, but sometimes radiotherapy is also needed. The type and amount of treatment given depends on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed. Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you. \n Chemotherapy \n This is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. \n It is usual for a combination of drugs to be used, which will often be given every few weeks over a number of months. A combination of drugs is used because each chemotherapy drug works in a different way. Using several drugs together increases the effectiveness of the treatment. It also means lower doses of individual drugs can be used, which may reduce the possibility of long-term side effects. \n Radiotherapy \n This is used in less than half of people with Hodgkin lymphoma. It treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. \n Side effects of treatment \n Treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the particular treatment being used and the part of the body that is being treated. \n Some general side effects of chemotherapy that can occur during treatment include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n hair loss \n low blood count which can lead to an increased risk of infection, bruising and bleeding \n tiredness \n \n Changes to your child\u2019s sense of taste and changes in their bowel may also happen. If your child has side effects from the treatment it is important to discuss them with your doctor or nurse. They may be able to help reduce them. \n Late side effects of treatment \n The cure rate for Hodgkin lymphoma is very high, which means some children may develop side effects many years after treatment. The chance of developing late side effects depends on where the original tumour was, how far it spread, and the type of treatment your child had. \n These late side effects can affect the normal organs such as the heart, kidneys and lungs. Following treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, there is a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life. There is also a chance that fertility may be affected. Teenage boys who are diagnosed after puberty should have the option of sperm banking before treatment starts. In this situation, sperm can be stored for possible use in later years. \n Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will explain more about any possible late side effects. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. \n The aim of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma is to cure the cancer with the fewest possible short and long-term side effects. This is particularly important in childhood Hodgkin lymphoma where cure rates are high. It is important to get the balance right between curing the cancer and having the lowest risk of long-term side effects. \n If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you may have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide whether it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n About 90% of children who develop Hodgkin lymphoma are cured. When your child completes treatment, they will then go in to a follow-up phase, seeing doctors and nurses in out-patient clinics usually for around five years. Clinic visits will be every 3-4 months to start with and there will be occasional scans, x-rays, and blood tests done for several years after completing treatment. \n If the cancer comes back, a different course of treatment can be given. If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation. \n Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL) \n This is a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma that affects around 5% of patients. LPHL usually grows at a slower rate than classical Hodgkin lymphoma and normally requires less intensive treatment. Young people with LPHL may have a single swollen gland or group of swollen glands in one area only, such as the neck or groin. The swollen gland often grows very slowly and may be present for many months before a biopsy and diagnosis happens. The biopsy and staging tests will be carried out as with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment given will depend on the stage of the disease, but most patients are diagnosed with an early stage of the disease. \n LPHL is usually treated with surgery or low-dose chemotherapy. It may return many years after treatment, and further treatment may be required, but it is rarely a life-threatening condition. In rare cases, patients have advanced LPHL and receive more intensive chemotherapy. There is also a link between LPHL and developing a more aggressive  non-Hodgkin lymphoma . \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer.

It's mainly made by the liver, but can also be found in some foods. \n Having an excessively high level of lipids in your blood (hyperlipidemia) can have an effect on your health. \n High cholesterol itself doesn't usually cause any symptoms, but it increases your risk of serious health conditions. \n About cholesterol \n Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. \n The two main types of lipoprotein are:\u00a0 \n \n high-density lipoprotein (HDL) \u2013\u00a0carries cholesterol away from the cells and back to the liver, where it's either broken down or passed out of the body as a waste product; for this reason, HDL is referred to as \"good cholesterol\", and higher levels are better \n low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \u2013 carries cholesterol to the cells that need it, but if there's too much cholesterol for the cells to use, it can build up in the artery walls, leading to disease of the arteries; for this reason, LDL is known as \"bad cholesterol\" \n \n The amount of cholesterol in the blood\u00a0\u2013 both HDL and LDL\u00a0\u2013\u00a0can be measured with a  blood test . \n The recommended cholesterol levels in the blood vary between those with a higher or lower risk of developing arterial disease. \n Why should I lower my cholesterol? \n Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of: \n \n narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis)\u00a0 \n  heart attack \u00a0 \n  stroke \u00a0 \n  transient ischaemic attack (TIA) \u00a0\u2013 often known as a\u00a0\"mini stroke\" \n peripheral arterial disease (PAD) \n \n This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a\u00a0 blood clot  developing somewhere in your body. \n Your risk of\u00a0developing  coronary heart disease \u00a0also rises as your blood's cholesterol level increases. This can cause\u00a0pain in your chest or arm during stress or physical activity\u00a0( angina ). \n What causes high cholesterol? \n Many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol. \n These include: \n \n an unhealthy diet \u2013 in particular, eating high levels of saturated fat \n  smoking \u00a0\u2013 a chemical found in cigarettes called acrolein stops HDL transporting cholesterol from fatty deposits to the liver, leading to narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) \n having  diabetes  or  high blood pressure (hypertension)  \n having a family history of stroke or heart disease \n \n There's also an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia, which can cause high cholesterol even in someone who eats healthily. \n Read more about the  causes of high cholesterol  \n When should my cholesterol levels be tested? \n Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: \n \n have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) \n have a family history of early\u00a0 cardiovascular disease  \n have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition \n are overweight \n have high blood pressure, diabetes, or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels \n \n Read more about  how cholesterol is tested  \n What should my cholesterol levels be? \n Blood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/L. \n As a general guide, total cholesterol levels should be: \n \n 5mmol/L or less for healthy adults \n 4mmol/L or less for those at high risk \n \n As a general guide, LDL levels should be: \n \n 3mmol/L or less for healthy adults \n 2mmol/L or less for those at high risk \n \n An ideal level of HDL is above 1mmol/L. A lower level of HDL can increase your risk of heart disease. \n Your ratio of total cholesterol to HDL may also be calculated. This is your total cholesterol level divided by your HDL level. Generally, this ratio should be below four, as a higher ratio increases your risk of heart disease. \n However, cholesterol is only one risk factor and the level at which specific treatment is required will depend on whether other risk factors, such as smoking and high blood pressure, are also present. \n How can I lower my cholesterol level? \n The first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a  healthy, balanced diet . It's important to keep your diet low in fatty food. \n You can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help\u00a0 prevent high cholesterol  returning. \n Other lifestyle changes, such as\u00a0 taking regular exercise  and\u00a0 giving up smoking  (if you smoke), can also make a big difference in helping to lower your cholesterol. \n If these measures don't reduce your cholesterol and you continue to have a high risk of developing heart disease, your GP may prescribe a cholesterol-lowering medication, such as  statins . \n Your GP will take into account the risk of any side effects from statins, and the benefit of lowering your cholesterol must outweigh any risks. \n Read more about  how high cholesterol is treated", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "If you've been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you'll be advised to make changes to your diet and increase your level of exercise. \n After a few months, if your cholesterol level hasn't dropped, you may be advised to take cholesterol-lowering medication. \n Changing your diet,\u00a0 stopping smoking  and exercising more\u00a0will also help to prevent high cholesterol developing. \n The various treatments for high cholesterol are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Diet \n Eating a\u00a0 healthy, balanced diet  that's low in\u00a0saturated fats can reduce your level of \"bad cholesterol\" (LDL). \n Try to avoid or cut down on the following foods, which are high in saturated fat: \n \n fatty cuts of meat and meat products, such as sausages and pies \n butter, ghee and lard \n cream, soured cream,\u00a0cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and ice cream \n cheese, particularly hard cheese \n cakes and biscuits \n milk chocolate \n coconut oil, coconut cream and palm oil \n \n The government recommends that a maximum of 11% of a person's food energy should come from saturated fat. This equates to no more than: \n \n 30g of saturated fat a day for the average man \n 20g\u00a0of saturated fat a day\u00a0for the average\u00a0woman \n \n Children should have less. \n Check the labels on the foods you're eating to find out how much saturated fat you're consuming. \n Omega-3 fatty acids \n Many experts believe that the fats found in avocados and\u00a0oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon and tuna, are good for you. \n These are known as omega-3 fatty acids and high doses can improve (lower) triglyceride levels in some people. However, too much omega-3 fatty acids can contribute to  obesity . \n For people with a high triglyceride level, at least two portions of oily fish a week is thought to be beneficial. However, there's no evidence that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements has the same benefit. \n Cholesterol-lowering medication \n There are several different types of cholesterol-lowering medication that work in different ways. Your GP can advise you about the most suitable type of treatment, and may also prescribe  medication to lower high blood pressure (hypertension)  if it affects you. \n The most commonly prescribed medications are outlined below. \n Statins \n  Statins  block the enzyme (a type of chemical) in your liver that helps to make cholesterol. This leads to a reduction in your blood cholesterol level. \n You'll usually be started on a medication called atorvastatin. Other statins include simvastatin and rosuvastatin. \n When someone has side effects from using a statin, it's described as having an \"intolerance\" to it.  Side effects of statins  include  headaches , muscle pain and stomach problems, such as  indigestion ,\u00a0diarrhoea or  constipation . \n Statins will only be prescribed to people who continue to be at high risk of heart disease, because they need to be taken for life.\u00a0Cholesterol levels start to rise again once you stop taking them. \n Aspirin \n In some cases, a low daily dose of\u00a0 aspirin  may be prescribed, depending on your age (usually over 40 years old) and other risk factors. \n Low-dose aspirin can help to prevent\u00a0 blood clots  forming, particularly for someone who's had a\u00a0 heart attack , has established vascular disease, or a high risk of developing  cardiovascular disease (CVD) . \n You may also be advised to have periodic  blood tests  to ensure your liver is functioning well. \n Ezetimibe \n Ezetimibe is a medication that blocks the absorption of cholesterol from food and bile juices in your intestines into your blood. It's generally not as effective as statins, but is less likely to cause side effects. \n You can take ezetimibe at the same time as your usual statin if your cholesterol levels aren't low enough with the statin alone. The side effects of this combination are generally the same as those of the statin on its own (muscle pain and stomach problems). \n You can take ezetimibe by itself if you're unable to take a statin. This may be because you have another medical condition, you take medication that interferes with how the statin works, or because you experience side effects from statins. Ezetimibe taken on its own rarely causes side effects. \n For more information, you can read the National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines about the use of  ezetimibe for treating high cholesterol .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Blood cholesterol levels are measured with a simple blood test. \n Getting a cholesterol test \n A blood sample is taken that will be used to determine the amount of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL), good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL) and\u00a0other fatty substances (triglycerides) in your blood. \n You may be asked not to eat for 10-12 hours before the cholesterol test, usually including when you're asleep at night. This ensures that all food is completely digested and won't affect the outcome of the test. \n Your GP or practice nurse can carry out the\u00a0cholesterol test and will take a blood sample, either using a needle and a syringe or by pricking your finger. \n A newer type of test that measures non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) is now sometimes used because it's thought to be a more accurate way of estimating\u00a0 cardiovascular disease (CVD)  risk than LDL. \n Non-HDL cholesterol is total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol. It's also not necessary to fast before the test, so it\u00a0is more convenient. \n Who should be tested? \n Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you: \n \n have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease,  stroke  or  mini-stroke (TIA) , or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) \n are over the age of 40\u00a0\u2013\u00a0people over 40 should have their estimate of CVD risk reviewed regularly \n have a family history of early cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u2013 for example, if your father or brother developed heart disease or had a  heart attack  or stroke before the age of 55, or if your mother or sister had these conditions before the age of 65 \n have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition, such as familial hypercholesterolaemia \n are overweight or obese \n have high blood pressure or diabetes \n have another medical condition, such as  kidney disease , an  underactive thyroid , or an  inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) \u00a0\u2013 these conditions can cause increased levels of cholesterol or triglycerides \n \n Results \n After your cholesterol test, your GP or nurse will explain your results and calculate whether you have a high, moderate or low risk of developing heart disease or stroke (cardiovascular disease)\u00a0within the next 10 years. \n However, this risk isn't just based on your cholesterol reading. It also takes into account: \n \n your\u00a0BMI (body mass index)\u00a0\u2013 which measures your weight in relation to your height \n treatable risk factors\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as  high blood pressure (hypertension) ,  diabetes \u00a0and other medical conditions \n your age, sex, family history and ethnicity \n \n Based on your results, your GP or nurse will recommend steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing CVD. \n This may include advice about making lifestyle changes, such as eating more healthily\u00a0\u2013\u00a0by increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, for example\u00a0\u2013 and doing more exercise. \n Cholesterol-lowering medication, such as  statins , may also be recommended. \n Read more about  treating high cholesterol  \n Familial hypercholesterolaemia \n People with familial hypercholesterolaemia, or inherited high cholesterol, are at increased risk of developing CVD. \n In the UK, most of the 120,000 people thought to have the condition are undiagnosed and untreated. \n As a result of the increased risk of developing CVD, it's very important that those with familial hypercholesterolaemia are diagnosed as early as possible and offered appropriate treatment. \n The\u00a0 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  recommends that adults with a total cholesterol level of above 7.5mmol/l before treatment should be assessed for\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia. \n If you've been diagnosed with\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia, you'll be referred for a specialist assessment, which may include DNA testing to confirm the diagnosis. \n Appropriate treatment will be recommended and other members of your family who may be affected will also be tested. \n You'll be closely monitored, and should have a full review at least once a year to check how well your treatment is working and assess any symptoms you may have. \n Children \n Children at risk of\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia will be tested by the time they reach\u00a010 years of age. \n This is because any signs of CVD, such as thickening of the carotid artery wall, will be identifiable by this age. \n The assessment will be carried out by a specialist with expertise in familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and young people. \n Early diagnosis of\u00a0familial hypercholesterolaemia means it's possible to recommend lifestyle changes and other appropriate treatments to reduce the long-term problems associated with high cholesterol and improve long-term health. \n For further information, see the\u00a0 NICE guidance about familial hypercholesterolaemia"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hiatus hernia", "introduction": "A hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (\"hiatus\") in the diaphragm. \n The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle\u00a0between the chest\u00a0and the abdomen (tummy). \n Hiatus hernia and heartburn \n A hiatus hernia itself rarely\u00a0has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called\u00a0 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) . \n GORD is where stomach acid leaks into the oesophagus (the tube that carries food to the stomach). It can occur if a hiatus hernia prevents the valve at the bottom of the oesophagus from working properly. \n Your oesophagus can become\u00a0severely irritated, because it's not protected against stomach acid. This can cause symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, an unpleasant sour\u00a0taste in your mouth, and swallowing problems ( dysphagia ). \n You should see your GP if you have frequent and severe  symptoms of GORD . \n What causes a hiatus hernia? \n It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen. \n Hiatus hernia can sometimes occur in newborn babies if the stomach or diaphragm doesn't develop properly. \n Who's affected \n Hiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are: \n \n over 50 years of age \n overweight \n pregnant \n \n It's estimated that a third of people over 50 have a hiatus hernia. \n There's also a\u00a0rare type of hiatus hernia that affects newborn babies, which\u00a0is caused by a congenital defect of the stomach or diaphragm. Congenital means that it is present from birth. \n Types of hiatus hernia \n There are 2\u00a0main types of hiatus hernia. They are: \n \n sliding hiatus hernias \u2013 hernias that\u00a0move up and down, in and out of the chest area (more than 80% of hiatus hernias are of this type) \n para-oesophageal hiatus hernias \u2013 also called rolling hiatus hernias, where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus (about 5-15% of hiatus hernias are of this type) \n \n These pages\u00a0mainly focus on sliding hiatus hernias. They can usually be diagnosed using an\u00a0 X-ray  or an endoscopy, where a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end is used to examine the inside of the body. \n Read more about  diagnosing a hiatus hernia . \n Treating a hiatus hernia \n Treatment for a sliding hiatus hernia\u00a0usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn. \n Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven't worked. \n Lifestyle advice\u00a0may include: \n \n eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than 3\u00a0large meals a day \n avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for 3\u00a0hours after eating or drinking \n removing any foods or drinks\u00a0from your diet\u00a0that make your symptoms worse \u00a0 \n \n If a hiatus hernia isn't causing any noticeable problems, it doesn't usually need to be treated. \n Surgery is used to repair a para-oesophageal hiatus hernia if there's a\u00a0risk of serious complications. \n Read more about  treating a hiatus hernia . \n Further problems \n It's rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications,\u00a0but long-term damage\u00a0to the oesophagus\u00a0caused by\u00a0leaking stomach acid can lead to\u00a0ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus,\u00a0which can increase your risk of  oesophageal cancer . \n Read more about the  complications of a hiatus hernia .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Treatment for a hiatus hernia is usually only necessary if it's causing problems. \n In most cases, people with a hiatus hernia only experience problems if the hernia causes\u00a0 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) . GORD can cause symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in your mouth. \n Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments, although surgery may be used as an alternative to long-term medication, or if other treatments are ineffective. \n Lifestyle changes \n There are several things you can do yourself to help relieve\u00a0 symptoms of GORD  caused by a hiatus hernia. These include: \n \n eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than three large meals a day \n avoiding lying down (including going to bed) for at least 3\u00a0hours after\u00a0eating or drinking \n avoiding drinking during the night \n removing certain\u00a0foods\u00a0from your diet if you think they make your symptoms worse \n avoiding  alcohol , caffeine, chocolate, tomatoes, fatty foods, spicy foods and acidic food\u00a0or drinks, such as citrus fruit juice, if they make your symptoms worse \n avoiding bending over or stooping, particularly after eating or drinking \n raising the head of your bed by around 20cm (8 inches) by placing a piece of wood or blocks under it; don't use extra pillows, because this may increase pressure on your abdomen \n \n If you're overweight,\u00a0 losing weight  may help to reduce the severity and frequency of your symptoms. \n If you smoke, you should try to give up. Tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system and may make your symptoms worse. \n Read about\u00a0 stopping smoking . \n Medication \n A number of different medications can be used to treat symptoms of hiatus hernia. These are described below. \n Antacids \n Antacid medicines\u00a0can relieve some of the symptoms of hiatus hernia.\u00a0They come in liquid or tablet form and\u00a0can be swallowed or chewed. They help to neutralise\u00a0stomach acid when they reach the oesophagus and stomach by making it less acidic. \n However, antacid medicines don't work for everyone. They're not a long-term solution if symptoms persist or you're in extreme discomfort. \n Antacids shouldn't be taken at the same time as other medicines, because they can stop other medicines from being properly absorbed\u00a0by your body. They may also damage the special coating on some types of tablets. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice. \n Alginates \n Alginates are an alternative medicine to antacids. They work by producing a protective coating that shields the lining of your stomach and oesophagus from the effects of stomach acid. \n H2-receptor antagonists \n In some cases,\u00a0a medicine known as an H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) may be recommended if a hiatus hernia is causing GORD. Examples of H2RAs include cimetidine,\u00a0famotidine (PepcidTwo) and ranitidine. \n H2RAs block the effects of the chemical histamine, which\u00a0your body\u00a0uses to produce stomach acid. H2RAs therefore help to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. \n Side effects of H2RAs are uncommon. However, possible side effects may include  diarrhoea ,  headaches , tiredness\u00a0and a\u00a0rash. \n Some H2RAs are available over the counter at pharmacies. These types of HR2As are taken in a lower dosage than the ones available on prescription. Ask your GP or pharmacist if you're not sure\u00a0whether these medicines are suitable for you. \n Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) \n Your GP may prescribe a medication called a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced by your stomach. Examples of the\u00a0PPIs you may be prescribed include omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole. \n Most people tolerate PPIs well and side effects are uncommon. When they do occur, they're usually mild and can include headaches, diarrhoea, feeling sick or  constipation . \n To minimise any side effects, your GP will prescribe the lowest possible dose of PPIs they think will be effective. You should let your GP know if the prescribed dose of PPIs doesn't work. A stronger dose may be needed.\u00a0 \n Surgery \n Surgery is usually only recommended for a sliding hiatus hernia (hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area)\u00a0if the problem fails to respond to lifestyle changes and medication. \n You may also want to consider surgery if you have persistent and troublesome symptoms, but don't want to take medication on a long-term basis. \n Prior to surgery, you may need further investigations to check how well the oesophagus moves (manometry) and\u00a0how much acid is being refluxed (24-hour oesopageal pH studies). \n Laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF) \n A procedure called a laparoscopic nissen fundoplication (LNF) is one of the most common surgical techniques used to treat GORD and sliding hiatus hernias. \n LNF is a type of keyhole surgery that involves making a series of small cuts in your abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate your abdomen to give the surgeon room to work in. \n During LNF,\u00a0the stomach is put back into the correct position and the diaphragm around the lower part of the oesophagus is tightened. This should prevent any acid moving back out of your stomach. \n LNF is carried out under  general anaesthetic ,\u00a0so you won't feel any pain or discomfort. The surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes to complete. \n After having LNF, you should be able to leave hospital after you've recovered from the effects of the general anaesthetic. This is usually within 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days. Depending on the type of job you do, you should be able to return to work within 3\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks. \n For the first 6\u00a0weeks after surgery, it's recommended that you only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Avoid eating hard food that could get stuck at the site of the surgery, such as toast, chicken or steak. \n Common side effects of LNF include difficulties swallowing ( dysphagia ), belching, bloating and  flatulence . \n These side effects should resolve over the course of a few months. However, in about 1 in 100 cases they can be persistent. In such circumstances, further corrective surgery may be required. \n Para-oesophageal hiatus hernia \n If you have a\u00a0para-oesophageal hiatus hernia, where the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus, surgery may be recommended to reduce the risk of the hernia becoming strangulated (see  complications of a hiatus hernia  for more information).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "A hiatus hernia can usually be diagnosed after a gastroscopy or X-ray. \n Gastroscopy \n A\u00a0gastroscopy\u00a0is a procedure where the\u00a0inside of your body is examined using a gastroscope\u00a0(a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end), which sends images to an external monitor. \n The gastroscope will be inserted into your mouth and down your throat, and will be used to help identify any problems. The procedure may be carried out using a  local anaesthetic  or a sedative to help you relax. \n Barium meal X-ray \n The barium meal\u00a0 X-ray , also called the barium swallow test, is an effective way of\u00a0identifying a hiatus hernia. \n As part of the test, you'll be asked to drink some barium solution. Barium is a non-toxic chemical\u00a0that shows up clearly on an\u00a0X-ray. Once the barium moves down into your digestive system, a series of X-rays will be taken to identify any problems. \n If you need to have a barium meal X-ray, you won't be able to eat or drink anything for at least 6\u00a0hours before the procedure, so that your stomach and duodenum (the top of the small intestine) are empty. You may be given an injection to relax the muscles in your digestive system. \n You'll be given a white, chalky liquid containing barium to drink while lying down. This will allow the specialist to see your stomach on an X-ray monitor more easily, as well as any ulcers or abnormal growths. Your\u00a0bed may be tipped slightly during the test, so that the barium fills all the areas of your stomach. \n A barium swallow usually takes about 15 minutes to perform. Afterwards, you'll be able to eat and drink as normal, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your system. \n You may feel slightly sick after a barium meal X-ray and the barium may cause  constipation . Your stools may also be white for a few days afterwards, as the barium passes through your system."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hepatitis C", "introduction": "Hepatitis C is a virus that can infect the liver. If left untreated, it can sometimes cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage to the liver over many years. \n However, with modern treatments it's often possible to cure the infection and most people with it will have a normal life expectancy. \n It's estimated that around 215,000 people in\u00a0the UK\u00a0have hepatitis C. \n You can become infected with\u00a0it if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person. \n Symptoms of hepatitis C \n Hepatitis C often doesn't have any noticeable symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without realising it. \n When symptoms do occur, they can be mistaken for another condition. Symptoms can include: \n \n  flu-like symptoms , such as\u00a0muscle aches\u00a0and a high temperature (fever) \n feeling tired all the time \n loss of appetite \n  abdominal (tummy) pain  \n feeling and being sick \n \n The only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested (see below). \n Read more about the  symptoms of hepatitis C . \n How do you get hepatitis C? \n The hepatitis C virus is usually\u00a0spread through blood-to-blood contact. \n Some ways the infection can be spread include: \n \n sharing unsterilised needles\u00a0\u2013 particularly needles used to inject recreational drugs\u00a0 \n sharing razors or toothbrushes \n from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby \n through unprotected sex\u00a0\u2013 although this is very rare \n \n In the UK, most hepatitis C infections occur in people who inject drugs or have injected them in the past. It's estimated that around half of those who inject drugs have the infection. \n Read more about the  causes of hepatitis C . \n Getting tested for hepatitis C \n Seek medical advice if you have persistent symptoms of hepatitis C, or there's a risk you're infected, even if you don't have any symptoms. A  blood test  can be carried out to see if you have the infection.\u00a0 \n Your GP, sexual health clinic, GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinic or drug treatment service all offer testing for hepatitis C. \n Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or limit any damage to your liver and help ensure the infection isn't passed on to other people. \n Read more about  testing for hepatitis C . \n Treatments for\u00a0hepatitis C \n Hepatitis C can be treated with a combination of medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. These usually need to be taken for several months. \n Most people will take 2\u00a0main medications called pegylated interferon (a weekly injection) and ribavirin (a capsule or tablet), although newer tablet-only treatments are likely to replace the interferon injections for most people in the near future. \n These newer hepatitis C medications have been found to make treatment more effective. They include simeprevir, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. \n Using the latest medications, up to 90% or more of people with hepatitis C may be cured. However, it's important to be aware that you won't be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again (see below). \n Read more about  treating hepatitis C \u00a0and  living with hepatitis C . \n Complications of hepatitis C \n If the infection is left untreated for many years, some people with hepatitis C will develop scarring of the\u00a0liver ( cirrhosis ).\u00a0Over time, this can cause the liver to stop working properly. \n In severe cases, life-threatening problems such as liver failure (where the liver loses most or all of its functions) or\u00a0 liver cancer  can eventually develop. \n Treating hepatitis C as early as possible can help reduce the risk of these problems occurring. \n Read more about the  complications of hepatitis C . \n Preventing hepatitis C \n There's no vaccine for hepatitis C, but\u00a0there are ways to reduce your risk of becoming infected, such as: \n \n not sharing\u00a0any drug-injecting equipment with other people\u00a0\u2013 including\u00a0needles and other equipment such as\u00a0syringes, spoons and filters \n not sharing razors or\u00a0toothbrushes that might be contaminated with blood \n \n The risk of getting hepatitis C through sex is very low. However, it may be higher\u00a0if\u00a0blood is present, such as menstrual blood or from minor bleeding during anal sex. \n Condoms aren't usually necessary to prevent hepatitis C for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner.", "symptoms": "Many people with hepatitis C don't have any symptoms and are unaware they have the infection. They may develop symptoms later on as their liver becomes increasingly damaged. \n Early symptoms \n Only around 1\u00a0in\u00a0every 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0people will have any symptoms during the first 6\u00a0months of a hepatitis C infection. This stage is known as acute hepatitis C. \n If symptoms do develop, they usually occur\u00a0a few weeks after\u00a0infection. Symptoms may include: \n \n a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above \n tiredness \n loss of appetite \n  abdominal (tummy)\u00a0pains  \n feeling and being sick \n \n Around 1\u00a0in every 5\u00a0people who experiences symptoms\u00a0will also have yellowing of the eyes and skin. This is known as jaundice. \n In around 1\u00a0in\u00a0every 4\u00a0people infected with hepatitis C, the immune system will kill the virus within a few months and\u00a0the person will have no further symptoms, unless they become infected again. \n In the remaining cases, the virus persists inside the body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis. \n Later symptoms \n The symptoms of long-term (chronic) hepatitis C can vary widely. In some people, symptoms may be barely noticeable. In others, they can have a significant impact on quality of life. \n The symptoms can also go away for long periods of time and then return. \n Some of the most common\u00a0problems experienced by people with chronic hepatitis C include: \n \n feeling tired all the time \n joint and muscle aches and pain \n feeling sick \n problems with short-term memory, concentration and completing complex mental tasks such as mental arithmetic \u2013 many people describe this as \"brain fog\" \n mood swings \n  depression \u00a0or anxiety \n  indigestion  or bloating \n  itchy skin \u00a0 \n abdominal pain \n \n If left untreated, the infection can eventually cause\u00a0the liver\u00a0to become scarred  (cirrhosis).  Signs of cirrhosis can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark stools and a build-up of fluid in the legs or abdomen. \n Read more about the  complications of hepatitis C . \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you persistently have any of the\u00a0later symptoms above, or if they keep returning. They may recommend having a blood test that can check for hepatitis C. Read more about  diagnosing hepatitis C . \n None of the symptoms above\u00a0mean you\u00a0definitely have hepatitis C, but it's important to get them checked out. \n You should also speak to your GP about getting tested if there's a risk you're infected, even if you don't have any symptoms. This particularly includes people who inject drugs or have done so in the past. \n Read about the\u00a0 causes of hepatitis C  for more information about who's at risk of having the infection.", "causes": "You can become infected with hepatitis C if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person. \n Other bodily fluids can also contain the virus, but blood contains the highest level of it.\u00a0Just a small trace of blood can cause an infection. At room temperature, it's thought the virus\u00a0may be able survive outside the body in patches of dried blood on surfaces for up to several weeks. \n The main ways you can become infected with the hepatitis C virus are described below. \n Injecting drugs \n People who inject drugs, including\u00a0illegal recreational drugs and performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids,\u00a0are at the highest risk of becoming infected with hepatitis C. \n Almost 90% of hepatitis C cases in the UK occur in people who inject drugs or have injected them in the past. It's estimated that around half of the people in the UK who inject drugs have\u00a0the infection. \n The infection can be spread by sharing needles and associated equipment. Injecting yourself with just one contaminated needle may be enough to become infected. \n It's also possible to get the infection by sharing other equipment used to prepare or take drugs\u00a0\u2013 such as spoons, filters, pipes and straws\u00a0\u2013 that have been contaminated with infected blood. \n Less common causes \n Unprotected sex \n Hepatitis C may be transmitted during unprotected sex (sex without using a condom), although this risk is considered very low. \n The risk of transmission through sex may be higher\u00a0among men who have sex with men. The risk is also increased if\u00a0there are\u00a0genital sores or ulcers from a  sexually transmitted infection , or if either person also has  HIV . \n The best way to prevent transmission of hepatitis C through sex is to use a  male condom  or  female condom . However, as the risk is very low for\u00a0couples in a long-term relationship, many\u00a0choose not to use a condom. \n If your partner has hepatitis C, you should be tested for the condition. \n Blood donations before September 1991 \n Since September 1991, all blood donated in the UK is checked for the hepatitis C virus. If you\u00a0received\u00a0 blood transfusions  or blood products before this date, there's a small possibility\u00a0you\u00a0may have been infected with hepatitis C. \n Blood transfusions and treatment abroad\u00a0 \n If\u00a0you have a blood transfusion or medical or dental treatment overseas where medical equipment is not sterilised properly, you may become infected with hepatitis C. The virus can survive in traces of blood left on equipment. \n Sharing toothbrushes, scissors and razors \n There's a potential risk that hepatitis C may be passed on through sharing items such as toothbrushes, razors and scissors, as they can become contaminated with infected blood. \n Equipment used by hairdressers, such as scissors and clippers,\u00a0can pose a risk if it has been contaminated with infected blood and not been sterilised or cleaned between customers. However, most salons operate to high standards, so this risk is low. \n Tattooing and body piercing \n There is a risk that hepatitis C may be passed on through\u00a0using tattooing or body piercing equipment that has not been properly sterilised. However, most tattoo and body piercing parlours in the UK operate to high standards and are regulated by law, so this risk is low. \n Mother to child \n There is\u00a0a small\u00a0chance that a mother who is infected with the hepatitis C virus will pass the infection on to her baby. This happens in around 5% of cases. \n It's not thought that the virus can be passed on by a mother to her baby in her breast milk. \n Needlestick injury \n There's a small (approximately one in 30) risk of getting hepatitis C if your skin is accidentally punctured by a needle used by someone with hepatitis C. \n Healthcare workers, nurses and laboratory technicians are at increased risk because they are in regular close contact with blood and bodily fluids that may contain blood.", "treatment": "Hepatitis C can often be treated successfully by taking a combination of medicines for several months. \n If\u00a0the infection is diagnosed in\u00a0the early stages, known as acute hepatitis, treatment may not need to begin straight\u00a0away. Instead, you may have another blood test after a few months to see if your body fights off the virus. \n If the infection continues for several months, known as chronic hepatitis, treatment will usually be recommended. \n Your treatment plan \n Treatment for hepatitis C involves: \n \n making\u00a0lifestyle changes to help prevent further damage to your liver and reduce the risk of spreading the infection \n taking a combination of 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0medications to fight the virus\u00a0\u2013 this is known as combination therapy \n \n You'll normally need to take medication for 12 to 48 weeks. This length of time will depend on the exact medicines you're taking\u00a0and which version (strain) of the hepatitis C virus you have. Your doctor will advise you about this. \n There are 6\u00a0main strains of the virus. In the UK, the most common strains are known as \"genotype 1\" and \"genotype 3\". \n During treatment, you should have\u00a0 blood tests  to check\u00a0if\u00a0your medication is working. If the test shows treatment is\u00a0having little effect, it may be stopped as further treatment may be of little use. \n Lifestyle measures \n There are some\u00a0things you can do to help limit any damage to your liver and prevent the infection spreading to others. These can\u00a0include: \n \n eating a  healthy and balanced\u00a0diet  \n exercising regularly \n cutting out alcohol or limiting your intake \n  stopping smoking  \n keeping personal items, such as toothbrushes or razors, for your own use \n not sharing\u00a0any\u00a0needles or syringes with others \n \n Read\u00a0some  FAQs about living with hepatitis C \u00a0for more information. \n Hepatitis C medications \n Until relatively recently, treatment for chronic hepatitis C usually involved taking 2\u00a0main medicines: \n \n pegylated interferon \u2013 a medication that encourages the immune system to attack the virus \n ribavirin \u2013 an antiviral medication that stops the virus reproducing \n \n These medications were\u00a0frequently just taken together,\u00a0but\u00a0nowadays they're often combined with a third medication, such as simeprevir or sofosbuvir. These are newer hepatitis C medications that have been shown to make treatment more effective. \n In\u00a0some cases, a combination of these newer medications may be taken without needing to take pegylated interferon and/or ribavirin as well. Read more about all these medications below. \n Pegylated interferon and ribavirin \n Pegylated interferon is usually taken as a weekly injection. You can be trained to inject yourself at home. It usually needs to be taken for\u00a0up to\u00a048 weeks, depending on your circumstances. \n Ribavirin is available as capsules, tablets or an oral solution. It's normally taken twice a day with food. It needs to be taken alongside pegylated interferon for\u00a0up to\u00a048 weeks. \n For more information see the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on\u00a0 peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C . \n Newer medications \n There are also a number of newer medicines that are often used to treat hepatitis C nowadays. \n Some of these are taking alongside pegylated interferon and/or ribavirin, while some can be taken on their own or in combination with other new medicines. \n These medications include: \n \n simeprevir \n sofosbuvir \n daclatasvir \n a combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir \n a combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir, taken with or without dasabuvir \n \n These medications are taken as tablets once or twice a day, for between eight and 48 weeks, depending on the exact medicine you're taking, your hepatitis C genotype and the severity of your condition. \n These medicines are generally used to treat people with either genotype 1 or genotype 4 hepatitis C, although sometimes they're\u00a0also used to treat people with other genotypes. \n For more information, see the NICE guidelines on: \n \n  simeprevir for treating\u00a0chronic hepatitis C  \n  sofosbuvir for treating chronic hepatitis C  \n  daclatasvir for treating chronic hepatitis C  \n  ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for treating chronic hepatitis C  \n  ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir with or without dasabuvir for treating chronic hepatitis C  \n \n Research into even more effective medications is ongoing. \n How effective is treatment? \n The effectiveness of treatment for hepatitis C can depend on the strain of the virus you have. \n Genotype 1 used to be more challenging to treat and, until quite recently, less than half of people treated would be cured. \n However, with the newer medications now available, the chances of a cure can be much higher. Combinations of tablets can now have a cure rate of more than 90%. \n This is higher than the chances of curing most other hepatitis C genotypes. \n Treatment for genotype 3 will usually involve the standard treatments of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. About 70-80% of those treated will be cured. \n If the virus is successfully cleared with treatment, it's important to be aware that you're not immune to the infection. This means, for example, that you could become infected again if you continue to inject drugs after treatment. \n If treatment doesn't work, it may be repeated, extended or tried using a different combination of medicines. \n Side effects of treatment \n Side effects of combination therapy involving interferon are quite common. The new tablet treatments have far fewer side effects and most people feel unaffected by them. \n If your treatment involves interferon, side effects can include: \n \n  flu -like symptoms, such as a headache, fatigue (extreme tiredness) and a high temperature (fever) \n a reduced\u00a0number of red blood cells ( anaemia ), which can make you feel tired and out of breath \n a rash \n  depression  \n itchy skin \n feeling and being sick \n  constipation \u00a0or\u00a0 diarrhoea  \n problems sleeping ( insomnia ) \n loss of appetite and weight loss \n \n Hepatitis C medications can have unpredictable reactions when taken\u00a0with other medicines or remedies. Always check with your specialist, GP or pharmacist before taking other types of medication. \n Any side effects may improve with time as your body gets used to the medications. Tell your care team if any side effect is becoming particularly troublesome. \n Coping with side effects\u00a0can be challenging, but you should continue to take your medication as instructed. Missing doses\u00a0may reduce the chances of you being cured. \n Treatment during pregnancy \n The medications used to treat hepatitis C, particularly ribavirin, can be harmful to unborn babies and aren't normally\u00a0used during pregnancy. \n If you're pregnant when diagnosed with the infection, treatment will usually be delayed until you have given birth. Otherwise, you'll be advised to use contraception throughout your treatment and you may need to have regular pregnancy tests. \n If you're a man taking ribavirin, you\u00a0shouldn't have\u00a0sex with a pregnant women unless you use a condom. If your partner isn't pregnant, you should ensure contraception is used during\u00a0the course of your treatment and your partner may need to have regular pregnancy tests. \n Deciding against treatment \n Some people with chronic hepatitis C decide against treatment. This may be because they: \n \n don't have any symptoms \n are willing to live with the risk of\u00a0cirrhosis at a later date \n don't feel the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the side effects treatment can\u00a0cause \n \n Your care team can give you advice about this,\u00a0but the final decision about treatment will be yours. \n If you decide not to have treatment but then change your mind, you can ask to be treated at any point.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you think you may have been exposed to hepatitis C, taking a test will put your mind at rest or, if the test is positive, allow you to start treatment early. \n  GP surgeries ,  sexual health clinics , GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics\u00a0or\u00a0drug treatment services all offer testing for hepatitis C. \n Who should get tested? \n You should consider getting tested for hepatitis C if you're worried you could have been infected or you\u00a0fall into one of the groups at an increased risk of being infected. \n Hepatitis C often has no symptoms, so you may still be infected if you feel healthy. \n The following groups of people are at an increased risk of hepatitis C: \n \n ex-drug users and current drug users, particularly users of injected drugs \n people who received\u00a0 blood transfusions  before September 1991 \n recipients of organ or tissue transplants before 1992 \n people\u00a0who have lived or had medical treatment in an area where hepatitis C is common\u00a0\u2013 high risk areas include North Africa, the Middle East and Central and East Asia \n babies and children whose mothers have hepatitis C \n anyone accidentally exposed to the virus, such as health workers \n people who have received a tattoo or piercing where equipment may not have been properly sterilised \n sexual partners of people with hepatitis C \n \n If you continue to engage in high-risk activities, such as injecting drugs frequently, regular testing may be recommended. Your\u00a0doctor will be able to advise you about this. \n Testing for hepatitis C \n Hepatitis C is diagnosed\u00a0using 2\u00a0 blood tests : the antibody test and the PCR test.\u00a0The\u00a0results usually come back within 2\u00a0weeks. \n The antibody test \n The antibody\u00a0blood test determines whether you have ever been exposed to the hepatitis C virus by testing for the presence of antibodies to the virus. Antibodies are\u00a0produced by your immune system to fight\u00a0germs. \n The\u00a0test will not show a positive reaction for some months after infection because your body takes time to make these antibodies. \n If the test is negative, but you have\u00a0symptoms or\u00a0you may have been exposed to hepatitis C, you may be advised to have the test again. \n A positive test indicates\u00a0that you have been infected at some stage. It doesn't necessarily mean you are currently infected, as\u00a0you may have since cleared the virus from your body. \n The only way to tell if you are currently infected is to have a second blood test, called a PCR test. \n The PCR test \n The PCR\u00a0blood test\u00a0checks if the virus is still present by detecting whether it is reproducing inside your body. \n A positive test\u00a0means that\u00a0your body has not fought off the virus, and the infection has progressed to a chronic (long-term) stage. \n Further tests \n If you have an active hepatitis C infection, you will be referred to a specialist for further tests\u00a0to check if your liver has been damaged. \n The tests you may have include: \n \n blood tests \u2013 these\u00a0measure certain enzymes and proteins in your bloodstream that indicate whether your liver is damaged or inflamed \n  ultrasound scans \u00a0\u2013 where sound waves are used to test how stiff\u00a0your liver is (stiffness suggests the liver is scarred) \n \n The specialist can also talk to you about any treatment you may need.

\n People at highest risk of hepatitis B include: \n \n people born or brought up in a\u00a0country where the infection is common \n babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B \n people who have ever injected drugs \n anyone who has had unprotected sex, including anal or oral sex \u2013 particularly people who've had multiple sexual partners, people who've had sex with someone in or from a high-risk area, men who have sex with men, and commercial sex workers \n close contacts, such as family members, of someone with long-term (chronic) hepatitis B infection \n \n The risk\u00a0of getting hepatitis B for travellers going\u00a0to places where the infection is common is generally considered to be low if the activities mentioned above are avoided. \n Your GP can arrange for you to have a blood\u00a0test to check for hepatitis B and have the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccination\u00a0if you're at a high risk. \n  High-risk \u00a0areas \n Hepatitis B is\u00a0found\u00a0throughout the world, but is\u00a0particularly common in: \n \n sub-Saharan Africa \n east and southeast Asia \n the Pacific Islands \n parts of South America \n southern parts of eastern and central Europe \n the Middle East \n the Indian subcontinent \n \n Most new cases of hepatitis B in the UK occur in people who caught the infection in one of these areas before moving to the UK.", "treatment": "Treatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you've been infected for: \n \n short-term (acute) hepatitis B\u00a0doesn't usually need specific treatment, but may require treatment to relieve the symptoms \n long-term (chronic) hepatitis B\u00a0is\u00a0often treated with medication to keep the virus under control \n \n Emergency treatment\u00a0can also be given soon after possible exposure to the hepatitis B virus to stop an infection developing. \n  Emergency \u00a0hepatitis B treatment \n See your GP as soon as possible if you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus. \n To help stop you becoming infected, they can give you: \n \n a dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine \u2013 you'll also need 2\u00a0further doses over the next few months to give you long-term protection \n hepatitis B immunoglobulin \u00a0 \u2013 a preparation of antibodies that work against the hepatitis B virus and can offer immediate but short-term protection until the vaccine starts to take effect \n \n These are most effective if given within 48 hours after possible exposure to hepatitis B,\u00a0but you can still have them up to a week after exposure. \n  Treatment\u00a0 for acute hepatitis B \n If you're diagnosed with hepatitis B, your GP will usually refer you to\u00a0a specialist, such as a hepatologist (liver specialist). \n Many people don't have any troublesome symptoms, but if you do feel unwell, it can help to: \n \n get plenty of rest \n take over-the-counter painkillers, such as\u00a0 paracetamol  or  ibuprofen , for  tummy (abdominal) pain  \n maintain a cool, well-ventilated environment, wear loose clothing, and avoid hot baths or showers if itching is a problem \n take medication\u00a0such as\u00a0metoclopramide to stop you feeling sick and chlorphenamine to reduce itching\u00a0\u2013 your doctor can give you\u00a0a prescription for these if necessary \n \n Most people recover completely in a couple of months, but you'll be advised to have regular  blood tests \u00a0to check\u00a0that you're free of the virus and haven't developed chronic hepatitis B. \n  Treatment \u00a0for chronic hepatitis B \n If blood tests show that you still have hepatitis B after 6\u00a0months, your doctor may recommend medication to reduce the risk of  complications of hepatitis B \u00a0and\u00a0regular tests to assess the\u00a0health of your liver. \n Treatment is usually offered if: \n \n your immune system is unable to control the hepatitis B\u00a0by\u00a0itself \n there's evidence of ongoing liver damage \n \n Hepatitis B\u00a0medications\u00a0can help keep the virus under control and stop it damaging\u00a0your liver, although\u00a0they won't\u00a0necessarily cure the infection and some people need lifelong treatment. \n The main medicines for chronic hepatitis B are outlined below. \n Peginterferon alfa-2a \n If your liver is working fairly well, the first treatment offered is usually a medicine called\u00a0peginterferon alfa 2-a. \n This stimulates the immune system to attack the hepatitis B virus and regain control over it. It's usually given by injection once a week for 48 weeks. \n Common side effects include\u00a0flu-like symptoms, such as a\u00a0fever and muscle and joint pain, after you start\u00a0to take the medicine, although these should improve with time. \n Tests will be carried out during treatment to see how well\u00a0it's working. Alternative medicines may be recommended if it's not helping. \n Antiviral medicines \n If\u00a0your liver isn't working well, or peginterferon alpha-2a is not suitable or not working for you, your doctor may recommend trying antiviral medication instead. \n This\u00a0will\u00a0usually\u00a0be either tenofovir\u00a0or entecavir, both of which\u00a0are taken as tablets. \n Common side effects of these medicines include feeling sick, vomiting and dizziness. \n Living with hepatitis B \n If you have hepatitis, you should: \n \n avoid having unprotected sex\u00a0\u2013 including anal and oral sex, unless you're sure your partner has\u00a0been vaccinated against hepatitis B \n avoid sharing needles used to inject drugs with other people \n take precautions to avoid the spread of infection\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0not sharing toothbrushes or razors with other people; close contacts such as family members may need to be vaccinated \n eat a generally healthy,\u00a0 balanced diet \u00a0\u2013 there's no special diet for people with hepatitis B \n avoid drinking alcohol\u00a0\u2013 this can increase your risk of developing serious liver problems \n speak to your doctor if you're thinking of having a baby \n \n People with hepatitis B can usually have a healthy pregnancy, but it's a good idea to discuss your plans with a doctor first as you may need extra care and your medications may need to be changed. \n There's a risk of pregnant women with hepatitis B passing the infection on\u00a0to their child around the time of the birth, but this risk can be reduced by ensuring the baby is vaccinated shortly after they're born.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

This hearing loss increases as you get older. By the age of 80, most people have significant hearing problems. \n As your hearing starts to deteriorate, high-frequency sounds, such as female or children\u2019s voices, may become difficult to hear. It may also be harder to hear consonants such as \"s\", \"f\" and \"th\". This can make understanding speech in background noise very difficult. \n Loud noises \n Another common cause of hearing loss is damage to the ear from repeated exposure to loud noises over time. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss, and it occurs when the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea become damaged. \n You're at higher risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss if you: \n \n work with noisy equipment, such as pneumatic drills or compressed-air hammers \n work in environments where there's loud music, such as a nightclub \n regularly listen to music at a high volume through headphones \n \n Hearing loss can also occur suddenly\u00a0after exposure to\u00a0an exceptionally loud noise, such as an explosion. This is known as acoustic trauma. \n See\u00a0 preventing hearing loss \u00a0for advice on reducing your risk of noise-induced hearing loss. \n Other types of sensorineural hearing\u00a0loss \n Sensorineural hearing loss occurs if the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea are damaged, or as a result of damage to the auditory nerve (which transmits sound to the brain). In some cases, both may be damaged. \n Hearing loss caused by age and exposure to loud noises are both types of sensorineural hearing loss. \n Sensorineural hearing loss can\u00a0also\u00a0be caused by: \n \n the genes you inherit \u2013\u00a0some people may be\u00a0born deaf or become deaf over time\u00a0because of\u00a0a genetic abnormality \n viral infections of the inner ear \u2013\u00a0such as  mumps  or\u00a0 measles  \n viral infections of the auditory nerve \u2013\u00a0such as mumps or rubella \n M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where\u00a0a person suffers with vertigo, spells of hearing loss,\u00a0 tinnitus  and the feeling of a blockage in the ear \n acoustic neuroma\u00a0\u2013 a non-cancerous (benign) growth on or near the auditory nerve \n  meningitis \u00a0\u2013 an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord \n encephalitis\u00a0\u2013 inflammation\u00a0of the brain \n  multiple sclerosis \u00a0\u2013 a neurological condition affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) \n a head injury \n an autoimmune condition \n malformation of the ear \n  stroke \u00a0\u2013 where the blood supply to the brain is cut off or interrupted \n \n Some\u00a0treatments and medicines, such as  radiotherapy \u00a0for nasal and sinus cancer, certain  chemotherapy \u00a0medicines or certain\u00a0 antibiotics  can also damage the cochlea and the auditory nerve, causing sensorineural hearing loss. \n People with  diabetes ,\u00a0 chronic kidney disease  and\u00a0 cardiovascular disease  are also at increased risk of hearing loss. \n Sensorineural hearing loss is permanent and hearing aids are often required to improve hearing in these cases.\u00a0 \n Causes of conductive hearing loss \n Conductive hearing loss is usually caused by a blockage, such as having too much ear wax, a build-up of fluid in the ear\u00a0(glue ear), or an  ear infection . \n Conductive hearing loss can also be caused by: \n \n a perforated eardrum\u00a0\u2013 where the eardrum is torn or has a hole in it \n otosclerosis\u00a0\u2013 an abnormal growth of bone in the middle ear which causes the inner hearing bone (the stapes) to be less mobile and less effective at transmitting sound \n damage to the hearing bones from injury, a collapsed ear drum or conditions such as\u00a0cholesteatoma \n swelling around the eustachian tube\u00a0\u2013\u00a0caused by jaw surgery or radiotherapy for nasal and sinus cancer \n malformation of the ear \n Eustachian tube dysfunction \n something becoming trapped in the ear (a foreign body) \n \n Conductive hearing loss is usually temporary and can often be treated with medication or minor surgery. \n Read more about  treating hearing loss", "treatment": "How hearing loss is treated depends on the underlying cause of the condition. \n Hearing loss that occurs when sounds are unable to pass into the inner ear (conductive hearing loss) is often temporary and treatable. \n For example,\u00a0 earwax build-up  can be removed by drops, a syringe or suction. Hearing loss caused by a bacterial infection can be treated with\u00a0 antibiotics . Surgery can be used to drain a fluid build-up, repair\u00a0a\u00a0perforated eardrum, or correct problems with the hearing bones. \n However, hearing loss caused by\u00a0damage to the inner ear or to the\u00a0nerves that transmit sound to brain (sensorineural hearing loss) is permanent. \n If your hearing is impaired,\u00a0treatment can improve your hearing and quality of life. Some of these treatments are discussed below. \n Hearing aids \n If you have\u00a0hearing problems, you may be able to wear a hearing aid.\u00a0About 1.4 million people regularly use hearing aids in the UK, and many more would benefit from them. \n A hearing aid is an electronic device that consists of a microphone, an amplifier, a loudspeaker\u00a0and a battery. It increases the volume of sound entering your ear, so you\u00a0can hear things more clearly. \n The microphone picks up sound, which is made louder by the amplifier. Hearing aids are fitted with devices that can distinguish between background noise, such as traffic, and foreground noise, such as conversation. \n Modern hearing aids are very small and discreet, and can often be worn inside your ear. \n Hearing aids help improve hearing, but don't give you your hearing back. They're suitable for most people, but may be less effective for people with\u00a0profound hearing impairment or certain conditions. Your GP or audiologist (hearing specialist) can advise you about whether a hearing aid is suitable for you. \n If a hearing aid is recommended, an audiologist\u00a0may take an impression of your ear so the hearing aid fits you perfectly or may show you an open fit hearing aid. The hearing aid will be adjusted to suit your level of hearing impairment. You'll also be shown how to use and care for it. \n After your hearing aid has been fitted, you should\u00a0have\u00a0a follow-up appointment\u00a0within 12 weeks. \n If you experience problems using a hearing aid \u2013 such as distortion and repeated infections \u2013 that can't be corrected by an audiologist, you may benefit from different\u00a0treatments. An ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon can discuss these with you. An ENT surgeon with a special interest in ear surgery is called an otologist. \n NHS hearing aids \n The NHS\u00a0loans\u00a0hearing aids to people with hearing loss free of charge. This\u00a0includes free repairs, batteries and servicing. Many areas now charge for lost hearing aids, but you'll be told about any costs at your fitting appointment. \n In the UK, both analogue and digital hearing aids are commonly used. Most hearing aids prescribed through the NHS are now digital. \n Instead of having moving parts, digital hearing aids contain a very small computer that processes sounds. This enables the hearing aid to be programmed to suit different environments, such as a small, quiet room or a large, noisy workshop. \n The type of digital hearing aids available through the NHS are usually the behind-the-ear (BTE) type (see below). Other types of hearing aid\u00a0may be\u00a0issued in cases where a medical condition prevents an individual from using BTE hearing aids. You can also choose to pay privately for another type of hearing aid if it's not available on the NHS. \n Types of hearing aids \n The\u00a0different types of hearing aids are described below. \n Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids \n BTE hearing aids usually have an earmould, which sits inside your ear. The rest of the hearing aid is connected to the earmould and lies behind your ear. \n Some types of BTE hearing aids have two microphones that enable you to listen to sounds in the general vicinity or to focus on sounds that are coming from a specific direction. This can be particularly useful in noisy environments. \n Open fit hearing aids may also be available, which are suitable for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The tube sits in the ear, instead of an earmould. \n Receiver in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids \n Receiver in-the ear (RITE) hearing aids are similar to BTE hearing aids, but the piece worn behind the ear is connected\u00a0by a wire to a receiver (loudspeaker) located within the ear canal. \n This means RITE hearing aids are usually less visible than BTE devices. \n In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids \n In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids are like an earmould. They fill the area just outside your ear canal and fill the opening of your ear canal. \n The working parts of the hearing aid are inside the shell. \n In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids \n In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids fill the outer part of the ear canal and are just visible. \n Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids \n Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids are even smaller and less visible than ITE or ITC hearing aids. \n However, they may not be recommended if you have severe hearing loss or frequent ear infections. \n Body-worn (BW) hearing aids \n Body-worn (BW) hearing aids have a small box containing the microphone. The box can be clipped to your clothes or you can put it inside a pocket. A lead connects the box to an earphone, which delivers sound to your ear. \n This type of hearing aid is an option for people with poor dexterity, who require a high-powered hearing aid. \n CROS/BiCROS \n CROS hearing aids are recommended for people who only have hearing in one ear. They work by picking up sounds from the side that doesn't have hearing and transmitting them to the ear that's able to hear. The sound is sometimes transmitted through wires, although wireless models are available. \n BiCROS hearing aids work in a similar way to CROS hearing aids, but they amplify the noise entering the ear that's able to hear. They're useful for people who don't have any hearing in one ear, with some\u00a0hearing loss in the other ear. \n Bone conduction hearing aids \n Bone conduction hearing aids are recommended for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who can't wear a more conventional type of hearing aid. Bone conduction hearing aids vibrate in response to the sounds going into the microphone. \n They can also sometimes help people with no hearing in one ear and normal or mild hearing loss in the other ear. \n The part of the hearing aid that vibrates is held against the bone behind the ear (mastoid) by a headband. The vibrations pass through the mastoid bone to the cochlea and are converted into sound in the usual way. They can be very effective, but can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods. \n Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA) \n A Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) transmits sound directly to the cochlea by vibrating the mastoid bone. A minor operation is needed to fix a screw to the skull, on which the hearing aid can be clipped on and off. A BAHA is removed at night and when you swim or take a shower. \n Unlike a bone conduction hearing aid, it's not uncomfortable to wear and is used for patients with conductive hearing loss, or in some patients who have no hearing in one of their ears. \n Some people may benefit from newer types of implantable bone conduction hearing aids that are held onto the head with magnets instead of a connector through the skin. However, these are only available at some BAHA centres and may require a referral to a different BAHA centre. \n Middle ear implants \n These are surgically implanted devices that attach to the hearing bones and make them vibrate. \n They're suitable for people who can't use a hearing aid, but have hearing loss at a level where a BAHA would not help. \n Disposable hearing aids \n Disposable hearing aids are sometimes recommended for people who have mild to moderate hearing loss. \n The battery inside a disposable hearing aid usually lasts for about 12 weeks, after which time the hearing aid is thrown away and replaced. Disposable hearing aids\u00a0tend to be\u00a0expensive in the long term\u00a0and are only available privately. \n Cochlear implants \n Cochlear implants are small hearing devices fitted under the skin behind\u00a0your ear during surgery. \n They have an external sound processor and internal parts, including a receiver coil, an electronics package and a long wire with electrodes on it (an electrode array). \n The external processor takes in sound, analyses it and then converts it to signals that are transmitted across the skin to an internal receiver-stimulator, which sends the signals along the electrode array into a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. The signal is then sent to the brain along the hearing nerve as normal. This means cochlear implants are only suitable for people whose hearing nerves are functioning normally. \n A cochlear implant is sometimes recommended\u00a0for adults or children who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss\u00a0in both\u00a0ears, which isn't helped by hearing aids.\u00a0 \n Both ears are usually implanted for children, whereas adults are usually only\u00a0able to have\u00a0one implant on the NHS. \n Before a cochlear implant is recommended, you'll be assessed to find out whether it will help improve your hearing. During the assessment, any disabilities or communication problems you have will be taken into consideration, which may mean the usual hearing tests aren't suitable. \n If a cochlear implant is recommended, it will be inserted into your ear (or both ears)\u00a0during an operation and switched on a\u00a0few weeks later. \n There are currently around 11,000 people in the UK with cochlear implants and the number is increasing each year. \n Safety \n According to the Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), evidence suggests that patients with cochlear implants may be at an increased risk from pneumococcal meningitis, especially if they haven't been immunised against pneumococcal disease.\u00a0 \n In August 2002, the Department of Health included cochlear implant patients in the population groups who should be immunised against pneumococcal infection.\u00a0 \n Although the risk of contracting bacterial meningitis is low, it's slightly higher than for the general population. \n Auditory brainstem implants \n In some cases of severe to profound\u00a0hearing loss, where there are problems with\u00a0the\u00a0nerve that transmits sound to the brain, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be used. \n An ABI is an electrical device made\u00a0up of: \n \n electrodes implanted into the part of the brain responsible for processing sound (in the brainstem) \n a receiver device placed\u00a0under the skin\u00a0behind your ear \n a small sound processor\u00a0outside your ear \n \n When\u00a0the microphone in the sound processor picks up sound, it turns it into an electrical signal and\u00a0transmits this to the brain through the receiver and electrodes. \n An ABI will not fully restore your hearing, but it can usually restore some degree of hearing and can make lip-reading easier. It's\u00a0often used as a treatment for hearing loss associated with a condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). \n Lip reading and\u00a0sign language \n Hearing\u00a0loss can sometimes affect your speech, as well as your ability to understand other people. Many people with significant hearing\u00a0loss learn to communicate in other ways instead of, or as well as, spoken English. \n For people who experience hearing loss after they've learnt to talk, lip-reading can be a very useful skill. Lip-reading is where you watch a person\u2019s mouth movements while they're speaking, to understand what they're saying. \n For people born with a hearing impairment, lip-reading is much more difficult. Those who are born with a hearing impairment often learn  sign language , such as British Sign Language (BSL), which is a form of communication that uses hand movements and facial expressions to convey meaning. \n BSL is completely different from spoken English and has its own grammar and syntax (word order). Other types of sign language include Signed English and Paget Gorman Signed Speech. \n The\u00a0 Action on Hearing Loss \u00a0website has more information on  British Sign Language (BSL) \u00a0and  lip-reading .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you're having problems with your hearing. They'll examine your ears and carry out some simple hearing tests. \n You may also want to visit the\u00a0 Action on Hearing Loss  website for an  online hearing test . \n Ear examination \n During an ear examination, an instrument with a light at the end called an auriscope (or otoscope) is used to look for anything abnormal, including: \n \n a blockage caused by\u00a0 earwax , fluid or an object \n an ear canal infection \n a bulging ear drum\u00a0\u2013 indicating\u00a0an\u00a0 infection inside the\u00a0middle ear  \n fluid behind the ear drum\u00a0\u2013\u00a0known as  glue ear  \n a perforated ear drum\u00a0 \n a collapsed ear drum \n skin collected in the middle ear (cholesteatoma) \n \n Your GP will ask\u00a0if you have any pain in your ear and when you first noticed the hearing loss. \n Referral to a specialist \n Your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiologist (a hearing specialist). The specialist will carry out further hearing tests to help determine what's causing your hearing loss and recommend the best course of treatment. \n Some of the hearing tests you may have include a: \n \n tuning fork test (sometimes performed by your GP) \n pure tone audiometry \n bone conduction test \n \n These tests are described below. \n Tuning fork test \n A tuning fork is a Y-shaped, metallic object. It produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it's gently tapped and can be used to test different aspects of your hearing. \n The tester taps the tuning fork on their elbow or knee to make it vibrate, before holding it at different places around your head. \n This test can help determine if you have conductive hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by sounds not being able to pass freely into the inner ear, or sensorineural hearing loss, where the inner ear or hearing nerve isn't working properly. \n Pure tone audiometry \n Pure tone audiometry\u00a0tests the hearing of both ears. During the test, a machine called an audiometer produces sounds at various volumes and frequencies (pitches). You listen to the sounds through headphones and respond when you hear them, usually by pressing a button. \n Bone conduction test \n A bone conduction test is often carried out as part of a routine pure tone audiometry test in adults. It's used to check if you have sensorineural hearing loss, by testing how well your inner ear is working. \n Bone conduction involves placing a vibrating probe against the mastoid bone behind the ear. It tests how well sounds transmitted through the bone are heard. \n Bone conduction is a more sophisticated version of the tuning fork test, and when used together with pure tone audiometry, it can help to determine whether hearing loss comes from the outer and middle ear (conductive hearing loss), the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), or both. \n Read about  how hearing tests are performed  \n Newborn hearing screening \n All newborn babies are offered a hearing test in the first few weeks after birth as part of the\u00a0NHS\u00a0Newborn Hearing Screening Programme. \n The tests helps to identify babies who have permanent hearing loss as soon as possible so that parents can get the support and advice they need. \n Read more about  the newborn hearing test  \n Levels of hearing loss \n Very few people with hearing loss hear nothing at all. There are four different levels of hearing loss, which are defined by the quietest sound you're able to hear, measured in decibels (dB). These are described below. \n Mild deafness \n If you're mildly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 21 to 40dB. Mild deafness can sometimes make\u00a0hearing speech difficult, particularly in noisy situations. \n Moderate deafness \n If you're moderately deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 41 to 70dB. You may have difficulty following speech without using a hearing aid\u00a0and may find it difficult to hear announcements, for example. \n Severe deafness \n If you're severely deaf, the quietest sound you're able to hear is 71 to 90dB. People who are severely deaf usually need to lip-read or use sign language, even with the use of a hearing aid. \n Profound deafness \n If you're profoundly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is more than 90dB. People who are profoundly deaf\u00a0can benefit from a cochlear implant. Other forms of communication include lip reading and British sign language or signed English. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating hearing impairment , including different types of hearing aids and sign language."},

They usually last for 30 minutes to several hours,\u00a0but can last for several days. \n The exact cause is unclear, but tension headaches have been linked to things such as stress, poor posture, skipping meals and\u00a0 dehydration . \n Tension headaches can\u00a0usually be treated with\u00a0ordinary\u00a0painkillers such as\u00a0 paracetamol  and  ibuprofen . Lifestyle changes, such as getting regular sleep, reducing stress and staying well hydrated, may also help. \n Migraines \n Migraines are less common than tension headaches.\u00a0They're usually felt as a\u00a0severe, throbbing pain at the front or side of the head. Some people also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light or sound. \n Migraines tend to be more severe than tension headaches and can stop you carrying out your normal daily activities.\u00a0They usually last at least a couple of hours, and some people find they need to stay in bed for days at a time. \n Most people can\u00a0treat their migraines successfully with over-the-counter medication. But if they're severe, you may need stronger medication that's only available on prescription. This may be able to relieve and prevent\u00a0your migraines. \n Read more about\u00a0 migraines  \n Cluster headaches \n Cluster headaches are a rare\u00a0type of headache that occur in clusters for a month or two at a time around the same time of year. \n They're excruciatingly painful, causing intense pain around one eye, and often occur with other symptoms, such as a watering or red eye and a blocked or runny nose. \n Pharmacy medications don't ease the symptoms of a cluster headache, but a doctor can prescribe specific treatments to ease the pain and help prevent further attacks. \n Medication and painkiller headaches \n Some headaches are a side effect of taking a particular medication. Frequent headaches can also be caused by taking too many painkillers. This is known as a painkiller or medication-overuse headache. \n A medication-overuse headache will usually\u00a0get better\u00a0within a few weeks once you stop taking the painkillers that are causing it, although your pain may get worse for a few days before it starts to improve. \n Hormone headaches \n Headaches in women are often caused by hormones, and many women notice a link with their periods. The  combined contraceptive pill , the  menopause  and pregnancy are also potential triggers. \n Reducing your stress levels, having a regular sleeping pattern, and ensuring you don't miss meals may help reduce headaches associated with your menstrual cycle. \n Other causes of headaches \n Headaches can also have a number of other causes, including: \n \n drinking too much alcohol \n a  head injury  or  concussion  \n a  cold \u00a0or  flu  \n temporomandibular disorders\u00a0\u2013 problems\u00a0affecting the\u00a0\"chewing\" muscles and the joints between the lower jaw and the base of the skull \n  sinusitis \u00a0\u2013 inflammation of the lining of the sinuses \n carbon monoxide poisoning \n  sleep apnoea \u00a0\u2013 a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing \n \n Could it be something serious? \n In the vast majority of cases, a headache isn't a sign of a serious problem. But, rarely, it can be a symptom of a condition such as a  stroke ,  meningitis ,\u00a0or a  brain tumour . \n A headache is more likely to be serious if: \n \n it occurs suddenly and is very severe\u00a0\u2013\u00a0often described as a blinding pain unlike anything experienced before \n it doesn't go away and gets worse over time \n it occurs after a\u00a0 severe head injury  \n it's triggered\u00a0suddenly by coughing, laughing, sneezing,\u00a0changes in posture, or physical exertion \n you have symptoms suggesting a problem with your brain or nervous system, including weakness,\u00a0slurred speech, confusion, memory loss, and drowsiness \n you have additional symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever), a\u00a0stiff neck,\u00a0a rash, jaw pain while chewing, vision problems, a sore scalp, or severe pain and redness in one of your eyes \n \n If you're concerned that your headache might be serious, you should seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service\u00a0as soon as possible, or go to  your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

They should pass within a week. \n Spotty rash and blisters \n Soon after the mouth ulcers appear, you'll probably notice a rash made up of small, raised red spots on the skin. \n These typically develop on the fingers, the backs or palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and occasionally on the buttocks and groin. \n The spots\u00a0may then turn into small\u00a0 blisters  with a grey centre. \n The\u00a0spots and blisters can sometimes be\u00a0itchy or uncomfortable and typically\u00a0last up to 10\u00a0days. \n What to do if you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease \n If you have hand, foot and mouth disease, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you're feeling better. There's no cure for it, so you have to let it run its course. \n To help ease your or your child's symptoms: \n \n drink plenty of fluidsto\u00a0avoid  dehydration \u00a0\u2013 water or milk are ideal; it may help to give\u00a0a baby smaller but more frequent bottle or breast milk feeds \n eat\u00a0soft foods such as mashed potatoes, yoghurt\u00a0and soups if eating and swallowing is uncomfortable \u2013 avoid hot, acidic or spicy foods and drinks \n take over-the-counter painkillers, such as  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen , to\u00a0ease a sore throat and fever \u2013 aspirin shouldn't be given to children under the age of 16;\u00a0paracetamol is best if you're pregnant \n try gargling with warm, salty water to relieve discomfort from mouth ulcers \u2013\u00a0it's important\u00a0not to swallow the mixture, so this isn't recommended for young children \n alternatively, use mouth gels, rinses or sprays for mouth ulcers \u2013\u00a0these are available from pharmacies, but aren't routinely recommended, and some aren't suitable for young children; ask your pharmacist for advice and make sure you read the instructions first \n \n You should keep your child away from nursery or school until they're feeling better.\u00a0Adults with the condition should stay away from work until they're feeling better. \n See\u00a0 preventing hand, foot and mouth disease  below for more information about stopping\u00a0the infection spreading. \n When to get medical advice \n You don't usually need medical attention if you think you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease. The infection will usually pass in 7 to 10 days, and there isn't much your doctor can do. \n  Antibiotics \u00a0won't help\u00a0as hand, foot and mouth\u00a0disease is caused by a virus. \n If you're unsure whether you or your child has hand, foot and mouth disease, you can\u00a0call the\u00a0NHS 24 '111' service\u00a0or your GP for advice. \n You should also get medical\u00a0advice if: \n \n your child is unable or unwilling to drink any fluids \n your child has  signs of dehydration ,\u00a0such as\u00a0unresponsiveness, passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or cold hands and feet \n your child develops fits (seizures), confusion, weakness or a loss of consciousness \n your child is under\u00a0three months old and has a temperature of 38C (101F) or above, or is between three and six months old and has a temperature of 39C (102F) or above \n the skin becomes very painful, red, swollen and hot, or there's a discharge of pus \n the symptoms are getting worse or haven't improved after 7 to 10 days \n \n Get advice from your GP if you're pregnant and you\u00a0become infected within a few weeks of your due date. Infection in pregnancy is usually nothing to worry about, but there's a small chance it could make your baby ill if you're infected\u00a0shortly before you give birth. \n Read more about the  risks of hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy  \n How hand, foot and mouth disease spreads \n Someone\u00a0with hand, foot and mouth disease is most infectious from just before their symptoms start until they're feeling better. \n The infection can be spread by close person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus is found in: \n \n the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of an infected person \u2013 you can become infected if you get these on your hands and then touch your mouth, or if you breathe in the droplets \n an infected person's poo \u2013 if an infected person doesn't wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, they can contaminate food or surfaces \n an infected person's saliva or fluid from their blisters \u2013 you can become infected if this gets in your mouth \n \n The infection is caused by a\u00a0number of different viruses, so it's possible to get it more than once. Most\u00a0people develop immunity to these viruses as they get older. \n Preventing hand, foot and mouth disease \n It's not always possible to avoid getting hand, foot and mouth disease, but following the advice below can help stop the infection spreading. \n \n Stay off work, school or nursery until you or your child\u00a0are feeling better \u2013 there's usually no need to wait until the last blister has healed, provided you're otherwise well. \n Use tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and put used tissues in a bin as soon as possible. \n Wash your hands with soap and water often \u2013 particularly after going to the toilet, coughing, sneezing or handling nappies, and before preparing food. \n Avoid sharing cups,\u00a0utensils, towels and clothes with people who are infected. \n Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated \u2013 it's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. \n Wash\u00a0any bedding or clothing\u00a0that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hay fever", "introduction": "Hay fever is a common allergic condition that affects up to one in five people at some point in their life. \n  Symptoms of hay fever \u00a0include: \n \n sneezing \n a runny nose \n itchy eyes \n \n You'll experience hay fever symptoms if you have an allergic reaction to pollen. \n Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle. It contains proteins that can cause the nose, eyes, throat and sinuses (small air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead) to become swollen, irritated and inflamed. \n You can have an allergy to: \n \n tree pollen, released during spring \n grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer \n weed pollen, released late autumn \n \n Read more about the  causes of hay fever . \n Many people find their symptoms improve as they get older. Around half of people report some improvement in symptoms after several years. Symptoms disappear completely in around 10-20% of people. \n Hay fever treatment \n There's currently no cure for hay fever, but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent. \n The most effective way to control hay fever would be to avoid exposure to pollen. However, it's very difficult to avoid pollen, particularly during the summer months when you want to spend more time outdoors. \n  Treatment options for hay fever \u00a0include antihistamines, which can help to prevent an allergic reaction from occurring and  corticosteroids (steroids) , which help to reduce inflammation and swelling. \n Hay fever can often be controlled using over-the-counter medication from your pharmacist. However, if your symptoms are more troublesome it\u2019s worth speaking to your GP, as you may require prescription medication. \n For severe and\u00a0persistent hay fever, there's also a type of treatment called immunotherapy. It involves being exposed to small amounts of pollen over time, to build resistance to its allergic effects. However, this can take many months or even years to work. \n Read more about  treating hay fever . \n Who's affected \n Hay fever is one of the most common allergic conditions. It's estimated that there are more than 10 million people with hay fever in England. \n You can get hay fever at any age,\u00a0although\u00a0it usually begins in childhood or during the teenage years. It's more common in boys than girls. In adults, men and women are equally affected. \n You're more likely to develop hay fever if you have\u00a0a family history of  allergies , particularly\u00a0 asthma  or  eczema . \n Self-help tips \n It's sometimes possible to prevent the symptoms of hay fever by taking some basic precautions, such as: \n \n wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting in your eyes when you're outdoors \n taking a shower and changing your clothes after being outdoors to remove the pollen on your body \n staying indoors when the\u00a0pollen count is high (over 50 grains per cubic metre of air) \n applying a small amount of Vaseline (petroleum gel) to the nasal openings to trap pollen grains \n \n Read more about  preventing hay fever . \n Complications \n Even though hay fever doesn't pose a serious threat to health, it can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life. People with very severe hay fever often find that it can disrupt their productivity at school or work. \n Inflammation of the sinuses ( sinusitis ) is another common complication of hay fever. Children may also develop a  middle ear infection (otitis media)  as a result of hay fever. \n Read more about the  complications of hay fever .", "symptoms": "Hay fever symptoms vary in severity and may be worse some years, depending on the weather conditions and pollen count. \n The time of year your symptoms start will depend on the types of pollen you're allergic to. \n The symptoms of hay fever include: \n \n frequent sneezing \n runny or blocked nose \n itchy, red or watery eyes (allergic  conjunctivitis ) \n an itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears \n  cough , caused by\u00a0postnasal drip (mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose) \n \n Less commonly, you may also experience: \n \n the loss of your sense of smell (anosmia) \n facial pain (caused by blocked sinuses) \n  headaches  \n  earache  \n tiredness and fatigue \n \n Even though your hay fever symptoms may be mild, they can interfere with your sleep and your daily activities at school or work. \n Hay fever and asthma \n If you have  asthma , your\u00a0 asthma symptoms  may get worse when you have hay fever. Sometimes, the symptoms of asthma only occur when you have hay fever. These symptoms include: \n \n tight chest \n  shortness of breath \u00a0 \n coughing \n wheezing \n \n Pollen count \n Hay fever symptoms are likely to be worse if the pollen count is high. The pollen count is the number of grains of pollen in one cubic metre of air. \n Air samples are collected in traps set on buildings 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0storeys high. Taking samples from this height gives a better indication of the pollen in the air. Traps on the ground would only collect pollen from nearby trees and plants. \n The air is sucked into the trap and the grains of pollen are collected on either sticky tape or microscope slides (glass plates). The pollen is then counted. Samples are normally taken every 2\u00a0hours, and usually the results are averaged\u00a0over a 24-hour period. \n The pollen forecast is usually given as: \n \n low \u2013 less than 30 grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air \n moderate \u2013 30 to 49 grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air \n high \u2013\u00a050 to 149 grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air \n very high \u2013 150 or more grains of pollen in every cubic metre of air \n \n Hay fever symptoms often begin when the pollen count is over 50. The pollen count is usually given as part of the weather forecast during the spring and summer months. \n When to seek medical advice \n Most cases of hay fever can be treated using over-the-counter medication. Your local pharmacist can advise you on treatments for you or your children. \n You usually only need to see your GP if: \n \n you can't control your symptoms with over-the-counter medications, or\u00a0you have troublesome side effects caused by the medication \n you're experiencing persistent  complications of hay fever , such as worsening of asthma or repeated episodes of  sinusitis  \n the pattern of your symptoms is unusual, such as occurring during the winter or only at your workplace (it's likely that another substance other than pollen is responsible, and further testing will be needed to confirm this)", "causes": "Hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen. When these tiny particles come into contact with the cells that line your mouth, nose, eyes and throat, they irritate them and trigger an allergic reaction. \n Allergic reaction \n When you have an allergic reaction, your body overreacts to something it perceives as a threat. In hay fever, the allergen (the substance you're allergic to) is pollen. Your immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence) responds as if it were being attacked by a virus. \n Your immune system will release a number of chemicals designed to prevent the spread of what it wrongly perceives as an infection. These chemicals cause the symptoms of the allergic reaction, such as watering eyes and a runny nose. \n Risk factors \n It's unclear what causes the immune system to react in this way, but there are several factors that can increase your risk of developing hay fever. They include: \n \n having  asthma  or another allergic condition, such as  eczema  \n having a family history of hay fever \n being exposed to tobacco smoke and diesel exhaust particles during early childhood \n \n Most people with hay fever are allergic to grass pollen, but it can also be caused by trees and weeds. Research suggests that pollution, such as cigarette smoke or car exhaust fumes, can make  allergies  worse. \n Pollen \n There are around 30 types of pollen that could cause your hay fever. The pollen that causes hay fever can come from a number of sources, including: \n \n grass \u2013\u00a0in the UK, about 9 out of 10 (90%) of people with hay fever are allergic to Timothy and Rye grass pollen \n trees \u2013\u00a0about 1 in 4 (25%) of people\u00a0with hay fever\u00a0in the UK are allergic to pollen from trees, including oak, ash, cedar and birch (people with an allergy to birch often also experience an allergic reaction to apples, peaches, plums and cherries because\u00a0these types of fruit contain a similar protein to birch pollen) \n weeds \u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0dock, mugwort and nettles;\u00a0being allergic to weeds is less common and tends to occur during the autumn\u00a0 \n \n It's possible to be allergic to more than one type of pollen. \n When is there most pollen? \n Different trees and plants produce their pollen at different times of the year. Depending on which type of pollen you're allergic to, you may experience hay fever symptoms at different times. \n In the UK, the pollen count\u00a0season is usually separated into 3\u00a0periods: \n \n tree pollen \u2013 late March to mid-May \n grass pollen \u2013 mid-May to July \n weed pollen \u2013 end of June to September \n \n However, the pollen count season can sometimes begin as early as January or end in November. For example, depending on the weather conditions, sometimes there can be an \"early spring\" or a\u00a0\"long summer\". \n The effect of the weather \n The amount of sunshine, rain or wind affects how much pollen plants release and how much it's spread around. On humid and windy days, pollen spreads easily. On rainy days, pollen may be cleared from the air, causing pollen levels to fall. \n During their pollen season, plants release pollen early in the morning. As the day gets warmer and more flowers open, pollen levels rise. On sunny days, the\u00a0pollen count is highest in the early evening.", "treatment": "Before going to see your GP, you could visit your pharmacist and try to treat your hay fever symptoms with over-the-counter medications, such as antihistamines. \n Make an appointment to see\u00a0your GP if\u00a0your symptoms don't improve after using antihistamines. You may need treatment with prescription medications, such as nasal steroid medication ( corticosteroids ). \n The various treatments for hay fever are outlined below. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines treat hay fever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it's under attack from an allergen. This stops the symptoms of the allergic reaction. \n Antihistamines are usually effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they may not help\u00a0with clearing a blocked nose. \n They're available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays and eye drops. \n You can use antihistamines as: \n \n an \"as-required\" treatment \u2013 you take them when you first notice you're developing the symptoms of hay fever \n a preventative treatment \u2013 for example, if you know there's going to be a high pollen count, you can take them before leaving the house in the morning \n \n Different antihistamine tablets for hay fever include cetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine. Azelastine is an effective antihistamine nasal\u00a0spray and olopatadine is an antihistamine eye drop. \n Unlike older antihistamines, these newer types shouldn't cause drowsiness, although this can occasionally happen to some people. \n If you do become drowsy after using\u00a0antihistamines, you should avoid driving or using heavy tools or machinery. You should also contact your GP or pharmacist, as there may be an alternative antihistamine you can take. \n Corticosteroid nasal sprays and drops \n Corticosteroids (steroids) are used to treat hay fever because they have an anti-inflammatory effect. \n When pollen triggers your allergic reaction, the inside of your nose becomes inflamed. Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever. \n Your GP may prescribe corticosteroid nasal sprays or drops instead of antihistamines if: \n \n you have persistent hay fever that doesn't respond to antihistamines \n your main symptom is a blocked nose \n you're pregnant or breastfeeding \n \n Corticosteroid nose drops (containing betamethasone and fluticasone) are more powerful than corticosteroid nose sprays and shouldn't be used for prolonged periods of more than 2\u00a0to 4\u00a0weeks.\u00a0 \n Corticosteroids are better than antihistamine tablets at preventing and relieving nasal symptoms, including sneezing and congestion. They can also relieve itchy, watery eyes. They're most effective if you start using them a couple of weeks before your symptoms begin, and work best when used regularly. \n It's important that you read the instructions that come with your medication, as applying the drops or the spray incorrectly can increase your risk of developing side effects, such as: \n \n irritation and dryness of your nose \n bleeding from your nose \n unpleasant taste in your mouth \n itchy skin rash around your nose \n \n Corticosteroid tablets \n If you require rapid short-term relief from severe symptoms\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have an exam or driving test coming up\u00a0\u2013\u00a0your GP may prescribe a course of corticosteroid tablets for 5\u00a0to 7\u00a0days. \n The use of corticosteroids for longer than 10 days isn't recommended, because\u00a0the longer you take steroid tablets the more likely it is you'll begin to experience unpleasant side effects, such as: \n \n weight gain \n changes in mood, such as feeling irritable \n  acne \u00a0 \n \n Nasal decongestants \n Hay fever can cause a blocked nose. A decongestant, in the form of a nasal spray, can relieve this. Decongestants reduce the swelling of the blood vessels in your nose, which opens your nasal passage and makes breathing easier. \n Your GP can prescribe a nasal decongestant, but there are many available from your pharmacist. Check the ingredients, as some decongestants also contain antihistamine. If they do, they may relieve other symptoms as well. If not, the decongestant will only relieve your blocked nose. \n Nasal decongestants shouldn't be used for longer than 7\u00a0days. They may cause dryness and irritation in your nasal passage, and can make the symptoms of congestion worse (this is known as rebound congestion or rhinitis medicamentosa). \n Eye drops \n Eye drops are available from your pharmacist to treat the hay fever symptoms that affect your eyes, such as redness, itchiness and watering ( allergic conjunctivitis ). The\u00a0drops contain antihistamine, such as azelastine and olopatadine,\u00a0to reduce the inflammation in your eyes, which will relieve the symptoms. \n Eye drops containing the active ingredient sodium cromoglicate (a mast cell stabiliser) are the most widely used and have been shown to be extremely safe. Check the patient information leaflet for the correct way to use them. Some may cause side effects, such as a stinging or burning sensation in your eyes.\u00a0 \n Immunotherapy \n If you have persistent hay fever symptoms that aren't relieved by the above treatments, your GP may refer you for immunotherapy treatment. This involves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen (the substance you're allergic to), such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction in a controlled environment. \n Immunotherapy is only carried out in specialist medical centres, in case a serious allergic reaction, known as  anaphylaxis , occurs. \n The allergen can be given to you as: \n \n an injection into your skin \u2013 this is known as systemic injection immunotherapy (SIT) \n a tablet that dissolves under your tongue \u2013 this is known as sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) \n \n After the initial treatment, you'll be monitored for up to an hour. \n Further doses of\u00a0SLIT\u00a0can safely be administered at home after an initial dose has been given under medical supervision. \n To work in the first year, treatment should be started 3\u00a0months before the pollen season. As you get used to the allergen, the amount used will slowly be increased. You'll gradually start to build up immunity to the allergen, and your allergic reaction to it should get less severe. 3\u00a0years of treatment is recommended to achieve long-term pollen desensitisation. \n Immunotherapy\u00a0can improve your tolerance of the allergen, which can improve your quality of life and have long-term results. However, if you don't see a significant improvement in your symptoms during the first year, then the treatment is unlikely to help and shouldn't be continued.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP should be able to diagnose hay fever from a description of your symptoms. In some cases, you may be referred for allergy testing. \n A diagnosis for hay fever would usually only be required: \n \n if your symptoms were particularly severe \n the pattern of your symptoms was unusual\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have\u00a0symptoms during the winter or while indoors \n if you had experienced\u00a0 complications of hay fever  \n \n If possible, keep a diary of the times of day or year you experience your symptoms, as this can help with the diagnosis. \n Allergy\u00a0testing \n Your GP may refer you to an immunologist for an allergy test if you have  hay fever symptoms  all year round (called persistent  allergic rhinitis ), or symptoms that aren't responding to treatment. Other substances could be causing your allergy, such as house dust mites, animals or certain foods. \n The 2\u00a0main allergy tests are a skin prick test and a\u00a0 blood test . \n Skin prick test \n During a skin prick test, an\u00a0immunologist\u00a0will place the pollen allergen on your arm and prick the surface of your skin with a needle. This will introduce the allergen to your skin's immune system (mast cells)\u00a0and, if you're allergic to it, you should have a reaction on the skin. \n If your skin starts to go red around where it was pricked, swells up or becomes itchy, this could be an allergic reaction and would confirm that you have hay fever. \n A skin prick test may not be suitable if: \n \n you're on certain medications, such as\u00a0antihistamines, which will stop you having an allergic reaction \n you have significant  eczema , as your skin may already be red or itchy, so an allergic reaction won't be noticeable \n \n In this case, a blood test may be necessary to confirm your diagnosis (see below). \n The use of commercial home allergy testing kits isn't recommended. The testing is often of a lower standard than that provided by the NHS or accredited private clinics. It's also important that the test results are interpreted by a qualified professional who has detailed knowledge of your symptoms and medical history. \n Blood test \n A sample of blood will be taken from a vein in your arm and tested for the presence of the Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. \n If you have hay fever, your body produces this antibody when it comes into contact with pollen.

It's much less common in children. \n If you have gum disease, your\u00a0gums may bleed when\u00a0you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. \n If gingivitis isn't treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and\u00a0hold them in place. \n If\u00a0periodontitis\u00a0isn't treated, the bone in your jaw\u00a0may be damaged and small spaces can open up\u00a0between the gum and teeth.\u00a0Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out. \n Read more about the  symptoms of gum disease . \n What causes gum disease? \n Gum disease is caused by a build-up of plaque on the teeth. Plaque is a sticky substance that contains bacteria. \n Some bacteria in plaque\u00a0are harmless, but some are harmful for the health of your gums. If you don't remove plaque from your teeth by brushing them, it\u00a0builds up and irritates your gums. This can lead to redness with bleeding, swelling and soreness. \n Read more about the causes of gum disease. \n Seeing your dentist \n You should make an appointment to see your dentist if your gums are painful,\u00a0swollen\u00a0or if they bleed when you brush your teeth.  Find a dentist near you . \n Your dentist\u00a0can carry out a thorough dental examination to check the health of your gums, which may involve inserting a thin\u00a0metal stick with a bend in one end\u00a0(periodontal probe) beside your teeth. \n In some cases, a number of  X-rays  may be needed to check the condition of your teeth and jaw bone. \n Preventing and treating gum disease \n Mild cases of gum disease can usually be treated by maintaining a good level of oral hygiene. This includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day and flossing regularly. You should also make sure you attend regular dental check-ups. \n In most cases, your dentist or dental hygienist will be able to give your teeth a thorough clean and remove any hardened plaque (tartar). They'll also be able to show you how to clean your teeth effectively to help prevent plaque building up in the future. \n If you have severe gum disease, you'll\u00a0usually need to have further medical and dental treatment and, in some cases, surgery may need to be carried out.\u00a0This will usually be performed by a specialist in gum\u00a0problems (periodontics). \n Read more about  treating gum disease and keeping your teeth clean . \n Dental check-ups \n It's important\u00a0to have regular dental\u00a0check-ups so any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early. \n If you've never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every one to two\u00a0years for a check-up. \n You may need to visit your dentist more frequently if you've had problems with gum disease in the past. At each appointment your dentist will advise when you need your next appointment. \n If you have an increased risk of developing gum problems\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you smoke or have  diabetes \u00a0\u2013 you may be advised to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums can be closely monitored. \n Complications of gum disease \n If you have untreated gum disease that develops into periodontitis, it can lead to further complications, such as: \n \n  gum abscesses \u00a0(painful collections of pus) \n receding gums \n loose teeth \n loss of teeth \n \n Read more about the  complications of gum disease .", "symptoms": "Healthy gums should be pink, firm and keep your teeth securely in place. Your gums shouldn't bleed when you touch or brush them. \n Gum disease isn't always\u00a0painful and you may be unaware you have it. It's important to have regular  dental check-ups . \n Early symptoms \n The initial symptoms of gum disease can include: \n \n red and swollen\u00a0gums \n bleeding gums after brushing or flossing your teeth \n \n This stage of gum disease is called gingivitis. \n Advanced symptoms \n If\u00a0gingivitis is untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. This is known as\u00a0periodontitis, or periodontal disease. \n Symptoms of periodontitis can include: \n \n bad breath (halitosis) \n an\u00a0unpleasant\u00a0taste in your mouth \n loose teeth that can make eating difficult \n  gum abscesses \u00a0(collections of pus that\u00a0develop under your gums or\u00a0teeth) \n \n Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis \n In rare cases, a condition called\u00a0acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) can develop suddenly. The symptoms of ANUG are usually more severe than those of gum disease and can include: \n \n bleeding, painful gums \n painful ulcers \n receding gums inbetween your teeth \n bad breath \n a metallic taste in your mouth \n excess saliva in your mouth \n difficulty swallowing or talking \n a high temperature (fever) \n \n When to see a dentist \n You should make an appointment to see your dentist if you think you may have gum disease or ANUG. \n If you don't currently have a dentist,  search for a dentist near you . \n Read more about  treating gum disease .", "causes": "Gum disease can be caused by a number of factors, but poor oral hygiene is the most common cause. \n Poor oral hygiene, such as not brushing your teeth properly or regularly, can cause plaque\u00a0to build up on your teeth. \n Plaque \n Your mouth is full of bacteria that\u00a0combine with saliva to form a sticky film known as plaque, which\u00a0builds up on your teeth. \n When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates (sugary or starchy foods), bacteria in plaque turn carbohydrates into the energy they need, producing acid at the same time. \n Over time, acid in plaque begins to break down your tooth's surface and causes tooth decay. \n Other bacteria in plaque\u00a0can also\u00a0irritate your gums, making them inflamed and sore. \n Plaque is usually easy to remove by brushing\u00a0and flossing\u00a0your teeth, but it can harden and form a substance called\u00a0tartar\u00a0if it's not removed.\u00a0Tartar sticks much more firmly to teeth than plaque and can usually only be removed by a dentist or dental hygienist. \n Who is most at risk? \n As well as poor oral hygiene,\u00a0a number of things can increase your risk of developing problems with your gums. These include: \n \n  smoking \u00a0 \n your age\u00a0\u2013 gum disease\u00a0becomes more common as you get older \n a family history of gum disease \n  diabetes \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar levels to become too high \n a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example,\u00a0because of\u00a0conditions such as  HIV and AIDS  or\u00a0certain treatments, such as  chemotherapy  \n  malnutrition \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition that occurs when a person's diet does not contain the right amount of nutrients \n  stress", "treatment": "The best way to treat gum disease is to practise good oral hygiene, although additional dental and medical treatments are sometimes necessary. \n Oral hygiene \n Good oral hygiene involves: \n \n brushing your teeth for about two minutes last thing at night before you go to bed and on one other occasion everyday\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it doesn't matter if you use an electric or manual toothbrush but some people find it easier to clean their teeth thoroughly with an electric toothbrush \n using toothpaste that contains\u00a0the right amount of  fluoride  (a natural mineral that helps protect against  tooth decay ) \n  flossing \u00a0your teeth regularly\u00a0\u2013\u00a0preferably daily, before brushing your teeth \n not smoking \n regularly visiting your dentist \u2013 at least once every one to two\u00a0years, but more frequently if necessary \n \n See the  teeth cleaning guide \u00a0for more information and advice about how to keep your teeth clean. \n Mouthwash \n Antiseptic mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine or hexetidine are available over the counter from pharmacies. However,\u00a0there's some debate about whether using\u00a0mouthwash is\u00a0necessary for people with healthy gums. \n Your dentist may recommend using mouthwash if it helps control the build-up of plaque (the sticky substance that forms when bacteria collects on the surface of your teeth). Your dentist will be able to advise\u00a0you about which type of mouthwash is most suitable and how to use it. \n Chlorhexidine mouthwash can stain your teeth brown if you use it\u00a0regularly. Rinse your mouth thoroughly between brushing your teeth and using a chlorhexidine mouthwash because some ingredients in toothpaste can prevent the mouthwash working.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Dental treatments \n Some of the dental treatments described below may also be recommended if you have gum disease. \n Scale and polish \n To remove plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) that can build up on your teeth, your dentist may suggest that you have your teeth scaled and polished. This is a \"professional clean\" usually carried out at your dental surgery by a dental hygienist. \n The dental hygienist will scrape away plaque and tartar from your teeth using special instruments, then polish your teeth to remove marks or stains. If a lot of plaque or tartar has built up, you may need to have more than one scale and polish. \n The price of a scale and polish can vary depending on what needs to be carried out, so ask your dental hygienist how much it will cost beforehand. \n \u00a0 \n Root planing \n In some cases of gum disease, root planing (debridement) may be required. This is a deep clean under the gums that gets rid of bacteria from the roots of your teeth. \n Before having the treatment, you may need to have a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  (painkilling medication) to numb the area. You may experience some pain and discomfort for up to 48 hours after having root planing. \n Further treatment \n If you have severe gum disease, you may need further treatment, such as periodontal surgery. In some cases, it's necessary to remove the affected tooth. Your dentist will be able to tell you about the procedure needed and how it's carried out. If necessary, they can refer you to a specialist. \n If you're having surgery or root planing, you may be given antibiotics (medication to treat infections). Your dentist will tell you whether this is necessary. \n Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis \n Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) should always be treated by a dentist. However, if you see your GP before visiting a dentist, they may provide you with some treatment while you wait to see your dentist. \n As well as the oral hygiene advice and dental treatments mentioned above, treatments for ANUG may also include antibiotics, painkillers and\u00a0different types of mouthwash. These are described below. \n Antibiotics \n Treatment with\u00a0 antibiotics , such as metronidazole or amoxicillin, may be recommended if you have ANUG.\u00a0You'll usually have to take these for three days. \n Amoxicillin isn't suitable for people allergic to penicillin. Metronidazole can react with alcohol, causing you to feel very unwell. You shouldn't drink alcohol while you're taking metronidazole and for 48 hours after you finish the course of treatment. \n Other side effects of metronidazole and amoxicillin can include nausea (feeling sick), vomiting and  diarrhoea . \n Painkillers \n  Paracetamol \u00a0and\u00a0 ibuprofen  are the most commonly prescribed painkillers.\u00a0They're also available over the counter from pharmacies. They may help reduce pain and discomfort. \n However, paracetamol and ibuprofen aren't suitable for everyone, so read the manufacturer's instructions before taking them. \n Mouthwash \n Mouthwash containing chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide may be prescribed to treat ANUG. Some chlorhexidine mouthwashes are also available over the counter, though they may not be as effective as a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash. \n You should always read the instructions before using mouthwash. Some types may need to be diluted in water before they're taken.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Hairy cell leukaemia", "introduction": "Hairy cell leukaemia is a rare type of long-term (chronic) leukaemia. \n The condition gets its name from the fine, hair-like strands that develop around the outside of\u00a0the cancerous cells and are visible under\u00a0a microscope. \n It's not known what causes hairy cell leukaemia. \n Leukaemia \n Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. \n All the body's blood cells, including\u00a0red and white blood cells\u00a0and platelets, are produced by bone marrow. Bone marrow is a spongy tissue found inside the bones. It\u00a0also produces special cells called stem cells. \n In leukaemia, the cancer begins in the stem cells and causes them to produce more white blood cells than are needed. Over time, the\u00a0build-up of cancerous white blood cells disrupts the normal balance of cells in the blood. \n This means your body doesn't have enough red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body,\u00a0or platelets, which help stop bleeding. This can lead to the  symptoms of anaemia , such as tiredness, shortness of breath\u00a0and feeling faint, as well as increasing the risk of excessive bleeding. \n Also, as the white blood cells aren't properly developed, they're less effective at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. \n Hairy cell leukaemia \n The symptoms of hairy cell leukaemia develop slowly and are\u00a0similar to\u00a0those of\u00a0other types of leukaemia. They include: \n \n weight\u00a0loss\u00a0 \n pale skin \n weakness, tiredness and breathlessness (due a lack of red blood cells) \n frequent\u00a0infections (due to a lack of infection-fighting white blood cells) \n bleeding or bruising easily \n pain or swelling in your abdomen (tummy) (see below) \n \n The abnormal white blood cells can accumulate in your spleen, causing it to increase in size. The spleen is an organ\u00a0in the upper left side of your abdomen, behind your stomach and ribs. \n If your spleen is enlarged, it's likely you'll have a painful lump on the left side of your abdomen. If this is the case, you should visit your GP so the lump can be examined. \n An enlarged spleen may remove normal blood cells from your bloodstream. This can lead to a further reduction in the number of normal red and white blood cells and platelets in your blood. \n Diagnosis \n If\u00a0your GP\u00a0suspects leukaemia, they may refer you to a haematologist (a specialist in blood disorders). \n The haematologist will carry out\u00a0 blood tests \u00a0to determine how many\u00a0different types of blood cells there are in your blood sample. This is known as a full blood count (FBC) and will indicate the number of abnormal white blood cells you have. \n If you have hairy cell leukaemia, it's\u00a0likely your red blood cell and platelet counts will be low. \n A bone marrow\u00a0sample may also be taken which will give the haematologist more detailed information about your condition. \n An  ultrasound scan  or a  computerised tomography (CT)  scan may be needed to examine your spleen. \n Treatment \n As hairy cell leukaemia develops slowly, immediate treatment\u00a0may not be needed. You'll have regular blood tests to monitor your condition. \n Treatment may be recommended if\u00a0the number of abnormal white blood cells\u00a0increases or if you develop symptoms. \n A\u00a0number of different treatments are available for hairy cell leukaemia.\u00a0 Chemotherapy \u00a0is the main treatment and it's usually effective at destroying the cancerous cells. \n Other treatments are sometimes\u00a0used in combination with chemotherapy. \n Rituximab is a type of\u00a0medication known as a monoclonal antibody. It seeks out a protein found on leukaemia cells and attaches itself to it. The immune system then targets and kills the cells. \n Interferon is another medicine that can be used to treat hairy cell leukaemia. It\u00a0can\u00a0strengthen your immune system and help fight cancer. This type of treatment, known as immunotherapy, may be recommended\u00a0if you can't have chemotherapy or rituximab, or they're no longer working. \n Surgery to remove the spleen is rarely used\u00a0as a treatment for\u00a0hairy cell leukaemia.\u00a0However, removal of your spleen may be recommended if: \n \n it's enlarged and is causing pain or discomfort \n it's destroying large numbers of red blood cells or platelets \n it hasn't shrunk after chemotherapy \n \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about the  types of treatment for hairy cell leukaemia . \n Outlook \n As with most types of cancer, the outlook for hairy cell leukaemia will depend on how far the condition\u00a0has advanced at the time of diagnosis and how well it responds to treatment. \n As hairy cell leukaemia is a\u00a0rare type of cancer, it's difficult to accurately predict how it will affect individuals in the long-term.\u00a0 \n However, according to Cancer Research UK, at least 96 out of 100 people diagnosed with hairy cell leukaemia (96%) will live\u00a0at least 10 years after being\u00a0diagnosed.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Glandular fever", "introduction": "Glandular fever is a type of viral infection that mostly affects young adults. \n It is also known as\u00a0infectious mononucleosis, or \"mono\". \n Common symptoms include: \n \n a high temperature (fever) \n a severely\u00a0 sore throat  \n  swollen glands \u00a0in the neck \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n \n While the symptoms of glandular fever can be very unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months. \n Read more\u00a0about the\u00a0 symptoms of glandular fever . \n When to seek medical advice \n You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. \n While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others. \n You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department or dial 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you: \n \n develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties \n find swallowing fluids difficult \n develop intense abdominal pain \n \n These symptoms can be a sign of a complication of glandular fever that may need to be treated in hospital. \n What causes glandular fever? \n Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: \n \n kissing\u00a0\u2013 glandular fever is often referred to as the \"kissing disease\" \n exposure to coughs and sneezes \n sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery \n \n EBV may be found in the saliva of someone who has had glandular fever for several months after their symptoms pass, and some people may\u00a0continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. \n If you have EBV, it's a good idea to take steps to avoid infecting others\u00a0while you are ill,\u00a0such as not kissing other people, but there's no need\u00a0no need to\u00a0avoid all contact with others\u00a0as the chances of passing on the infection are generally low. \n Read more about the  causes of glandular fever . \n Who is affected? \n Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. \n Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only\u00a0mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. \n However, if a person develops an EBV infection during early adulthood, they can develop glandular fever. \n Once you have had glandular fever, it is unlikely you will develop it again. This is because people develop lifelong immunity after the initial infection. \n How glandular fever is diagnosed \n To\u00a0diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask\u00a0about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen. \n Your GP may also recommend a\u00a0 blood test  to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out infections that can cause similar symptoms, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, mumps\u00a0and toxoplasmosis. \n How glandular fever is treated \n There is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to\u00a0control the infection. \n These include: \n \n drinking plenty of fluids \n taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as  paracetamol \u00a0or\u00a0 ibuprofen  \n getting plenty of rest and\u00a0gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve \n \n Occasionally,\u00a0 antibiotics  or\u00a0 corticosteroids  may be used if you develop complications of glandular fever. \n Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating glandular fever . \n Possible complications \n Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include: \n \n further infections of other areas of the body, including the brain, liver\u00a0and lungs \n severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) \n breathing difficulties as a result of the tonsils becoming\u00a0significantly swollen \n a ruptured (burst) spleen, which may need to be treated with surgery \n \n Read more about the\u00a0 complications of glandular fever .", "symptoms": "Symptoms of glandular fever are thought to take around one to two months to develop after infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). \n Main symptoms \n The\u00a0most common\u00a0symptoms of the condition are: \n \n a high temperature (fever) \n a\u00a0 sore throat \u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is usually more painful than any you may have had before \n  swollen glands  in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n \n Other symptoms \n Glandular fever can also cause: \n \n a general sense of feeling unwell \n aching muscles \n chills \n sweats \n loss of appetite \n pain around or behind your eyes \n swollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing \n the inside of your throat to become very red and ooze fluid \n small red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth \n a rash \n swelling or \"puffiness\" around your eyes \n a tender or swollen tummy \n jaundice\u00a0(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) \n \n Some of these symptoms may develop a few days before the main symptoms\u00a0mentioned above. \n How the condition progresses \n Most symptoms of glandular fever will\u00a0usually resolve within two or three weeks.\u00a0Your throat will normally feel most\u00a0sore\u00a0for three to five days after symptoms start before gradually improving, and your fever will usually last 10 to 14 days. \n Fatigue is the most persistent symptom and\u00a0often lasts a few weeks, although some people may feel persistently fatigued for several months after the other symptoms have passed. \n When to seek medical advice \n You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. \n While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment other than provide advice and support,  blood tests \u00a0may be needed to rule out less common but more serious causes of your symptoms, such as hepatitis\u00a0(a viral infection that affects the liver). \n You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department\u00a0or dial 999 for an ambulance\u00a0if you have glandular fever and you: \n \n develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties \n find swallowing fluids difficult \n develop\u00a0intense abdominal pain \n \n If you have these symptoms, you may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days. \n Read more about  treating glandular fever .", "causes": "Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

These are known as asymptomatic carriers. \n Some people can have the virus in their saliva for a few months after recovering from glandular fever, and may continue to have the virus in their saliva on and off for years. \n This is because the virus remains inactive in the body for the rest of your life after you have been exposed to it. For most people, the inactive virus won't cause any symptoms. \n However, there is a chance of the virus periodically becoming reactivated, which may mean it re-enters the saliva. This reactivation may be without any symptoms, or it\u00a0may cause symptoms to recur for a short time.", "treatment": "There is currently no cure for glandular fever, but the symptoms should pass within a few weeks. There are things you can do to help control your symptoms. \n Fluids \n It is important to drink plenty of fluids\u00a0(preferably water or unsweetened fruit juice) to avoid  dehydration . \n Avoid alcohol, as this could\u00a0harm your liver, which may already be weakened from the infection. \n Painkillers \n Painkillers available over the counter, such as  paracetamol  or\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u00a0such as  ibuprofen , can help reduce pain and fever. \n Children under 16 years old should not take aspirin because there is a small risk\u00a0it could trigger a rare but serious health condition called\u00a0Reye's syndrome. \n Regularly gargling with a solution of warm, salty water may also help relieve your\u00a0 sore throat . \n Rest \n It is important\u00a0you take plenty of rest while you recover from glandular fever, although complete bed rest is no longer recommended because it\u00a0may make the fatigue last longer. \n You should gradually increase your activities as your energy levels return, but avoid activities you cannot manage comfortably. \n For the first month after your symptoms begin, avoid contact sports or activities that put you at risk of falling. This is because you may have a swollen spleen that\u00a0it is more vulnerable to damage, and a sudden knock could cause it to burst (rupture). \n Preventing the spread of infection \n There is no need to be isolated from others if you have glandular fever\u00a0as most people will already be immune to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). \n You can return to work, college or school as soon as you feel well enough. There is little risk of spreading the infection to others as long as you follow commonsense precautions while you are ill, such as not kissing other people or sharing utensils. \n It is also important to\u00a0thoroughly clean anything that may have been contaminated by saliva until you have recovered. \n Antibiotics and steroids \n  Antibiotics \u00a0are not effective in treating glandular fever because they have no effect on viruses,\u00a0but they\u00a0may be prescribed if you also develop a bacterial infection of\u00a0your throat or lungs  (pneumonia) . \n A short course of\u00a0 corticosteroids  may also be helpful if: \n \n your tonsils are particularly swollen\u00a0and\u00a0are causing breathing difficulties \n you have severe anaemia (a lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells) \n you have\u00a0problems affecting your heart, such as pericarditis (inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart) \n you have\u00a0problems affecting your brain or nerves, such as encephalitis \n \n Read more about\u00a0the  complications of glandular fever . \n Hospital treatment \n Most people are able to recover from glandular fever\u00a0at home, but hospital treatment may be necessary for a few days if you or your child: \n \n develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties \n find swallowing fluids difficult \n develop intense abdominal pain \n \n Treatment in hospital may involve receiving fluids or antibiotics directly into a vein (intravenously), corticosteroid injections and pain relief. \n In\u00a0a small number of\u00a0cases, emergency surgery to remove\u00a0the spleen (splenectomy) may be needed if it ruptures.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

After this time the pain should pass and the joint\u00a0should return to normal. \n Almost everyone with gout will experience further attacks at some point, usually within a year. \n Read more about the  symptoms of gout . \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn't been previously diagnosed, particularly if the pain keeps getting worse and you also have a high temperature (fever). \n It's important that a diagnosis is confirmed because other conditions that require urgent treatment, such as an infected joint, can sometimes cause similar symptoms. \n If you've already been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if any medication you've been prescribed (see below) doesn't start working within a couple of days. \n Read more about  diagnosing gout . \n What causes gout? \n Gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood. \n If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don't filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful. \n Things that may increase your chances of getting gout include: \n \n  obesity ,  high blood pressure \u00a0and/or\u00a0 diabetes  \n having a close relative with gout \n kidney problems \n eating foods that cause\u00a0a build-up of uric acid, such as red meat, offal and seafood \n drinking too much beer\u00a0or spirits \n \n Read more about the  causes of gout . \n Treatments for gout \n If you have gout, treatment is available from your GP to: \n \n relieve symptoms\u00a0during an attack \u2013\u00a0this can be done using ice packs and by taking medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine or\u00a0 corticosteroids  \n prevent\u00a0further attacks \u2013 through a combination of\u00a0lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or changing your diet, and taking medication\u00a0that lowers uric acid\u00a0levels, such as\u00a0allopurinol\u00a0 \n \n With treatment, many people are able to reduce their uric acid levels sufficiently to dissolve the crystals that cause gout \u2013 and as a result have no further attacks. However, lifelong treatment is usually required. \n Read more about  treating gout . \n Can gout cause further problems? \n Sometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it's left untreated. \n These can include: \n \n  kidney stones  \n small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi \n permanent joint damage \n \n Read more about the  complications of gout . \n What's pseudogout? \n Pseudogout is\u00a0a similar condition to gout,\u00a0but usually\u00a0affects the knee joint first. It's a form of arthritis that causes pain, stiffness, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in one or more of your joints - commonly the knee or wrist.", "symptoms": "The main symptom of gout is a sudden attack of severe pain in one or more joints, typically your big toe. \n Other symptoms can include: \n \n the joint feeling hot and very tender, to the point of\u00a0being unable to bear anything touching it \n swelling in and around the affected joint \n red, shiny skin over the affected joint \n peeling, itchy and flaky skin as the swelling goes down \n \n The intense pain can make getting around difficult. Even the light pressure of a bed cover or blanket can be unbearable. \n Which joints\u00a0can be\u00a0affected? \n Gout can affect almost any joint and can occur in more than one joint at the same time. \n The joints towards the ends of the limbs tend to be affected more often, including the: \n \n toes\u00a0\u2013 particularly the big toe joint \n midfoot (where your shoelaces sit) \n ankles\u00a0 \n knees \n fingers \n wrists \n elbows \n \n If gout is left untreated, it's\u00a0likely to affect more joints over time. \n Pattern of symptoms \n Attacks\u00a0of gout tend to: \n \n occur at night, although they can\u00a0happen at any time \n develop\u00a0quickly over a few hours \n last between three and 10 days \u2013 after this time, the affected joint should start to return to normal, but the problem can persist if treatment isn't started early \n come back\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may\u00a0experience attacks every few months or years \n become more frequent over time if not treated \n \n It's difficult to predict how often attacks will occur and when exactly they will happen. \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn't been previously diagnosed. \n Contact your GP immediately or call the NHS 24 '111' service\u00a0if you have both: \n \n severe, worsening joint pain and swelling \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n \n This could mean you have an infection inside the joint (septic arthritis). \n If you've already\u00a0been diagnosed with gout and you have an attack, see your GP if\u00a0any medication you've been prescribed doesn't start working within a couple of\u00a0days. \n Read more about  diagnosing gout \u00a0and  treating gout .", "causes": "Gout is caused by small crystals forming in the joints, resulting in severe pain, tenderness and swelling. \n These crystals can grow when a waste product called uric acid starts to build up to high levels in\u00a0the body. \n Uric acid \n Uric acid is created when the body breaks down chemicals known as purines. \n If your kidneys don't filter out enough uric acid, or your body is producing unusually high levels of it, it can build up in the body and turn into microscopic crystals. \n These crystals usually form in and around the joints, possibly because the temperature in these areas is slightly lower than the rest of the body. If they get into the space between joints, the crystals can cause painful inflammation (redness and swelling). \n What can increase your risk? \n A high level of uric acid in the blood is the main factor that increases your risk of developing gout. However, it's still uncertain why some people with a high level of uric acid in the blood develop gout, while others with an equally high level don't. \n Other factors that may increase your risk of developing gout are outlined below. \n Medical conditions \n Some underlying medical conditions can increase your risk of developing gout, including: \n \n  high blood pressure  \n  diabetes  \n  kidney disease    \n  high levels of fat and cholesterol  in your blood \n  obesity  \n metabolic syndrome\u00a0(a\u00a0combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity) \n  psoriasis  (a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales) \n  osteoarthritis  \n \n Medication \n Certain medications can increase your uric acid levels and your risk of developing gout. These include: \n \n diuretics (water tablets)\u00a0\u2013 used to treat high blood pressure or an abnormal build-up of fluid in your body \n certain\u00a0medicines used to treat high blood pressure\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including  beta-blockers  and ACE inhibitors \n  low-dose aspirin \u00a0\u2013 used to reduce the risk of\u00a0 blood clots  \n niacin\u00a0\u2013\u00a0used to treat high cholesterol \n ciclosporin\u00a0\u2013 used to treat conditions such as\u00a0psoriasis \n some\u00a0 chemotherapy  medicines \n \n Diet \n Uric acid is created when the body breaks down purines. Eating foods that contain a high level of purines can increase your risk of gout. \n Foods naturally high in purines include: \n \n red meat\u00a0\u2013 such as beef, lamb and pork\u00a0 \n seafood\u00a0\u2013 especially shellfish and oily fish \n offal\u00a0\u2013 such as liver, kidneys and heart \n \n Alcohol \n Alcoholic drinks can raise the level of uric acid in the blood. \n Beer, fortified wines like port, and spirits do this more than wine. Moderate consumption of wine \u2013 one or two glasses a day \u2013 shouldn't significantly increase your risk of gout. \n Sugary drinks \n Certain sugary drinks may also increase your risk of gout. \n Some research has\u00a0found that drinking sugar-sweetened soft drinks and drinks with high levels of fructose (a naturally occurring sugar found in many\u00a0fruits)\u00a0had an\u00a0increased risk of gout. \n Family history \n Studies have shown that gout often runs in families. Around\u00a0one in five people with gout have a close family member with the condition.", "treatment": "Treatment for gout includes pain relief to help you cope with a gout attack, as well as medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks. \n Pain relief for a gout attack \n What to do during an attack \n You should: \n \n take any medication you've been prescribed as early as possible after you notice an attack (see below) \u2013 this should start to have an effect within two or three days \n rest and raise the limb \n avoid knocking or damaging the affected joint \n keep the joint cool \u2013 remove surrounding clothing and apply an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel \n ensure you're well hydrated \n \n Apply the ice pack to your joint for around 20 minutes. Don't apply ice directly to your skin and don't apply it for more than 20 minutes at a time because this could damage the skin. \n If necessary, you can keep reapplying an ice pack to your skin during an attack, but you should wait until your skin has returned to a normal temperature first. \n NSAIDs \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  are usually recommended as the first\u00a0treatment for gout. They work by reducing pain and inflammation during an attack. \n NSAIDs used to treat gout include naproxen, diclofenac and etoricoxib. \n If you've been prescribed NSAIDs, it's a good idea\u00a0to have them with you at all times so you can use them at the first sign of a gout attack. Continue to take your medication throughout the attack and for 48 hours afterwards. \n Your GP may also prescribe a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), to take alongside your NSAID. This\u00a0reduces the risk of the NSAID causing  indigestion ,\u00a0 stomach ulcers  and bleeding from the stomach. \n Colchicine \n If you're unable to take NSAIDs or if NSAIDs are ineffective, a medicine called\u00a0colchicine can be used instead. \n Colchicine reduces some of the swelling and pain associated with a gout attack. \n It's best to have it with you at all times so you can use it at the first sign of a gout attack. Your GP will tell you how long to take it for and how often. \n When taken in high doses, side effects of colchicine include feeling sick, abdominal (tummy) pain and  diarrhoea . \n Corticosteroids \n  Corticosteroids \u00a0are sometimes used to treat severe cases of gout if other treatments don't work or you're unable to take an NSAID or colchicine. \n A short course of steroid tablets often provides relief, but they can't be used long-term in high doses as they cause side effects, including:\u00a0 \n \n weight gain \n thinning of the bones ( osteoporosis ) \n easy bruising \n muscle weakness \n \n Corticosteroids can also be given by injection to provide rapid pain relief. This can be either into a muscle, a vein or directly into the affected joint.\u00a0 \n Medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further attacks \n You can reduce your chances of having further gout attacks by taking medication and making lifestyle changes to\u00a0reduce the level of\u00a0uric acid in your body. \n Medication \n Medication to reduce uric acid levels\u00a0\u2013 known as urate-lowering therapy (ULT)\u00a0\u2013 is usually recommended if you have recurrent attacks of gout or you have   complications of gout . \n Most people with gout will eventually need to have ULT, so you may want to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this treatment with your doctor as soon as you've been diagnosed with gout. \n They should explain that while ULT can significantly reduce your risk of having further attacks, the medication needs to be taken on a daily basis for the rest of your life and there's a small risk of side effects. \n If you decide to start ULT, a medicine called allopurinol is usually tried first. If this isn't suitable or doesn't work, other medications may be used instead. These medications are described below. \n Allopurinol \n Allopurinol\u00a0helps reduce the production of uric acid. It can help prevent gout attacks, although it won't help relieve symptoms during an attack. \n Allopurinol is a tablet\u00a0taken once a day.\u00a0When you first start taking it, your dose will be adjusted to make sure the level of uric acid in your blood is low enough. Regular\u00a0 blood tests  will be needed to monitor this until the\u00a0most effective dose is found. \n Allopurinol can sometimes cause a gout attack soon after you start taking it and it\u00a0can take up to a year or two before no further attacks occur. It's important to persevere with treatment even if you do have attacks during this time. \n To help\u00a0relieve attacks, your doctor will prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described above to take alongside your allopurinol at first. \n Most people taking allopurinol won't experience any significant side effects. However, side effects can include: \n \n a rash \u2013 this is usually mild and goes away on its own, but it can be a sign of an\u00a0allergy; if you develop a rash, stop taking the medication immediately and contact your GP for advice \n  indigestion  \n  headaches  \n diarrhoea \n \n Febuxostat \n Like allopurinol, febuxostat\u00a0is a medication taken once a day that\u00a0reduces the body's production of uric acid. It's often used if allopurinol isn't suitable or causes troublesome side effects. \n As with allopurinol, febuxostat can make your symptoms worse when you first start taking it. Your doctor will initially prescribe one of the pain relieving medications described in case you experience attacks. \n Side effects of febuxostat can include: \n \n diarrhoea \n feeling sick \n headaches \n a\u00a0rash \n \n Other\u00a0medications \n Less commonly used ULT medications include benzbromarone and sulfinpyrazone. \n These types of medication tend to only be used if people are unable to take allopurinol or febuxostat. They need to be prescribed under the supervision of a specialist. \n Lifestyle changes \n Certain lifestyle changes can also help reduce your risk of experiencing further attacks of gout, including: \n \n avoiding foods containing high levels of purine (the chemical involved in the production of uric acid), such as red meat, offal, oily fish, seafood and foods containing yeast extract\u00a0\u2013 see the  gout and diet leaflet (PDF, 1Mb)  produced by the UK Gout Society \n avoiding sugary drinks and snacks \u2013 these are associated with an increased risk of gout \n maintaining a healthy weight \u2013\u00a0follow a  balanced diet ; don't crash diet or try\u00a0high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets \n taking regular exercise \u2013 try activities that don't put too much strain on your joints, such as swimming \n drinking plenty of water \u2013\u00a0keeping yourself well hydrated will reduce the risk of crystals forming in your joints \n cutting down on alcohol \u2013 avoid beer and spirits in particular and don't binge drink \n \n There's some evidence to suggest that taking regular\u00a0 vitamin C  supplements can reduce gout attacks, although the effect\u00a0may only be small. Talk to your GP first if you're thinking about taking vitamin C supplements, as they aren't suitable or safe for everyone.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP may suspect gout based on your symptoms. Sometimes further tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes. \n Seeing your GP \n See your GP if you experience\u00a0 symptoms of gout  for the first time. \n Your GP will\u00a0ask about\u00a0your symptoms and\u00a0medical history, and examine the affected area, to help make a diagnosis. \n They\u00a0may also ask you about your diet, particularly your intake of beer, spirits and foods high in purines, such as red meat and seafood. \n Further tests \n Many conditions can cause gout-like symptoms. \n Your GP may be unable to make a firm diagnosis straight away and you may be referred for further tests. These will either confirm the diagnosis of gout or rule out other conditions. \n Joint fluid test \n A sample of fluid may be taken from the affected joint.\u00a0The fluid can be checked for the small crystals that cause gout,\u00a0and it can be tested for infection to rule out septic arthritis. \n Blood test \n A  blood test  known as a\u00a0serum uric acid test\u00a0may be used to measure the amount of uric acid in your blood. A high level or uric acid is often associated with gout. \n It\u2019s sometimes best to wait until two to four weeks after an attack of gout before this test is carried out, as the level of uric acid in your blood is often not raised at the time of an attack. This is because the level of uric acid in your blood can drop when uric acid crystals form in the joints. \n X-ray \n An\u00a0 X-ray  is rarely used to diagnose gout because the condition isn't usually detectable using this method. \n However, an X-ray is sometimes used to help rule out similar conditions that affect the joints, such as chondrocalcinosis (a build-up of calcium crystals in the joints) or to assess whether there has been any joint damage due to repeated or persistent attacks of gout. \n Ultrasound scan \n An\u00a0 ultrasound scan  of an affected joint is a simple and safe investigation that's increasingly used to detect crystals in the joints. It can also detect crystals\u00a0deep\u00a0in the skin that aren't obvious during a physical examination."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Germ cell tumours", "introduction": "Each year, fewer than 45 children in the UK develop malignant germ cell tumours. Most children who develop germ cell tumours will be cured. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions, it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Germ cell tumours \n Germ cell tumours can appear at any age. They develop from cells that produce eggs or sperm so germ cell tumours can affect the ovaries or testes. However, it is possible for a germ cell tumour to develop in other parts of the body. \n As a baby develops during pregnancy, the cells producing eggs or sperm normally move to the ovaries or testes. However, occasionally they can settle in other parts of the body where they can develop into tumours. The most common places for this to happen are the bottom of the spine (sacrococcygeal), the brain, chest, and abdomen. \n Germ cell tumours are sometimes given different names based on their characteristics. These include yolk-sac tumours, germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, mature teratomas and immature teratomas. \n They may be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Malignant tumours have the ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body. \n Benign tumours do not spread but may cause problems by pressing on nearby tissue and organs. \n Immature teratomas fall between benign and malignant. They can spread within the abdomen but not beyond, and can be removed with an operation. \n Causes \n The cause of germ cell tumours is unknown but research into the causes of different cancers is on-going. \n Signs and symptoms \n The symptoms depend on where the tumour develops. Usually it starts with a lump that can either be felt or causes other symptoms. \n How germ cell tumours are diagnosed \n Different tests may be needed to diagnose a germ cell tumour. Usually, the doctor will remove a sample of tissue from the lump (a  biopsy ) for examination under a microscope to find out if it is a cancer or not. \n A  CT  or  MRI scan  may be used to see the exact position of a tumour within the body. Chest X-rays may be taken to see if there\u2019s a tumour in the lungs. \n Germ cell tumours often produce proteins called tumour markers that can be measured in the blood. The ones that are produced by germ cell tumours are alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). Your child will have blood tests to check these tumour markers when they are being diagnosed. The doctors will continue to check these during treatment and after treatment is over. \n Sometimes a germ cell tumour can be diagnosed with tumour marker and scan results so that a biopsy isn\u2019t necessary. This is particularly so if surgery is not needed for treatment, for example if the tumour is in the brain. \n Staging \n The stage of a cancer describes its size and whether it has spread from where it started. Knowing the stage helps doctors to decide on the most appropriate treatment. \n Generally cancer is divided into four stages: \n  Stage 1  \n The cancer is small, has not spread and has been completely removed. \n  Stages 2 and 3  \n The cancer is larger and may not have been completely removed, or may have spread to nearby organs. \n  Stage 4  \n The cancer has spread to other parts of the body. \n Cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body and formed new tumours is known as secondary or metastatic cancer. \n Treatment \n The treatment your child will have usually depends on a number of factors, including the size, position and stage of the tumour. It usually includes either surgery or chemotherapy, or a combination of the two. \n A benign tumour can be cured if it is removed by surgery. It may mean removing a testicle or an ovary if this is where the tumour started. \n If the tumour is malignant and can be completely removed with surgery,  chemotherapy  is not always needed, especially if it began in the testis or ovary. If the tumour cannot be removed easily or has spread, your child will be given chemotherapy. \n Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. Germ cell tumours are very sensitive to chemotherapy. It\u2019s usually given as injections and drips (infusions) into a vein. \n A combination of drugs is usually given every three weeks for three or five months. The length of time chemotherapy is given for depends on the position of the tumour, the level of AFP, and whether or not the tumour has spread. \n Treatment of malignant germ cell tumours in the brain is a little different. Although they are very sensitive to chemotherapy, treatment with radiotherapy is also needed.  Radiotherapy  is the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. Unlike germ cell tumours elsewhere in the body, it\u2019s not always necessary to remove germ cell tumours in the brain with surgery. \n Side effects of treatment \n Treatment often causes side effects, and your child\u2019s doctor will discuss these with you before treatment starts. The operation your child has will be individually planned to try to reduce any possible problems. The surgeon and specialist nurse will discuss this with you. \n The side effects of chemotherapy usually gradually improve when treatment is over and many of them can be well controlled. \n The side effects of treatment depend on the drugs used but can include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n  hair loss  \n increased risk of infection \n bruising and bleeding \n  tiredness  \n diarrhoea \n \n Late side effects \n A small number of children may develop long-term side effects of treatment, sometimes many years later. These are not common but may include problems with how the kidneys or lungs work and some hearing loss. Your child\u2019s specialist doctor or nurse will tell you more about any possible late side effects. \n If your child has only one ovary or testis removed, they\u2019ll usually still be able to have children in the future. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancers. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Your child will continue to have regular blood tests during and after treatment, to check their levels of AFP and HCG. If the levels rise, this indicates that the tumour might have come back and further treatment is needed. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Genital warts", "introduction": "Genital warts are small fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes that appear on or around the genital or anal area. \n Genital warts are very common. In England, they are the second most common type of  sexually transmitted infection (STI)  after chlamydia. \n Genital warts are the result of a viral skin infection\u00a0caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). They\u00a0are usually painless and do not pose a serious threat to health. \n But they can\u00a0be unpleasant to look at\u00a0and cause psychological distress. \n There is no evidence that your fertility will be affected by genital warts. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of genital warts  \n The human papilloma virus (HPV) \n The HPV is not a single virus, but a family of\u00a0more than\u00a0100 different strains of viruses.\u00a0Different strains usually affect different parts of the body, including the hands or feet. \n Although around 30 different types of HPV can affect the genital skin, most cases of infection with HPV cause no visible symptoms. Around 90% of\u00a0all cases of genital warts are caused by two strains of the virus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0type 6 and type 11. \n The types of HPV that cause visible genital warts do not cause genital cancer. Other strains of HPV can cause  cervical cancer . \n How do they spread? \n Genital warts can be spread during vaginal or anal sex, and by sharing sex toys.\u00a0But you don't need to have penetrative sex to pass the infection on because HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact. \n Read more about the  causes of genital warts  \n It can take months, or even years, for warts to develop after infection with HPV. So if you're in a relationship and you get genital warts, it does not necessarily mean your partner has been having sex with other people. \n HPV is most likely to be transmitted to others when warts are present, although it is still possible to pass the virus on before the warts have developed and after they have disappeared. \n Condoms do not provide complete protection because it is possible for the skin around your genital area not covered by the condom to become infected. \n Read more about\u00a0 preventing genital warts  \n Treating genital warts \n If you think you have genital warts, see a health professional as they may need to be treated. It is possible to have more than one STI at a time, so if you think you have warts, it is a good idea to have a check-up. \n You can make an appointment at your local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. \n You can go to a sexual health clinic whatever age you are. If you're under 16, the service is still confidential and the clinic won't tell your parents. \n Find your\u00a0 local sexual health or GUM clinic  \n The treatment for genital warts depends on how many warts you have and where they are. Several treatments are available, such as liquids or\u00a0creams and freezing the warts (cryotherapy). \n You should not use wart creams that are available over the counter because they are designed to only treat warts on the hands or verrucas. \n If you are diagnosed with genital warts, it\u00a0is recommended you do not have sex, including anal and oral sex, until your genital warts have fully healed. This will help prevent you passing the infection on to others. It will also help speed up your recovery. \n Learn more in  treating genital warts  \n Will the warts come back? \n Some people only ever get one episode of genital warts. For many others, the warts will come back weeks, months or years later. \n If you do develop a new wart, it is not possible to say if these are\u00a0a result of\u00a0the original infection or a new infection with HPV.", "symptoms": "Most people who have an HPV infection will not develop any visible warts. If genital warts do appear, it can be several weeks, months or even years after you first came into contact with the virus. \n The warts may appear as small, fleshy growths, bumps or skin changes anywhere on the genitals or around the anus. In some cases, the warts are so small\u00a0they are\u00a0difficult to notice. \n A person can have a single wart or clusters of multiple warts that grow together to form a kind of \"cauliflower\" appearance. \n Warts in women \n The most common places for genital warts to develop in women are: \n \n around the vulva (the opening of the vagina) \n on the cervix (the neck of the womb) \n inside the vagina \n around or inside the anus \n on the upper thighs \n \n Warts in men \n The most common places for genital warts to develop in men are: \n \n anywhere on the penis \n on the scrotum \n inside the urethra (tube where urine comes out) \n around or inside the anus \n on the upper thighs \n \n Other symptoms \n Warts are usually painless, although on some people they can become itchy and inflamed. If a wart becomes inflamed, it may lead to bleeding from the urethra, vagina or anus. \n The urethra is the tube connected to the bladder, which urine passes through.\u00a0Warts that develop near or inside the urethra can also disrupt the normal flow of urine. \n See\u00a0 treatment of genital warts  for more information \n When to seek medical advice \n You should always seek medical advice if you suspect you have genital warts, or a recent or current sexual partner develops genital warts. \n Even if no warts have developed, you can be given advice on how to check yourself and what to do if they appear.\u00a0 \n Treatments are only available with a prescription and may need to be applied by a nurse or doctor. It is also important to get a proper diagnosis in case the growth is not a genital wart. \n If you do need a prescription treatment for warts, these are free from sexual health and genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics.\u00a0It is recommended you avoid having sex until your genital warts are fully healed. \n Find  sexual health services near you , including sexual health and GUM clinics \n Read more information about  diagnosing genital warts", "causes": "Genital warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). \n HPV is not a single virus, but a family of\u00a0more than\u00a0100 different strains of viruses.\u00a0However, most\u00a0cases of genital warts are caused by two strains of the virus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0type 6 and type 11. \n Most cases of HPV infection\u00a0do not have visible symptoms, so many people can be infected with HPV without realising. \n It is still possible to pass on genital warts if they are not currently visible. \n HPV transmission \n The most common way HPV can be passed from person to person is through skin to skin contact. This is usually sexual activity such as: \n \n vaginal sex \n anal sex \n non-penetrative genital to genital contact \n sharing sex toys \n in very rare cases,\u00a0oral sex \n \n HPV is not passed on through kissing, hugging or sharing towels, clothing and everyday\u00a0items such as cutlery or a toilet seat. \n A\u00a0 condom  can help protect against genital warts. However, as it does not cover all of the genital area, it may still be possible to pass HPV on to uncovered areas of skin. \n In rare cases, a mother can pass HPV on to her newborn baby during birth. \n In very rare\u00a0cases, someone with\u00a0HPV warts on their hands could pass on an infection\u00a0by touching somebody else's genitals.", "treatment": "Treatment for genital warts depends on the type of warts you have and where they are located. You do not need treatment if there are no visible warts. \n There are two main types of treatment for genital warts: \n \n applying a cream, lotion or chemical to the warts (topical treatment) \n destroying the tissue of the warts by freezing, heating or removing them (physical ablation) \n \n Most\u00a0topical treatments tend to work better on softer warts, and physical ablation tends to work better on harder and rougher-feeling warts. Sometimes, a combination of topical treatments is recommended. \n For some people, treatment can take several months to remove the warts, so it is important to persevere. \n You may be advised to avoid perfumed soap, bath bubbles or lotions while you are having treatment for warts as these can sometimes irritate the skin. \n Topical treatment \n There are\u00a0several topical treatments that can be used to treat genital warts. Some creams can weaken latex condoms, diaphragms and caps. Remember to check this with the doctor or nurse, who can advise you. \n Topical treatments\u00a0are described below. \n Podophyllotoxin \n Podophyllotoxin\u00a0is usually recommended to treat clusters of small warts. It comes in liquid form and works by having a toxic (poisonous) effect on the cells of the warts. \n A special application stick is used to draw up the correct dosage of the liquid, which is then dripped on to the wart. \n You may experience some mild irritation when you apply the liquid or cream to the wart. Cream is usually advised for areas where applying liquid is difficult. \n Treatment with podophyllotoxin is based on cycles. The first treatment cycle involves applying the medication twice a day for three days. \n This is then followed by a rest cycle where you have four days without treatment. Most people require four to five treatment cycles separated by rest cycles. \n Podophyllotoxin should not be used if you are pregnant. \n Imiquimod \n Imiquimod\u00a0is a type of cream usually recommended to treat larger warts. \n It works by helping stimulate your immune system into attacking the warts. You apply the cream to the warts and then wash it off after\u00a06 to\u00a010 hours. This should be done three times a week. \n You may experience skin irritation after you apply the cream. Usually this is mild, but contact the doctor or clinic if it does not improve. \n It can often take several weeks of treatment before you notice an improvement in your warts. \n Imiquimod is not usually used if you are pregnant. \n Trichloroacetic acid \n Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) may be recommended to treat small warts that are very hard.\u00a0 \n It works by destroying the proteins inside the cells of the wart. But if it is not applied correctly, TCA can damage healthy skin. \n TCA is thought to be safe to use during pregnancy. \n It is not recommended that you apply TCA yourself. Instead, you will be asked to visit your local GUM clinic once a week so\u00a0a doctor or nurse can apply the medication. \n After TCA is applied, some people experience an intense burning sensation for around 5 to 10 minutes. \n Physical ablation \n There are four main methods used in the physical ablation of genital warts. They are: \n \n cryotherapy \n excision \n electrosurgery \n laser surgery \n \n These treatments are performed by a trained doctor or nurse. \n Cryotherapy \n Cryotherapy\u00a0involves freezing the wart using liquid nitrogen and\u00a0is usually recommended to treat multiple small warts, particularly those that develop on the shaft of the penis or on, or near, the vulva. \n During cryotherapy treatment, you will experience a mild to moderate burning sensation. \n Once the treatment has finished you may develop skin irritation, blistering and pain at the site of the wart. Your skin will take between one\u00a0and three weeks to heal. \n Avoid having sex until the area of skin around the wart has fully healed. \n Excision \n Excision,\u00a0where\u00a0warts are cut away,\u00a0is sometimes recommended to treat small hardened warts, particularly where this is a combination of smaller warts that have joined together to form a sort of cauliflower shape. \n At the start of the procedure, you will be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area of skin around the wart. The wart will then be cut away with a surgical scalpel and the remaining incision sealed with stitches. \n Excision can cause scarring, so it may not be suitable for very large warts. The area of skin where the wart was removed will be sore and tender for around one to three weeks. \n You should avoid having sex until the area of skin around the wart has fully healed. \n Electrosurgery \n Electrosurgery is a specialist treatment. It is often combined with excision to treat large warts that develop around the anus or vulva that have failed to respond to topical treatments. \n Excision is first\u00a0used to remove the outer bulk of the wart. A metal loop is then pressed against the wart. An electric current is passed through the loop to burn away the remaining part of the wart. \n Removing a large number of warts in this way can be quite painful, so you may be given a regional anaesthetic (where everything below your spine is numbed, similar to an epidural during pregnancy) or even a general anaesthetic. \n Laser surgery \n Laser surgery is also a\u00a0specialist treatment.\u00a0It may be recommended to treat large genital warts that cannot be treated using other methods of physical ablation because they are difficult\u00a0to access, such as warts deep inside your anus or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the penis or vulva, which urine passes through). \n During the procedure,\u00a0a surgeon will use a laser to burn away the warts. Depending on the number and size of the warts, laser surgery can be performed under either a local or general anaesthetic. \n As with other types of ablation treatment, you should expect soreness and irritation at the site where the warts were removed. This should heal within two to four weeks.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you think you may have genital warts, visit your local sexual health or genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. \n Your GP will be able to diagnose genital warts and provide certain treatments, but the nurses and doctors at\u00a0your local clinic will have access to a wider variety of treatments. \n Staff at the clinic will have specialist training to help diagnose, treat and support you. There is no blood test to check for an active HPV infection. \n Find your  local sexual health or GUM clinic  \n Who should go for a check-up? \n You should have a check-up if you have obvious signs and symptoms of genital warts, or if a recent or current sexual partner develops genital warts or any other type of\u00a0 sexually transmitted infection (STI) . \n You may also wish to have a check-up if: \n \n you have recently had unprotected sex with a new partner \n you or your partner have had unprotected sex with other partners \n you have another STI \n you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy \n \n All check-ups in sexual health and GUM clinics are free and confidential. \n Diagnosing genital warts \n Genital warts can usually be easily diagnosed\u00a0with a simple examination. At a check-up, the doctor or nurse will examine the warts. They may use a magnifying lens to do this. \n You may also be advised to have other areas of your genital skin examined\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, inside the vagina or around your anus. \n Further testing \n Depending on where your warts are, you may be advised to have a more detailed examination. If you are advised to have a vaginal examination, this will usually be performed with a small plastic or metal tube called a vaginal speculum. \n This will allow the doctor or nurse to see inside the vagina. It is a simple examination and is not usually painful. \n If you are advised to have an examination of the inside of your anus, this will usually be performed using a small plastic tube called a proctoscope. This will allow the doctor or nurse to see the skin inside the anus. It is not usually painful. \n If you are experiencing problems with the flow of urine, you may be advised to have a special examination of the urethra (the tube that urine flows through). This is usually only performed by a specialist."},

The main types are: \n \n antacids\u00a0\u2013 these\u00a0neutralise the effects of stomach acid \n alginates \u2013\u00a0these\u00a0produce a coating that protects the stomach and oesophagus (gullet) from stomach acid \n low-dose proton-pump inhibitors and\u00a0H2-receptor antagonists \u2013\u00a0see below for more information about these\u00a0 \n \n These medicines aren't suitable for everyone, so you should check the leaflet first. Ask a pharmacist for advice if you're not sure. \n Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) \n If your symptoms don't get better despite trying self-help measures and over-the-counter medicines, your GP may prescribe a PPI. These work by reducing the amount of acid\u00a0produced by your stomach. \n You'll usually be given enough medication to last a month. Go back to your GP if they don't\u00a0help or your symptoms return after treatment finishes.\u00a0Some people need to take\u00a0PPIs on a long-term basis. \n The possible side effects of PPIs are usually mild. They include headaches,  diarrhoea \u00a0or\u00a0 constipation , feeling sick,  abdominal (tummy) pain , dizziness\u00a0and a rash. \n Your GP will prescribe the lowest dose that they think will control your symptoms to reduce the risk of side effects. \n H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) \n If PPIs don't control your symptoms, a medicine known as a H2RA may be recommended for you to take alongside them on a short-term basis, or as an alternative. \n Like PPIs, H2RAs reduce the amount of acid produced by\u00a0your stomach. \n Side effects of H2RAs are uncommon, but can\u00a0include diarrhoea, headaches, dizziness, a\u00a0rash and tiredness. \n Surgery and procedures \n Surgery may be an option if: \n \n the above treatments don't help,\u00a0aren't suitable for you, or\u00a0cause troublesome side effects \n you don't want to take medication on a long-term basis \n \n The main procedure used is called\u00a0a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF).\u00a0Alternative\u00a0techniques have been developed more recently,\u00a0although these aren't yet widely available. \n Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) \n LNF is a type of laparoscopic or \"keyhole\" surgery. This means it's carried out using special surgical instruments inserted through small cuts (incisions) in the skin. \n The procedure is used to tighten the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus,\u00a0which helps to stop acid leaking up from the stomach. It's carried out in hospital under  general anaesthetic . \n Most people need to stay in hospital for 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0days after the procedure. Depending on your job, you may be able to return to work within 3\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks. \n For the first 6\u00a0weeks after surgery, you should only eat soft food, such as mince, mashed potatoes or soup. Some people experience problems with swallowing, belching and bloating after LNF,\u00a0but these should get better with time. \n Newer operations and procedures \n In the last few years, several new techniques for treating GORD have been developed. \n The\u00a0 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  says these procedures appear to be safe, but\u00a0not much\u00a0is known about their long-term effects. \n These techniques include: \n \n  Endoscopic injection of bulking agents \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where special filler is injected into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make\u00a0it narrower. \n  Endoluminal gastroplication \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where folds are sown into the ring of muscles at the bottom of the oesophagus to restrict how far it can open. \n  Endoscopic augmentation with hydrogel implants \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where implants containing\u00a0special\u00a0gel\u00a0are placed\u00a0into the area between the stomach and oesophagus to make it narrower. \n  Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a tiny balloon is passed down to the bottom of\u00a0the oesophagus and electrodes attached to it are used to heat it and make it narrower. \n  Laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band (LINX) \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a ring of magnetic beads are implanted around the lower part of the oesophagus to strengthen it and help keep it closed when not swallowing. \n \n Speak to your surgeon about these techniques for more information.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will often be able to diagnose\u00a0gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) based on your symptoms. \n They may prescribe medication to treat it without needing to carry out any tests.

The procedure is usually carried out while you're awake, but you may be given a sedative to help you relax. \n The camera can show\u00a0if the surface of your oesophagus (gullet) has been damaged by stomach acid, although this doesn't happen to everyone with GORD. \n Barium swallow or barium meal \n A barium swallow, or barium meal, is a test to assess your swallowing ability and look for any blockages or abnormalities in your oesophagus. \n You are first given some barium solution, then some\u00a0 X-rays \u00a0are taken.\u00a0Barium is a harmless substance that shows up clearly on X-rays as it passes through your digestive system. \n You'll be asked not to\u00a0eat anything for a few hours before the procedure. Afterwards, you'll be able to eat and drink normally, although you may need to drink more water to help flush the barium out of your body. \n Manometry \n Manometry is used to assess how well the ring of muscle at the end of your oesophagus is working, by measuring the pressure in your oesophagus. \n This can rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and\u00a0can help determine whether surgery would be suitable. \n During the procedure,\u00a0a small tube will be passed up your nose and then down into your oesophagus. The tube contains pressure sensors that can detect the pressure in the oesophagus. \n 24-hour pH monitoring \n It may be necessary to measure the acidity level (pH) in your oesophagus to confirm a diagnosis of GORD if nothing is found during an endoscopy. \n The acidity level is measured over 24 hours, using a thin tube containing a sensor that's passed up your nose and down your oesophagus. This is usually connected to a recording device worn on your waist. \n You'll be asked to press a button on the recorder every time you become aware of your symptoms and to record your symptoms in a diary. You should eat as you normally would during the test to ensure an accurate result. \n Blood tests \n Sometimes a\u00a0 blood test  may be carried out to check for\u00a0 anaemia , which can be a sign of internal bleeding."},

Both types are highly contagious and can be passed easily from one person to another by direct contact. \n Genital herpes is usually transmitted by having sex\u00a0(vaginal, anal or oral) with an infected person. Even if someone with genital herpes doesn't have any symptoms, it's possible for them to pass the condition on to a sexual partner. \n At least eight out of 10 people who carry the virus are unaware they have been infected because there are often few or no initial symptoms. However, certain triggers can activate the virus, causing an outbreak of genital herpes. \n Read more about the  causes of genital herpes  \n Treating genital herpes \n Although there's no cure for genital herpes, the symptoms can usually be controlled using antiviral medicines. \n However, it's important to\u00a0 prevent the spread of genital herpes  by avoiding sex until symptoms have cleared up and continuing to use a  condom \u00a0afterwards. \n Read more about  how genital herpes is treated  \n Pregnancy \n Genital herpes can cause problems during pregnancy. These complications can be more serious depending on whether you already have genital herpes, or develop it for the first time while pregnant. \n Read more about  complications of genital herpes", "symptoms": "Most people with the herpes simplex virus (HSV) don't experience any symptoms of genital herpes when first infected. As a result, many people don't know they have the condition. \n Symptoms may not appear until months or sometimes years after you're exposed to\u00a0the virus. \n If you experience symptoms when\u00a0first infected, they usually appear four to\u00a0seven days after you have been exposed to the virus. The symptoms are usually more severe first time around than in cases of recurrent infections. \n Primary infection \n The symptoms of\u00a0genital herpes for the first time include: \n \n small\u00a0 blisters  that burst to leave\u00a0red, open sores around your genitals, rectum (back passage), thighs and buttocks \n blisters and ulcers on the cervix (lower part of the womb) in women \n vaginal discharge in women \n pain when you pass urine \n a general feeling of being unwell, with aches, pains and flu-like symptoms \n \n These symptoms may last up to 20 days. However, the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring. \n Recurrent infections \n Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up, the virus remains dormant (inactive) in a nearby nerve. The virus may be reactivated from time to time, travelling back down the nerve to your skin and causing recurrent outbreaks. \n Symptoms of a recurrent outbreak may include: \n \n a tingling, burning or itching sensation around your genitals, and sometimes down your leg, before blisters appear\u00a0 \n painful red blisters that soon burst to leave sores around your genitals, rectum (back passage), thighs and buttocks \n blisters and ulcers on the cervix (lower part of the womb) in women \n \n Recurrent outbreaks are usually shorter and less severe. This is because your body has produced protective antibodies (proteins that fight infection) in reaction to the previous infection. Your body now recognises the virus and mounts a response that is able to fight HSV more effectively. \n Over time, you should find any recurrent genital herpes infections become less frequent and less severe. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of genital herpes", "causes": "Genital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another through skin-to-skin contact, such as during vaginal, anal or oral sex. \n There are two types of HSV: \n \n type 1 (HSV-1) \n type 2 (HSV-2) \n \n Genital herpes is caused by both type 1 and type 2 HSV. \n Whenever HSV is present on the surface of your skin it can be passed on to a partner. The virus passes easily through the moist skin that lines your genitals, mouth and anus (the opening where solid waste leaves the body). \n In some cases it is also possible to become infected by coming into contact with other parts of the body that can be affected by HSV, such as the eyes and skin. For example, you can catch genital herpes if you have oral sex with someone who has a  cold sore . A cold sore is a blister-like lesion around the mouth that is also caused by HSV. \n Genital herpes cannot usually be passed on through objects, such as towels, cutlery or cups because the virus dies very quickly when away from your skin. However, you may become infected by sharing sex toys with someone who has the virus. \n Genital herpes is particularly easy to catch when an infected person has blisters or sores. However, it can be caught at any time, even when someone has no symptoms at all. \n Once you have been infected with HSV, it can be reactivated every so often to cause a new episode of genital herpes. This is known as recurrence. \n Recurrence triggers \n It is not completely understood why HSV is reactivated, but certain triggers may be responsible for the symptoms of genital herpes recurring. \n For example, friction in your genital area during sexual intercourse may cause a recurrence. Using a lubricant can help \u2013 these are available from pharmacies without needing a prescription. \n Other possible triggers include: \n \n being unwell \n  stress  \n drinking excess amounts of alcohol \n exposure to ultraviolet light, for example, using sunbeds \n surgery on your genital area \n having a weakened immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system), for example, as a result of having  chemotherapy  (treatment for cancer)", "treatment": "Treatment for genital herpes will depend on whether you have the infection for the first time (a primary infection) or your symptoms keep coming back (a recurrent outbreak). \n Primary infection \n If you have genital herpes for the first time, see your GP or visit\u00a0your local\u00a0GUM clinic (also called sexual health clinics). They may prescribe antiviral tablets, such as aciclovir, which you will need to take five times a day. \n Aciclovir works by preventing HSV from multiplying. However, it does not clear the virus from your body completely and does not have any effect once you stop taking it. \n You will need to take a course of aciclovir for at least five days, or longer if you still have new blisters and open sores forming on your genital area when your treatment begins. \n Aciclovir can cause some side effects, including being sick and headaches. \n Other antiviral medications that may be used to treat genital herpes\u00a0include famciclovir\u00a0and valaciclovir. \n For more information, see the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine or find more about your medication using the  electronic medicines compendium . \n Recurrent\u00a0outbreaks \n You should visit your GP if you have been diagnosed with genital herpes before and\u00a0are experiencing a recurrent outbreak. \n If the symptoms are mild, your GP may suggest\u00a0things you can do at home to help ease your symptoms without the need for treatment. \n \n Keep the affected area clean using either plain or salt water. This will help\u00a0prevent blisters or ulcers from becoming infected and may encourage them to heal quicker. It will also stop\u00a0affected areas from sticking together. \n Apply an ice pack wrapped in a flannel, or cold, wet, tea bags on the sores to help soothe pain and speed up the healing process. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. \n Apply petroleum jelly, such as Vaseline, or an anaesthetic (painkilling) cream, such as 5% lidocaine, to any blisters or ulcers to reduce the pain when you pass urine.\u00a0 \n Drink plenty of fluids to dilute your urine. This will make passing urine less painful. Passing urine while sitting in a bath or while pouring water over your genitals may also help. \n Avoid wearing tight clothing because it may irritate the blisters and ulcers. \n \n If your symptoms are more severe, you may be prescribed antiviral tablets (aciclovir), which you will need to take five times a day for five days. \n Episodic treatment \n If you have fewer than six recurrent\u00a0outbreaks of genital herpes in a year, your GP may prescribe a five-day course of aciclovir each time you experience tingling or numbness before symptoms begin. This is known as episodic treatment. \n Suppressive treatment \n If you have more than six recurrent\u00a0outbreaks of genital herpes in a year, or if your symptoms are particularly severe and causing you distress, you may need to take aciclovir every day as part of a long-term treatment plan. \n This is known as suppressive treatment and\u00a0aims to prevent further\u00a0outbreaks developing. In this instance, it is likely you will need to take aciclovir twice a day for six to 12 months. \n It is important to note that while suppressive treatment can reduce the risk of passing HSV on to your partner, it cannot prevent it altogether. Your GP may refer you for specialist advice if you are concerned about transmitting the virus to your partner. \n Suppressive treatment will usually be stopped after 12 months. As long as recurrent outbreaks of genital herpes\u00a0are infrequent and mild, you will only need to take a five-day course of aciclovir as and when it is needed. Episodes of recurrent genital herpes usually become less frequent and less severe after around two years. \n Suppressive treatment may be restarted if you have further severe outbreaks. Your GP may refer you for specialist treatment if you continue to have\u00a0outbreaks of genital herpes while you are having suppressive treatment. \n HIV and genital herpes \n If you are experiencing recurrent\u00a0outbreaks of genital herpes you should also consider being tested for  HIV .\u00a0This may be a sign of a weakened immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence against infection and illness), which may indicate\u00a0you have HIV.\u00a0 \n Read about\u00a0 diagnosing HIV  for more information about getting tested for this condition.\u00a0 \n If you have\u00a0HIV and genital herpes you will be referred to a GUM specialist. This is because genital herpes can be a more serious condition in people with HIV.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Genital herpes can be diagnosed more easily and accurately when the infection is still active, so you should seek medical attention as soon as you develop symptoms. \n Primary infection \n If you think you may have genital herpes for the first time (a primary infection), you should visit your local\u00a0sexual health clinic (see below) as soon as possible. These are also called genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics. \n  Find your nearest sexual health service  \n Wherever possible, an initial diagnosis of genital herpes should be made by a GUM specialist. If you cannot get to a GUM clinic, you should see your GP instead. They may refer you to a GUM specialist for a formal diagnosis and treatment. \n When being tested for genital herpes you may\u00a0also be asked: \n \n whether you have experienced similar symptoms before \n whether you have ever had a\u00a0 cold sore , which are also caused by the herpes simplex virus \n whether you have ever had a  sexually transmitted\u00a0infection (STI)  \n about your history of sexual partners \n \n A\u00a0swab is used to collect a sample of fluid from a blister. A swab is a small piece of absorbent material, such as gauze or cotton, which is attached to the end of a stick or wire. The sample will be sent to a laboratory to be tested for the herpes simplex virus (HSV). You may also be screened for other STIs. \n You should be aware that even if your swab result comes back negative for HSV, you may still have genital herpes and a diagnosis\u00a0will only be confirmed by any recurrent outbreaks.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Sexual health clinics \n What happens at a sexual health clinic? \n Some sexual health clinics are walk-in clinics, whereas others require you to book an appointment. Phone the clinic to find out. \n When you attend a clinic, you will be asked for some details including: \n \n your name and contact details \u2013 you do not have to give your real name or tell staff who your GP is if you do not want to, but\u00a0any details\u00a0you provide will be treated confidentially \n why you have attended the clinic \u2013 try not to be embarrassed and say\u00a0you think you may have a sexually transmitted infection (STI) \n your sexual history \u2013 for example, when you last had sex, whether you used a condom and whether you have had an STI in the past \n \n If you are attending the clinic for genital herpes, you may be offered tests for other STIs. You do not have to agree to have these tests, but it is recommended that you do. Tests can only be carried out with your consent. You may need to give a urine or blood sample\u00a0for other STI tests. \n Results from tests for STIs are usually available in a few weeks. If you need treatment, this will be discussed with you. \n If you have an STI, your partner (and recent previous partners) will need to be tested and, if necessary, treated to prevent the infection being passed to anyone else.\u00a0 \n Staff at the sexual health clinic will be able to advise you about which\u00a0of your sexual partners will need to be contacted, and\u00a0may\u00a0be able to contact them on your behalf. If you wish, your anonymity will be protected when contacting your previous sexual partners. \n Read more information about  visiting a sexual health clinic  \n Are sexual health services confidential? \n Check-ups and treatments for STIs at GP surgeries and GUM clinics are completely confidential. Your parents or carers will not be told, even if you are under 16 years of age. \n However, you may be advised to contact your partner and any previous partners so\u00a0they can be tested and treated as well. Staff at the GUM clinic may be able to help you with this. \n Referral to\u00a0a specialist\u00a0 \n If you have genital herpes and you are pregnant, it is very important you are referred for specialist treatment. This is because\u00a0the infection could pass to your unborn baby.\u00a0 \n Read about\u00a0 complications of genital herpes  for more information about genital herpes and pregnancy. \n You should also be referred for specialist treatment if you have a weakened immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system), for example, if you: \n \n have  HIV or AIDS  \n are receiving\u00a0 chemotherapy  (treatment for cancer) \n \n If you have a weakened immune system you will need specialist treatment because genital herpes can last longer and be more severe."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Gallstones", "introduction": "Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. In most cases they don't cause any symptoms and don't need to be treated. \n However, if a gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (opening) inside the gallbladder it can trigger a sudden intense abdominal pain that usually lasts between 1\u00a0and 5\u00a0hours. This type of abdominal pain is known as biliary colic. \n Some people with gallstones\u00a0can also\u00a0develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder ( cholecystitis ), which can cause: \n \n persistent pain \n jaundice\u00a0 \n a fever \n \n When gallstones cause symptoms or complications, it's known as gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. Read more about: \n \n  symptoms of gallstones  \n  complications of gallstones  \n \n The gallbladder \n The gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Its main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. \n Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fats. It's passed from the liver through a series of channels, known as bile ducts, into the gallbladder. \n The bile is stored in the gallbladder and over time it becomes more concentrated, which makes it better at digesting fats. The gallbladder releases bile into the digestive system when it's needed. \n What causes\u00a0gallstones? \n Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones. \n Gallstones are very common. It's estimated that more than 1\u00a0in every 10 adults in the UK\u00a0has gallstones, although only\u00a0a minority\u00a0of\u00a0people develop symptoms. \n You're more at risk of developing gallstones if you're: \n \n overweight\u00a0or obese\u00a0 \n female, particularly if you've had children \n 40 or over (the risk increases as you get older) \n \n Read more about: \n \n  causes of gallstones \u00a0 \n  preventing gallstones  \n \n Treating gallstones \n Treatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing: \n \n symptoms \u2013\u00a0such as  abdominal pain  \n complications \u2013 such as jaundice or  acute pancreatitis  \n \n In these cases, keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder may be recommended.\u00a0This procedure,\u00a0known as a  laparoscopic cholecystectomy , is relatively simple\u00a0to perform and has a low risk of complications. \n You can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. Your liver will still produce bile to digest food, but\u00a0the bile will just drip continuously into the small intestine, rather than\u00a0build up in the gallbladder. \n Read more about: \n \n  treating gallstones  \n  diagnosing gallstones  \n \n Outlook \n Most cases of gallstone disease are easily treated with surgery.\u00a0Very severe cases can be life-threatening, especially in people who are already in poor health. However, deaths from gallstone disease\u00a0are rare in the UK.", "symptoms": "Most cases of gallstones don't cause any symptoms. But if a gallstone blocks one of the bile ducts, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain, known as biliary colic. \n Other symptoms may develop\u00a0if the blockage is more severe or\u00a0develops in another part of the digestive system. \n Abdominal pain (biliary colic) \n Gallstones\u00a0can cause\u00a0sudden, severe abdominal pain that usually lasts 1\u00a0to 5\u00a0hours\u00a0(although it can sometimes last just a few minutes). \n The pain can be felt: \n \n in the centre of your abdomen (tummy) \n just under the ribs on your right-hand side \u2013\u00a0it may spread from here\u00a0to your side or shoulder blade \n \n The pain is constant and isn't relieved when you go to the toilet, pass wind or are sick.\u00a0It's sometimes triggered by eating fatty foods, but\u00a0may occur at any time of day\u00a0and it may wake you up during the night. \n Biliary colic doesn't happen often. After an episode of pain, it may be several weeks or months before you experience another episode. \n Some people also have periods where they sweat excessively and feel sick or vomit. \n When\u00a0gallstones cause episodes of biliary colic, it is known as 'uncomplicated gallstone disease'. \n Other symptoms \n In a small number of people, gallstones can cause more serious problems if they obstruct the flow of bile for longer periods or move into other organs (such as the pancreas or small bowel). \n If this happens,\u00a0you\u00a0may develop: \n \n a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above \n more persistent pain \n a rapid heartbeat \n yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n itchy skin \n  diarrhoea  \n chills or shivering attacks \n confusion \n a loss of appetite \n \n Doctors refer to this more severe condition as 'complicated gallstone disease'. \n Read more about the  complications of gallstones . \n When to seek medical advice \n If you think you may be experiencing biliary colic, you should make an appointment with your GP. \n Contact your GP immediately for advice if you develop: \n \n jaundice \n abdominal pain lasting longer than eight hours \n a high temperature and chills \n abdominal pain so intense that you can't find a position to relieve it \n \n If\u00a0it's not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local\u00a0 out-of-hours service  or call  NHS 24 111 service .", "causes": "Gallstones are thought to be caused by an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver to aid digestion. \n It's still unclear exactly what leads to this imbalance, but gallstones can form if: \n \n there are unusually high levels of cholesterol inside the gallbladder (about 4\u00a0in every 5\u00a0gallstones are made up of cholesterol) \n there are unusually high levels of a waste product called bilirubin inside the gallbladder (about 1\u00a0in every 5\u00a0gallstones is made up of bilirubin) \n \n These chemical imbalances cause tiny crystals to develop in the bile. These can gradually grow (often over many years) into solid stones that can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pebble. \n Sometimes only 1\u00a0stone will form, but there are often several at the same time. \n Who\u2019s at risk? \n Gallstones are more common if you: \n \n are female, particularly if you've had children,\u00a0are taking the combined Pill, or are undergoing high-dose\u00a0oestrogen therapy \n are overweight or\u00a0 obese  \n are aged 40 years or older (the older you are, the more likely you are to develop gallstones) \n have a condition that affects the flow of bile \u2013 such as  cirrhosis  (scarring of the liver), primary sclerosing cholangitis, or\u00a0 obstetric cholestasis \u00a0 \n have  Crohn's disease  or  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  \n have a close family member who's also had gallstones \n have recently lost weight (from either\u00a0dieting or weight-loss surgery) \n are taking an antibiotic called ceftriaxone", "treatment": "Your treatment plan for gallstones depends on how the symptoms are affecting your daily life. \n If you don't have any symptoms, a policy of 'active monitoring' is often recommended. This means you won't receive immediate treatment, but you should let your GP know if you notice any symptoms. \n As a general rule, the longer you go without symptoms, the less likely it is that your condition will get worse. \n You may need treatment if you have a condition that increases your risk of\u00a0developing complications, such as: \n \n scarring of the liver ( cirrhosis ) \n high blood pressure inside the liver \u2013 this is known as portal hypertension and is often a complication of\u00a0 alcohol-related liver disease  \n  diabetes  \n \n Treatment may also be recommended if a scan shows high levels of calcium inside your gallbladder, as this can lead to\u00a0 gallbladder cancer  in later life. \n If you have episodes of abdominal pain (biliary colic), treatment depends on how the pain affects your daily activities. If\u00a0the episodes are\u00a0mild and infrequent, you may be prescribed painkillers to control further episodes and given advice about\u00a0eating a healthy diet to help control the pain. \n If your symptoms are more severe and occur frequently,\u00a0surgery to remove the gallbladder\u00a0is usually recommended. \n The gallbladder isn't an essential organ and\u00a0you can lead a perfectly normal life without one.\u00a0Some people may experience symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating fatty or spicy food. If certain foods do trigger symptoms, you may wish to avoid them in the future. \n Keyhole surgery to remove the gallbladder \n If surgery is recommended, you'll usually have keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder. This is known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. \n During\u00a0a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small cuts are made in your abdomen. One larger cut (about 2-3cm) will be by the belly button and the others (each 1cm or less) will be on the right side of your abdomen. \n Your abdomen is temporarily inflated using carbon dioxide gas. This is harmless and makes it easier for the surgeon to see your organs. \n A\u00a0laparoscope (long thin telescope with a tiny light and video camera at the end) is inserted through one of the cuts in your abdomen. This allows your surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor.\u00a0Your surgeon will then remove your gallbladder using special surgical instruments. \n If it's thought there may be gallstones in the bile duct, an X-ray or ultrasound scan of the bile duct is also taken during the operation. If gallstones are found, they may be removed during keyhole surgery. If the operation can't be done this way or an unexpected complication occurs, it may have to be converted to open surgery (see below). \n After the gallbladder has been removed, the gas in your abdomen escapes through the laparoscope and the cuts are closed with dissolvable stitches and covered with dressings. \n Laparoscopic cholecystectomies are\u00a0usually performed under a  general anaesthetic , which means you'll be asleep during the procedure and won't feel any pain while it's carried out. The operation takes 60-90 minutes and you can usually go home the same\u00a0day.\u00a0Full recovery typically takes around 10 days. \n Single-incision keyhole surgery \n Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a newer type of keyhole surgery used to remove the gallbladder. During this type of surgery, only one small cut is made, which means you'll only have one\u00a0barely visible scar. \n However, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomies haven\u2019t been carried out as often as conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomies, so there are still some uncertainties about it. Access to this type of surgery is also limited because it needs an experienced surgeon with specialist training. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has more information on\u00a0 single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy . \n Open surgery \n A\u00a0laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not always be recommended, for example if you: \n \n are in the third trimester (the last three months) of pregnancy \n are extremely overweight \n have an unusual gallbladder or bile duct structure that makes a\u00a0keyhole procedure difficult and potentially dangerous \n \n In these circumstances, an open cholecystectomy may be recommended. During this procedure, a 10-15cm (4-6in) incision is made in your abdomen underneath the ribs so the gallbladder can be removed.\u00a0This\u00a0is done under general anaesthetic, so you'll be asleep and won't feel any pain. \n Open surgery is just as effective as laparoscopic surgery, but it does have a longer recovery time and causes more visible scarring. Most people have to stay in hospital for up to 5\u00a0days and it typically takes 6\u00a0weeks to fully recover. \n Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) \n An endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure that can be used to remove gallstones from the bile duct. The gallbladder isn't removed during this procedure, so any stones in the gallbladder will remain unless removed using the surgical techniques mentioned above. \n ERCP is similar to a diagnostic cholangiography (see  diagnosing gallstones  for more information), where an endoscope (long, thin flexible tube with a camera at the end) is passed through your mouth down to where the bile duct opens into the small intestine. \n However, during ERCP the\u00a0opening of the bile duct\u00a0is widened with a small incision or an electrically heated wire. The bile duct stones are then removed or left to pass into your intestine and out of your body. \n Sometimes a small tube called a stent is permanently placed in the bile duct to help the bile and stones pass. \n An ERCP is usually carried out under sedation, which means you'll be awake throughout the procedure but won't experience any pain. \n The ERCP procedure\u00a0lasts about 30 minutes on average, but can take from 15 minutes to over an hour.\u00a0You may need to stay overnight in hospital after the procedure so you can be monitored. \n Medication to dissolve gallstones \n If your\u00a0gallstones are small and don't contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid\u00a0tablets to dissolve them. \n However, these aren't\u00a0prescribed very often because: \n \n they're\u00a0rarely very effective \n they need to be taken for a long time (up to 2\u00a0years) \n gallstones can recur once treatment is stopped \n \n Side effects of ursodeoxycholic acid are uncommon and are usually mild. The most commonly reported side effects are feeling sick, being sick and itchy skin. \n The use of ursodeoxycholic acid isn't usually recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Sexually active women should use either a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, or a low-dose oestrogen contraceptive pill while taking ursodeoxycholic acid, as it may affect other types of oral contraceptive pills. \n Ursodeoxycholic acid tablets are occasionally also prescribed as a precaution against gallstones if it's thought you're at risk of developing them. For example, you may be prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid if you've recently had weight loss surgery, as rapid weight loss can cause gallstones to grow.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Gallstones may be discovered during tests for a different condition, as they often don't cause any symptoms. \n If you do have  symptoms of gallstones ,\u00a0make an appointment with your GP so they can try to identify the problem. \n Seeing your GP \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms in detail and may\u00a0carry out the Murphy's sign test to help determine if your gallbladder is inflamed. \n During this test, your\u00a0GP places their hand or fingers on the upper-right area of your tummy and asks you to breathe in. If you find this painful, it usually\u00a0means your gallbladder is inflamed and you may need urgent treatment. \n Your GP may also recommend having\u00a0 blood tests  to look for signs of infection, or to check if your liver is working normally.\u00a0If gallstones have moved into your bile duct, the liver may not be able to\u00a0function properly. \n Further tests \n If your symptoms and test results suggest you may have gallstones, you'll usually be referred for further tests. You may be admitted to hospital for tests the same day if your symptoms suggest you have a more severe form of gallbladder disease. \n Ultrasound scan \n Gallstones can usually be confirmed using an ultrasound scan, which uses high frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of the body. \n The type of ultrasound scan used for gallstones\u00a0is similar to the scan used during pregnancy, where a small handheld device called a transducer is placed onto your skin and moved over your upper abdomen. \n Sound waves are sent from the\u00a0transducer, through your skin and into your body. They bounce back off the body tissues, forming an image\u00a0on a monitor. This is a painless procedure that usually takes about 10-15 minutes to complete. \n When gallstones are diagnosed, there may be some uncertainty about whether any stones have passed into the bile duct. \n Gallstones in the bile duct are sometimes seen during an ultrasound scan.\u00a0If they're not visible but your\u00a0tests\u00a0suggest the bile duct may be affected, you may need an MRI scan or a cholangiography. \n MRI scan \n A  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  may be carried out to look for gallstones in the bile ducts. This type of scan uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. \n Cholangiography \n A procedure called a cholangiography can give further information about the condition of your gallbladder. \n A cholangiography uses a dye that shows up on  X-rays . The dye\u00a0may be injected into your bloodstream or injected directly into your bile ducts during surgery or using an\u00a0endoscope\u00a0passed through your mouth. \n After the dye has been introduced, X-ray images are taken. They'll reveal any abnormality in your bile or pancreatic systems. If your gallbladder and bile systems are working normally, the dye will be absorbed in the places it's meant to go (your liver, bile ducts, intestines and gallbladder). \n If a blockage is detected during this test, your doctor may try to remove\u00a0it at this point using an endoscope. This is known as\u00a0an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ganglion cyst", "introduction": "A ganglion cyst is a fluid-filled swelling that usually develops near a joint or tendon. The cyst can range from the size of a pea to the size of a golf ball. \n Ganglion cysts look and feel like a smooth lump under the skin. They're made up of a thick, jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate and cushion them during movement. \n Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most common\u00a0on the wrist (particularly the back of the wrist), and the hand and fingers. \n Ganglions are harmless, but can sometimes be painful. If they don't cause any pain or discomfort, they can be left alone and may disappear without treatment, although this can take a number of years. \n It's not clear why ganglions form. They seem to occur when the synovial fluid that surrounds a joint or tendon leaks out and collects in a sac. \n Treatment options \n Treatment is usually only recommended if the cyst causes pain or affects the range of movement in a joint. \n The two main treatment options for a ganglion cyst are: \n \n draining fluid out of the cyst with a needle and syringe\u00a0\u2013 the medical term for this is aspiration \n cutting the cyst out using surgery \n \n Availability on the NHS \n Most\u00a0clinical commissioning\u00a0groups (CCGs)\u00a0don't fund treatment for ganglion cysts unless they cause significant pain or disrupt daily activities. \n If you want to have a cyst removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll probably have to pay for private treatment. \n Aspiration \n Aspiration is usually carried out in the outpatient department of your local hospital or GP surgery. Your doctor will remove as much of the contents of the ganglion as possible with a needle and syringe. \n The area is sometimes also injected with a dose of steroid\u00a0medication to help prevent the ganglion returning, although there's no clear evidence\u00a0this reduces the risk of recurrence. \n After the procedure,\u00a0a plaster is placed over the small hole in your skin and can be removed about six hours after the procedure. \n Aspiration is a simple and painless procedure, and you'll be able to leave the hospital or surgery straight afterwards. It's often the first treatment option offered for ganglion cysts as it's less invasive than surgery. \n However,\u00a0around\u00a0half of\u00a0all\u00a0ganglion cysts treated using aspiration return at some point. If a cyst does return, surgery may be necessary. \n Surgery \n There are two ways surgery can be used to remove a ganglion cyst: \n \n open surgery \u2013 where the surgeon makes a medium-sized cut, usually about 5cm (2 inches) long,\u00a0over the site of the affected joint or tendon \n  arthroscopic surgery \u00a0\u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where smaller incisions are made and\u00a0a tiny camera called an arthroscope is used by the surgeon to look inside the joint;\u00a0using the arthroscope as a guide, they then pass instruments through the incision to remove the cyst \n \n Both techniques can be performed under either local anaesthetic, where you are\u00a0awake but won't feel any pain, or  general anaesthetic , where\u00a0you are asleep during the operation. \n The choice depends on where the ganglion is, which anaesthetic you'd prefer, and what your surgeon thinks is best. \n Open or keyhole surgery? \n Both techniques are equally effective at removing the cyst and reducing the risk of it returning. \n Keyhole surgery tends to cause less pain after the operation, but  waiting times  are often longer. \n After the operation \n The surgeon will stitch up the wound and a bandage will be placed over the area. This helps keep the area clean,\u00a0reducing the risk of infection, as well as keeping it safe from any accidental bumps. The wound isn't usually painful, but you'll be given painkillers to take if you feel any discomfort after the operation. \n If the cyst was removed from your wrist or hand, you may need to wear a sling for the first few days. This helps keep your arm safe from any accidental knocks, and may help reduce swelling and discomfort. Move your fingers regularly to help keep the joints flexible. \n Surgery to remove a ganglion cyst leaves a scar, which can occasionally be thick and red. For some people, the skin around the scar remains numb after the operation. \n You'll usually\u00a0experience some bruising in the area after your operation, but this should fade quickly. There's also a small possibility of\u00a0temporary stiffness, swelling or pain afterwards. This may be caused by a minor infection that can be treated using  antibiotics . Lasting pain or stiffness may need further treatment with physiotherapy. \n How much time you need to take off work after surgery to remove a ganglion cyst largely depends on where the ganglion is and your job. If your job involves manual labour, you may need to take time off. You can usually start driving again once it feels safe. \n Complications \n Having a ganglion cyst removed is a minor procedure, so complications are rare and seldom serious. However, a small number of people experience permanent stiffness and pain after surgery. \n If you have the operation under general anaesthetic, there's also a very small risk of complications to your heart and lungs.\u00a0Pre-assessment tests before surgery should make sure your risks are as low as possible. \n There's always a chance a ganglion cyst will come back after treatment. This is more likely if the ganglion is on certain areas of the wrist.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Gastroenteritis", "introduction": "Gastroenteritis is a very common condition that causes diarrhoea and vomiting. It's usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug. \n It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. \n Most cases in children are caused by a virus called rotavirus. Cases in adults are usually caused by\u00a0 norovirus  (the \"winter vomiting bug\") or bacterial\u00a0 food poisoning . \n Gastroenteritis can be very unpleasant, but it usually clears up by itself within a week. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home until you're feeling better. \n Try to avoid going to your GP, as gastroenteritis can spread to others very easily. Call\u00a0 NHS 24 111 service \u00a0or your GP if you're concerned or need any advice. \n This page covers: \n  Symptoms of gastroenteritis  \n  What to do if you have gastroenteritis  \n  When to get medical advice  \n  Looking after a child with gastroenteritis  \n  Getting medical advice for your child  \n  How gastroenteritis is spread  \n  Preventing gastroenteritis  \n Symptoms of gastroenteritis \n The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are: \n \n sudden, watery\u00a0 diarrhoea  \n feeling sick \n vomiting, which can be projectile \n a mild fever \n \n Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an  upset stomach , aching limbs and headaches. \n The symptoms usually appear up to a day after becoming infected. They typically last less than a week, but can sometimes last longer. \n What to do if you have gastroenteritis \n If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you're feeling better.\u00a0There's not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course. \n You don't usually need to get medical advice, unless your symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem. \n To help ease your symptoms: \n \n Drink plenty of fluids to avoid  dehydration  \u2013 You need to drink more than\u00a0usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is best, but you could also try fruit juice and soup. \n Take\u00a0 paracetamol  for any fever or aches and pains. \n Get plenty of rest. \n If you feel like eating, try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. \n Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have  signs of dehydration , such as a\u00a0 dry mouth  or dark urine \u2013 read about\u00a0 treating dehydration . \n Take anti-vomiting medication (such as metoclopramide) and/or antidiarrhoeal medication (such as loperamide) if you need to \u2013 some types are available from pharmacies, but check the leaflet that comes with the medicine. You can also ask your pharmacist or GP for advice about whether they're suitable.\u00a0 \n \n Gastroenteritis can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you're ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on (see  Preventing gastroenteritis ). \n When to get medical advice \n You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own. \n Visiting your GP surgery can put others at risk, so it's best to call\u00a0NHS 111 or your GP if you're concerned or feel you need advice. \n Get medical advice if: \n \n you have  symptoms of severe dehydration , such as persistent  dizziness , only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or if you're losing consciousness \n you have bloody diarrhoea \n you're vomiting constantly and are unable to keep down any fluids \n you have a fever over 38C (100.4F) \n your symptoms haven't started to improve after a few days \n in the last few weeks you've returned from a part of the world with poor sanitation \n you have a serious underlying condition, such as  kidney disease , inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting \n \n Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your\u00a0poo to a laboratory to check what's causing your symptoms.  Antibiotics \u00a0may be prescribed if this shows you have a bacterial infection. \n Looking after a child with gastroenteritis \n You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There's not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days. \n You don't normally need to get medical advice unless their symptoms don't improve or there's a risk of a more serious problem. \n To help ease your child's\u00a0symptoms: \n \n Encourage them to drink plenty of fluids.\u00a0They need to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Water is generally best. Avoid giving them fizzy drinks or fruit juice, as they can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds. \n Make sure they get plenty of rest. \n Let your child eat if they're eating solids and feel hungry. Try small amounts of plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread. \n Give them\u00a0 paracetamol  if they have an uncomfortable\u00a0fever or aches and pains. Young children may find liquid paracetamol easier to swallow than tablets. \n Use special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if they're dehydrated. Your GP or pharmacist can advise on how much to give your child. Don't give them antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist. \n \n Make sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill and keep them\u00a0away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared (see  Preventing gastroenteritis ). \n Getting medical advice for your child \n You don't\u00a0usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP surgery can put others at risk. \n Call NHS 24 111 service or your GP if you're concerned about your child, or they: \n \n have\u00a0 symptoms of dehydration , such as passing less urine than normal, being unusually irritable or unresponsive, pale or mottled skin, or cold hands and feet \n have blood in their poo or green vomit \n are vomiting constantly and are\u00a0unable to keep down any fluids or feeds \n have had diarrhoea for more than a week \n have been vomiting for three days or more \n have\u00a0 signs of a more serious illness , such as a high fever (over 38C or 100.4F), shortness of breath, rapid breathing, a stiff neck, a rash that doesn't fade when you roll a glass over it or a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby's head) \n have a serious underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a weak immune system, and have diarrhoea and vomiting \n \n Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child's poo to a laboratory to confirm what's causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection. \n How gastroenteritis is spread \n The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person. \n You can catch\u00a0the infection\u00a0if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through: \n \n close contact with someone with\u00a0gastroenteritis \u2013 they may breathe out small particles of vomit \n touching contaminated surfaces or objects \n eating contaminated food \u2013\u00a0this can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn't been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures (read more about the  causes of food poisoning ) \n \n A person with\u00a0gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until\u00a048 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this. \n Preventing gastroenteritis \n It's not always possible to avoid getting\u00a0gastroenteritis, but following the advice below can help stop it spreading: \n \n Stay off work, school or nursery until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have passed. You or your child should also avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time. \n Ensure you and your child wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water, particularly after using the toilet and before preparing food. Don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they're not always effective. \n Disinfect any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated. It's best to use a bleach-based household cleaner. \n Wash contaminated items of clothing or bedding separately on a hot wash. \n Don't share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils while you or your child is ill. \n Flush away any poo or vomit in the toilet or potty and clean the surrounding area. \n Practice good food hygiene. Make sure food is properly refrigerated, always cook your food thoroughly, and never eat food that is past its use-by date \u2013 read more about  preventing food poisoning .\u00a0 \n \n Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it. \n Young children can have the\u00a0 rotavirus vaccination  when they\u2019re 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Foetal alcohol syndrome", "introduction": "If a woman drinks alcohol\u00a0at any time during pregnancy, she risks damaging her baby. The mental and physical problems that can develop in the baby are known as \"foetal alcohol syndrome\". \n Foetal alcohol syndrome, also referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome,\u00a0is completely avoidable if you\u00a0don't drink alcohol while you're pregnant. \n Experts are still unsure exactly how much alcohol is safe for you to have while pregnant, which is why not drinking at all is the safest approach. \n How would alcohol reach the unborn baby? \n A\u00a0baby in the womb\u00a0gets its nourishment from the mother's bloodstream. \n If the mother drinks alcohol, this easily passes from her blood through the placenta to her baby's blood. \n A baby's liver is one of the last organs to develop fully and doesn't mature until the later stages of pregnancy. This means that the baby cannot process alcohol as well as the mother can. \n What effect does alcohol have on the baby? \n Exposure to alcohol can seriously affect the baby's development, particularly the brain and spinal cord.\u00a0 \n Alcohol damages the important cells in the baby's body that are necessary for growth and also disrupts the connection of the nerves in the brain. The damage to the cells by alcohol results in poor growth, smaller body size and a delay in development. \n Alcohol is potentially most\u00a0harmful for the baby in the first three months of pregnancy. At this stage, it is linked to\u00a0 miscarriage  and birth abnormalities.\u00a0However, alcohol can harm a baby at any stage\u00a0of pregnancy. \n Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems: binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol. However, there is no \"safe\" level of alcohol use during pregnancy. \n What are the symptoms of foetal alcohol syndrome? \n Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been associated with miscarriage,\u00a0 stillbirth , premature labour\u00a0and problems with the way the baby grows and develops in the womb. \n A baby exposed to alcohol in the womb is more\u00a0prone to illness, physical problems, and learning and behavioural disorders. It may have any of the following problems: \n \n poor growth while in the womb and after birth, so the baby is shorter and smaller than average, sometimes with deformed limbs\u00a0 \n small head and jaw \n distinctive facial features, especially: small eyes set far apart, a thin upper lip, a smooth philtrum (ridge that runs below the nose to the top lip)\u00a0\u00a0 \n cerebral palsy \u2013 a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles, which affects movement and co-ordination \n learning disorders \u2013 problems with\u00a0thinking, speech, social skills and/or\u00a0memory (for example, finding it difficult to\u00a0translate thinking into saying, or reading into speaking)\u00a0 \n mood, attention or behavioural\u00a0problems \u2013 for example,\u00a0autistic-like behaviour,\u00a0 ADHD  or sleep problems \n problems with the\u00a0liver, kidneys, heart or other organs \n hearing and sight problems \n  epilepsy\u00a0  \n a weak immune system \n \n Some children may only develop mild symptoms, while others may be severely affected. \n If children with foetal alcohol syndrome are not diagnosed early and given the support they need, they are likely to face a range of issues in later life. Because of their problems, they\u00a0may misuse drugs and alcohol and become expelled from school, develop mental health problems, and\u00a0find it difficult to get\u00a0a job and live independently as adults. \n How is foetal alcohol syndrome diagnosed? \n Doctors\u00a0may suspect foetal alcohol syndrome\u00a0in a baby after it has been born if it has some of the distinctive facial features and hasn't grown fully, and it's thought that the mother\u00a0drank alcohol during pregnancy. \n However, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed until the child shows clear features of delayed development and the mother's alcohol habit has been confirmed. \n Doctors do also check for other causes of the child's delayed development, including genetic abnormalities. They will usually carry out a thorough physical examination of the baby to check for physical abnormalities. \n Some\u00a0children who have suffered brain damage from alcohol won't have the classic facial features of foetal alcohol syndrome, but they could still be severely affected. So it's important that children who show some or all of the behavioural and developmental problems described are assessed if it's known that the mother drank alcohol in pregnancy. \n What's the outlook for a child with\u00a0foetal alcohol syndrome? \n There is no particular treatment for a child with foetal alcohol syndrome. The brain damage is not reversible, although early assessment and diagnosis does make all the difference to the child's progress in life. \n It's important that the child is referred to a team of healthcare professionals who are experienced in assessing and diagnosing foetal alcohol syndrome and who can also advise on the appropriate educational and behavioural strategies for the children.\u00a0The child will then be better equipped to cope with their physical, behavioural and developmental problems.\u00a0 \n Children with foetal alcohol syndrome do tend to have growth delay. The facial deformities may sometimes be less noticeable as the child ages, but they may be shorter than average and have a much smaller head size. \n Where can I go for support? \n It's never too late to stop drinking. \n If you're pregnant and\u00a0struggling\u00a0with an alcohol\u00a0problem,\u00a0ask\u00a0your midwife, doctor or pharmacist for support or advice. They may recommend that you join a\u00a0rehabilitation programme. \n Confidential help and support is also\u00a0available from local counselling services (contact Drinkline on 0300 123 1110) or\u00a0 NOFAS . \n Read advice on  how to cut down on drinking", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Food poisoning", "introduction": "Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment. \n In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as\u00a0salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the  norovirus . \n Signs and symptoms \n The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later. \n The main symptoms include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) \n vomiting \n  diarrhoea , which may contain blood or mucus \n stomach cramps and\u00a0 abdominal (tummy) pain  \n a lack of energy and weakness \n loss of appetite \n a high temperature (fever) \n aching muscles \n chills \n \n In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery. \n What to do \n Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below). \n Until you feel better, you should rest and drink fluids to prevent  dehydration . Try to drink plenty of water, even if you can only sip it. \n Eat when you feel up to it, but try small, light meals at first and stick to bland foods \u2013 such as toast, crackers, bananas and rice \u2013 until you begin to feel better. \n Oral rehydration solutions (ORS), which are available from pharmacies, are recommended for more vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those with another health condition. \n Read more about  treating food poisoning  \n When to see your GP \n You should\u00a0contact your GP if: \n \n your symptoms are severe \u2013 for example, if\u00a0you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly \n your symptoms don't start to improve after a few days \n you have  symptoms of severe dehydration , such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine \n you're pregnant \n you're over 60 \n your\u00a0baby or\u00a0young child has suspected food poisoning \n you have a\u00a0long-term underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart valve disease,  diabetes  or  kidney disease  \n you have a weak immune system \u2013 for example, because of medication,  cancer  treatment or  HIV  \n \n In these situations, your GP may send off a stool sample for analysis and prescribe  antibiotics , or they may refer you to hospital so you can be looked after more closely. \n How is food contaminated? \n Food can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking. For example, it can be contaminated\u00a0by: \n \n not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat) \n not correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C \n leaving cooked food for too long at warm temperatures \n not sufficiently reheating previously cooked food \n someone who is ill or who has dirty hands touching the food \n eating food that has passed its \"use by\" date \n the spread of bacteria between contaminated foods (cross-contamination) \n \n Foods particularly susceptible to contamination if not handled, stored or cooked properly include: \n \n raw meat and poultry \n raw eggs \n raw shellfish \n unpasteurised milk \n \"ready-to-eat\" foods, such as cooked sliced meats, p\u00e2t\u00e9, soft cheeses and pre-packed sandwiches \n \n Read more about the  causes of food poisoning  and  preventing food poisoning", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Food can become contaminated at any stage during its production, processing or cooking. \n For example,\u00a0it can become contaminated by: \n \n not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat) \n not\u00a0correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C \n keeping cooked food unrefrigerated for a long period \n eating food that has been touched by someone who is ill or has been in contact with someone with\u00a0 diarrhoea  and\u00a0 vomiting  \n cross-contamination (where harmful bacteria are spread between food, surfaces and equipment) \n \n Cross-contamination can occur, for example, if you prepare raw chicken on a chopping board and don't wash the board before preparing food that won't be cooked (such as salad), as the harmful bacteria can be spread from the chopping board to the salad. \n It\u00a0can also occur if raw meat is stored above ready-to-eat meals and juices from the meat drip on to the food below. \n See\u00a0 preventing food poisoning  for information about reducing these risks \n Types of infection \n Food contamination is usually caused by bacteria, but it can also sometimes be caused by viruses or parasites. Some of the main sources of contamination are described below. \n Campylobacter \n In the UK, campylobacter bacteria are the most common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria are usually found on raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurised milk and untreated water. \n The incubation period (the time between eating contaminated food and the start of symptoms) for food poisoning caused by campylobacter is usually between two and five days. The symptoms usually last less than a week. \n Salmonella \n Salmonella bacteria are often found in raw or undercooked meat, raw eggs, milk, and other dairy products. \n The incubation period is usually between 12 and 72 hours. The symptoms usually last around four to seven days. \n Listeria \n Listeria bacteria may be found in a range of chilled, \"ready-to-eat\" foods, including pre-packed sandwiches, cooked sliced meats and p\u00e2t\u00e9, and soft cheeses (such as Brie or Camembert). \n All of these foods should be eaten by their \"use-by\" dates. This is particularly important for pregnant women, because a listeria infection (known as listeriosis) in pregnancy can cause pregnancy and birth complications, and can result in  miscarriage . \n The incubation period can vary considerably, from a few days to several weeks. The symptoms will usually pass within three days. \n Escherichia coli (E. coli) \n Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness. \n Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. \n The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is typically one to eight days. The symptoms usually last for a few days or weeks. \n Shigella \n Shigella bacteria can\u00a0contaminate any food that has been washed in contaminated water. \n Symptoms typically develop within seven days of eating contaminated food and last for up to a week. \n An infection caused by Shigella bacteria is known as bacillary dysentery or shigellosis. See the topic on dysentery for more information about it. \n Viruses \n The virus that most commonly causes diarrhoea and vomiting is the  norovirus . It's easily spread from person to person, through contaminated food or water. Raw shellfish, particularly oysters, can also be a source of infection. \n The incubation period typically lasts 24-48 hours and the symptoms usually pass in a couple of days. \n In young children, the rotavirus is a common cause of infection from contaminated food. The symptoms usually develop within a week and pass in around five to seven days. \n Parasites \n In the UK, food poisoning\u00a0caused by parasites is rare. It's much more common in the developing world. \n Parasitic infections that can be spread in contaminated food include: \n \n giardiasis \u2013 an infection caused by a parasite called Giardia intestinalis \n cryptosporidiosis \u2013 an infection caused by a parasite called Cryptosporidium \n ameobiasis \u2013 a type of dysentery caused by a single-cell parasite (ameoba) called Entamoeba histolytica (this is very rare in the UK) \n \n The symptoms of food poisoning caused by a parasite usually develop within 10 days of eating contaminated food, although sometimes it may be weeks before you feel unwell. \n If left untreated, the symptoms can last a long time \u2013 sometimes several weeks or even a few months.", "treatment": "Food poisoning can usually be treated at home without seeking medical advice. Most people will feel better within a few days. \n It's important to avoid\u00a0 dehydration \u00a0by drinking plenty of water, even if you can only sip it,\u00a0as you need to replace any\u00a0fluids\u00a0lost through vomiting and  diarrhoea . \n You should also: \n \n rest as much as possible \n eat when you feel up to it\u00a0\u2013 sticking to small, light and non-fatty meals at first (bland foods such as\u00a0toast, crackers, rice and bananas are good choices) \n avoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks\u00a0and spicy and fatty foods because they may make you feel worse \n \n Contact\u00a0your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't start to improve in a few days. \n Preventing the spread of infection \n If you have food poisoning, you shouldn't prepare food for other people and you should try to keep contact with vulnerable people, such as the elderly or very young, to a minimum. \n Stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the last episode of diarrhoea. \n If someone you live with has food poisoning, you\u00a0should: \n \n make sure everyone in your household (including yourself) washes their hands with soap and warm water regularly \u2013 particularly after going to the toilet and before and after preparing food \n clean surfaces,\u00a0toilet seats, flush handles, basins and taps frequently \n make sure everyone has their own towels and flannels \n wash the laundry of\u00a0the infected person on the hottest washing machine setting \n \n Oral rehydration\u00a0solution (ORS) \n Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are recommended for people vulnerable to the effects of dehydration, such as the elderly and those with a pre-existing health condition. \n ORSs are available in sachets from pharmacies. You dissolve them in water to drink and they help replace salt, glucose and other important minerals your body loses through dehydration. \n If you have a kidney condition, some types of oral rehydration salts may not be suitable for you. Ask your pharmacist or GP for further advice about this. \n Further treatment \n If your symptoms are severe or persistent, or you are more vulnerable to serious infection (for example, because you are elderly or have an underlying health condition), you may need further treatment. \n Tests may be carried out on a stool sample to find out what it causing your symptoms and  antibiotics  may be prescribed if the results show you have a bacterial infection. \n Medication to stop you vomiting (anti-emetics) may also be prescribed if your vomiting is particularly severe. \n In some cases, you may need to be admitted to hospital for a few days so you can be monitored and given fluids directly into a vein (intravenously).", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It's not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat. \n The infection develops slowly and causes the nail to become discoloured, thickened and distorted. \n Toenails are more frequently affected than the fingernails. \n The medical name for a fungal nail infection is onychomycosis. \n Signs and symptoms of a fungal nail infection \n A fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first. \n As it progresses, the infection can cause: \n \n discolouration of the nail \u2013 it may turn\u00a0white, black, yellow or green \n thickening and distortion of the nail \u2013 it may become an unusual shape or texture and be\u00a0difficult to trim \n pain or discomfort \u2013 particularly when using or placing pressure on the affected toe or finger \n brittle or crumbly nails \u2013 pieces may break off and come away completely \n \n Sometimes the skin nearby may also become infected and be itchy and cracked or red and swollen. \n How do you get a fungal nail infection? \n Most fungal nail infections occur as a result of\u00a0the fungi that cause athlete's foot infecting the nails. \n These fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. The fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet. \n You're more likely to get a fungal nail infection if you: \n \n don't keep your feet clean and dry \n wear shoes that cause your feet to get hot and sweaty \n walk around barefoot in places where fungal infections can spread easily, such as communal showers, locker rooms and gyms \n have damaged\u00a0your nails \n have a weakened immune system \n have certain other health conditions, such as\u00a0 diabetes ,  psoriasis \u00a0or peripheral arterial disease\u00a0 \n \n Fungal nail infections can be spread to other people, so you should take steps to avoid this (see below)\u00a0if you have an infection. \n Treatments for fungal nail infections \n Treatment isn't always needed for\u00a0a mild fungal nail\u00a0infection because it's unlikely to cause any further problems and you may feel it's not worth treating. \n Whether you decide to have treatment or not, you should\u00a0still practise good foot hygiene (see below) to stop the infection getting worse or\u00a0spreading to others. \n Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're\u00a0bothered by the appearance of the affected nail, or it's causing problems such as pain and discomfort. They'll probably recommend: \n \n antifungal tablets\u00a0\u2013 tablets taken once or twice a day for several months \n antifungal nail paints \u2013 special paints applied directly to the nail over several months \n nail softening kits \u2013 where a paste is used to soften infected parts of the nail, before they're removed with a scraping device \n \n A procedure to remove the\u00a0nail completely may be recommended\u00a0in severe cases. Laser treatment, where a high-energy laser is used to destroy the fungus, is also an option. But this is\u00a0only available privately\u00a0and can be expensive. \n Read more about  treating a fungal nail infection . \n Preventing fungal nail infections \n You can reduce your risk of developing a fungal nail infection\u00a0by: \n \n keeping your\u00a0hands and feet\u00a0clean and dry \n wearing well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks\u00a0\u2013 these\u00a0will allow your feet to \"breathe\" \n clipping your nails to keep them short\u00a0\u2013 don't share clippers or scissors with other people \n not sharing towels and socks with other people, and ensure your towels are washed regularly \n not\u00a0walking around barefoot\u00a0in public pools, showers, and locker rooms\u00a0\u2013 special\u00a0shower shoes are available to protect your feet \n replacing old footwear\u00a0that could be contaminated with fungi \n treating athlete's foot\u00a0as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails \n \n Nail salon equipment can sometimes be the source of fungal nail infections. If you regularly visit a salon, make sure any equipment used is properly sterilised between uses.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases of fungal nail infection. For more severe or troublesome cases, antifungal medication may be recommended. \n A fungal nail infection is unlikely to get better without treatment, but if you're not bothered by it you might decide it's not worth treating because treatment can take a long time, may cause side effects, and isn't always effective. \n Whether or not you decide to have treatment, you should still follow the self-help advice below to help stop the condition getting worse or spreading to others. \n Things you can try \n The advice below may be helpful if you have a fungal nail infection: \n \n keep your\u00a0hands and feet\u00a0clean and dry \n wear well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks\u00a0\u2013 these\u00a0will allow your feet to \"breathe\" \n clip your nails to keep them short\u00a0\u2013 use a separate pair of clippers or scissors for the infected nail \n don't share towels and socks with other people, and ensure your towels are washed regularly \n don't walk around barefoot\u00a0in public pools, showers, and locker rooms\u00a0\u2013 special\u00a0shower shoes are available to protect your feet \n consider replacing old footwear\u00a0as it could be the source of the infection \n treat athlete's foot\u00a0as soon as possible to avoid the infection spreading to your nails \n \n Antifungal medication \n Speak to your GP or pharmacist if you're embarrassed by the appearance of the affected nail, or it's causing problems such as pain and discomfort. \n They'll usually recommend treatment with antifungal medication, either in the form of tablets or a special paint you apply directly to the nail. \n A small sample of the infected nail may need to be\u00a0taken and sent off for testing before treatment starts, to confirm that you do have a fungal infection. \n Antifungal tablets \n Terbinafine\u00a0and itraconazole\u00a0are the two medicines most commonly prescribed for fungal nail infections. \n These\u00a0usually need to be taken\u00a0once or twice a day for several months to ensure the infection has completely cleared up. If you stop taking\u00a0the medication too early, the infection may return. \n Possible side effects of antifungal tablets can include  headache , itching,  diarrhoea , loss of sense of taste, and a rash. \n Antifungal nail paint \n If you prefer not to take antifungal tablets, your GP or pharmacist may suggest you try antifungal nail paint instead. \n Nail paint isn't generally considered to be as effective as tablets because it can be difficult for it to reach the deeper layers of the nail. However, it doesn't usually cause any side effects. \n Like antifungal tablets,\u00a0antifungal nail paint also\u00a0normally needs to be used for several months\u00a0to ensure that the infection has cleared up. \n Results of treatment \n Antifungal treatments are thought to be effective in treating about 60-80% of fungal nail infections.\u00a0It can take between 6\u00a0and 18 months for the appearance of the affected nail to return to normal, and in some cases the nail may not look the same as before the infection. \n If the treatment is working, you should see a new healthy nail start to grow from the base of nail over the course of a few months. The old infected nail should begin to grow out and can be gradually clipped away. \n Speak to your GP if new, healthy nail doesn't start to grow after a few weeks of treatment. Keep using the treatment until your GP says you can stop, as stopping too early could result in the infection returning. \n Softening and scraping\u00a0away the nail \n As it can take a long time for antifungal\u00a0medication to work, some people may prefer to use a treatment that involves softening and removing infected parts of\u00a0nail over a few weeks. \n Treatment kits are available\u00a0from pharmacies that\u00a0contain a 40% urea paste, plasters\u00a0and a scraping device. The paste softens the infected parts of the nail, allowing them to be scraped away so they can be gradually replaced with healthy nail. \n To use the treatment: \n \n wash the affected\u00a0area and dry it thoroughly \n carefully apply the paste to the\u00a0infected\u00a0nails \n cover the nails with plasters and leave them for 24 hours \n wash the paste off the next day and scrape away the softened parts of the nail \n repeat this process each\u00a0day for 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0weeks \n \n Once no more infected parts of the nail can be removed, ask your pharmacist for antifungal nail paint to prevent re-infection as the nail regrows over\u00a0the next few months. \n Removing the nail \n A procedure to remove affected nails completely isn't usually necessary, but may be recommended if\u00a0the infection is severe or painful and other treatments haven't helped. \n If your nail is surgically removed, a new nail should eventually grow back in its place. However, it could take a year or more for the nail to grow back completely. \n Laser\u00a0treatment \n Laser treatment is a possible option if you have a fungal nail infection that's\u00a0particularly stubborn. The laser emits high doses of light energy, which are used to destroy the fungus. \n Early research suggests the treatment may be helpful in treating fungal nail infections, but there's currently not enough\u00a0evidence to recommend it as a routine treatment. \n If you want to try laser treatment, you'll have to pay for it privately because it's not available on the NHS. Be aware that the treatment may need to be repeated several times for up to a year, so it could get very expensive.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. \n Anyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the\u00a0droplets have landed on\u00a0if\u00a0you\u00a0pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your\u00a0nose or mouth. \n Everyday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with\u00a0the flu virus, including food, door handles, remote controls, handrails, telephone handsets\u00a0and computer keyboards. Therefore, it's important to wash your hands frequently. \n You can catch flu many times\u00a0because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have a natural resistance to the new versions. \n Preventing the spread of flu \n You can help stop yourself catching flu\u00a0or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures. \n Always wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, as well as: \n \n regularly cleaning surfaces\u00a0such as\u00a0your computer keyboard, telephone and door handles\u00a0to get rid of germs \n using tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze \n putting used tissues in a bin as soon as possible \n \n You can also help stop the spread of flu by avoiding unnecessary contact with other people while you're infectious.

Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people\u00a0may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree. \n One of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is\u00a0because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose.

The main symptom is widespread pain. \n There may be periods when your symptoms get better or worse, depending on factors such as: \n \n your stress levels \n changes in the weather \n how physically active you are \n \n If you think you have fibromyalgia, visit your GP. Treatment is available to ease some of the symptoms, although it's unlikely they'll ever disappear completely. \n The main symptoms of fibromyalgia are outlined below. \n Widespread pain \n If you have fibromyalgia, one of the main symptoms is likely to be widespread pain. This may be felt throughout your body, but could be worse in particular areas, such as your back or neck. The pain is likely to be continuous, although it\u00a0may be better or more severe at different times. \n The pain could feel like: \n \n an ache \n a burning sensation \n a sharp, stabbing pain \n \n Extreme sensitivity \n Fibromyalgia can make you extremely sensitive to pain all over your body, and you may find that even the slightest touch is\u00a0painful. If you hurt yourself\u00a0\u2013 such as stubbing your toe\u00a0\u2013 the pain may continue for much longer than it normally would. \n You may hear the condition described in the following medical terms: \n \n hyperalgesia \u2013\u00a0when you're extremely sensitive to pain \n allodynia \u2013\u00a0when you feel pain from something that shouldn't be painful at all, such as a very light touch \n \n You may also\u00a0be sensitive to things such as smoke, certain foods and bright lights. Being exposed to something you're sensitive to can cause your other fibromyalgia symptoms to flare up. \n Stiffness \n Fibromyalgia can make you feel stiff. The stiffness may be most severe when you've been in the same position for a long period of time\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example,\u00a0when you first wake up in the morning. \n It can also cause your muscles to spasm, which is when they contract (squeeze) tightly and painfully. \n Fatigue \n Fibromyalgia can cause fatigue (extreme tiredness). This can range from a mild, tired feeling to the exhaustion often experienced during a flu-like illness. \n Severe fatigue may come on suddenly and can drain you of all your energy. If this happens, you may feel too tired to do anything at all. \n Poor sleep quality \n Fibromyalgia can affect your sleep. You may often wake up tired, even when you've had plenty of sleep. This is because\u00a0the condition\u00a0can sometimes prevent you from sleeping deeply enough to refresh you properly. \n You may hear this described as \"non-restorative sleep\". \n Cognitive problems ('fibro-fog') \n Cognitive problems are issues related to mental processes, such as thinking and learning. If you have fibromyalgia, you may have: \n \n trouble remembering and learning new things \n problems with attention and concentration \n slowed or confused speech \n \n Headaches \n If fibromyalgia has caused you to experience pain and stiffness in your neck and shoulders, you may also have frequent  headaches . \n These can vary from being mild headaches to severe  migraines ,\u00a0and could\u00a0also involve other symptoms, such as nausea (feeling sick). \n Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \n Some people with fibromyalgia also develop\u00a0 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . \n IBS is a common digestive condition that causes pain and bloating in your stomach. It can also lead to\u00a0 constipation  or  diarrhoea . \n Other symptoms \n Other symptoms that people with fibromyalgia sometimes experience include: \n \n dizziness and clumsiness \n feeling too hot or too cold\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is because you're not\u00a0able to regulate your body temperature properly \n  restless legs syndrome \u00a0(an overwhelming urge to move your legs) \n tingling, numbness, prickling or burning sensations in your hands and feet (pins and needles, also known as paraesthesia) \n in women, unusually\u00a0painful periods \n anxiety\u00a0 \n  depression \u00a0 \n \n Depression \n In some cases, having the condition can lead to depression. This is because fibromyalgia\u00a0can be difficult to deal with, and low levels of certain hormones associated with the condition can make you prone to developing depression. \n Depression can cause many symptoms, including: \n \n constantly feeling low \n feeling hopeless and helpless \n losing interest in the things you usually enjoy \n \n If you think you may be depressed, it's important to get help from your GP or your fibromyalgia healthcare professional, if you've been seeing one.", "causes": "It's not clear why some people develop fibromyalgia. The exact cause is unknown, but it's likely that a number of factors are involved. \n Here are some of the main factors thought to contribute to the condition:\u00a0 \n Abnormal pain messages \n One of the main theories is that people with fibromyalgia have developed changes in the way the central nervous system processes the\u00a0pain messages carried around the\u00a0body. This could be due to changes to chemicals in the nervous system. \n The central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and nerves) transmits information all over your body through a network of specialised cells. Changes in the way this system works may explain why fibromyalgia results in constant feelings of, and extreme sensitivity to, pain. \n Chemical imbalances \n Research has found that people\u00a0with fibromyalgia have abnormally low\u00a0levels of the hormones serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine in their brains. \n Low levels of these hormones may be a key factor in the cause of fibromyalgia, as they're important in regulating things such as: \n \n mood \n appetite \n sleep \n behaviour \n your\u00a0response\u00a0to stressful situations \n \n These hormones also play a role in processing pain messages sent\u00a0by the nerves. Increasing the hormone levels with medication can disrupt\u00a0these signals. \n Some researchers have also suggested that changes in the levels of some other hormones, such as cortisol (which is released when the body is under stress), may contribute to fibromyalgia. \n Sleep problems \n It's possible that disturbed sleep patterns may be a cause of fibromyalgia, rather than just a symptom. \n Fibromyalgia can prevent you from sleeping deeply and cause fatigue (extreme tiredness). People with\u00a0the condition\u00a0who sleep badly can also have higher levels of pain, suggesting that these sleep problems contribute to the other symptoms of fibromyalgia. \n Genetics \n Research has suggested that genetics may play a small part in the development of fibromyalgia, with some people perhaps more likely than others to develop the condition because of their genes. \n If this is the case, genetics could explain why\u00a0many people develop fibromyalgia after some sort of trigger. \n Possible triggers \n Fibromyalgia is often triggered by a stressful event, including physical stress or emotional (psychological) stress. Possible triggers for the condition include: \n \n an\u00a0injury \n a viral infection \n giving birth \n having an operation \n the breakdown of a relationship \n being in an abusive relationship \n the death of a loved one \n \n However, in some cases, fibromyalgia doesn't develop after any obvious trigger. \n Associated\u00a0conditions \n There are several other conditions often associated with fibromyalgia. Generally, these are rheumatic conditions (affecting the joints, muscles and bones), such as: \n \n  osteoarthritis  \u2013 when damage to the joints causes\u00a0pain and stiffness \n  lupus  \u2013 when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues in various parts of the body \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \u2013 when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells in the joints, causing pain and swelling \n ankylosing spondylitis \u2013 pain and swelling in parts of the spine \n temporomandibular disorder (TMD) \u2013 a condition that can cause pain in the jaw, cheeks, ears and temples \n \n Conditions such as these\u00a0are usually tested for when\u00a0 diagnosing fibromyalgia .", "treatment": "Treatment for fibromyalgia tries to ease some of your symptoms and improve quality of life, but there's currently no cure. \n Your GP will play an important role in your treatment and care.\u00a0They can\u00a0help you decide what's best for you,\u00a0depending on what you prefer and the available\u00a0treatments. \n In some cases, several different healthcare professionals may also be involved in your care, such as: \n \n a rheumatologist \u2013 a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints \n a neurologist \u2013 a specialist in conditions of the central nervous system \n a psychologist \u2013 a specialist in mental health\u00a0and psychological treatments \n \n Fibromyalgia has numerous symptoms, meaning that no single treatment will work for all of them. Treatments that work for some people won't necessarily work for others. \n You may need to try a variety of treatments to find a combination that suits you. This will normally be a combination of medication and lifestyle changes. \n Information and support \n You may find it helpful to research fibromyalgia to improve your understanding of the condition. Many people also find support groups helpful. Just talking to someone who knows what you're going though can make you feel better. \n You can visit\u00a0 UK Fibromyalgia's support group section  for a list of fibromyalgia support groups across the country. \n  Fibromyalgia Action UK  is a charity that offers information and support to anyone who has fibromyalgia. It has\u00a0a telephone service (0844 887 2444) you can call with any questions about the condition. It also has a network of local\u00a0 support groups \u00a0you may find helpful. \n There's also an\u00a0 online community  where you can find out about news, events and ongoing research. \n Medication \n You may need to take several different types of medicines for fibromyalgia, including painkillers and antidepressants. These are described below. \n Painkillers \n Simple painkillers that are\u00a0available over the counter from a pharmacy, such as  paracetamol , can sometimes help relieve\u00a0the pain associated with fibromyalgia. However, these aren't suitable for everyone, so make sure you\u00a0read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions that come with the medication before using them. \n If over-the-counter painkillers aren't effective, your GP (or another healthcare professional treating you) may prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as\u00a0codeine or tramadol. \n However, these\u00a0painkillers can\u00a0be addictive and their effect tends to weaken over time. This means that your dose may need to be gradually increased and you could experience\u00a0withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them. Other side effects include  diarrhoea \u00a0and fatigue (extreme tiredness). \n Antidepressants \n  Antidepressant medication \u00a0can also help to relieve pain for some people with\u00a0fibromyalgia. They boost the levels of certain chemicals that carry messages to and from the brain, known as neurotransmitters. \n Low levels of\u00a0neurotransmitters may be a factor in fibromyalgia, and it's believed that increasing their levels may ease the widespread pain associated with the condition. \n There are\u00a0different types of antidepressants. The choice of medicine largely depends on\u00a0the severity of your symptoms and any side effects the medicine may cause. \n Antidepressants used to treat fibromyalgia include: \n \n tricyclic antidepressants \u2013 such as amitriptyline \n serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) \u2013 such as duloxetine and\u00a0venlafaxine \n  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  \u2013 such as fluoxetine and paroxetine \n \n A medication called\u00a0pramipexole, which isn't an antidepressant, but also\u00a0affects the levels of neurotransmitters,\u00a0is sometimes used as well. \n Antidepressants can cause a number of side effects, including: \n \n feeling sick \n dry mouth \n drowsiness \n feeling agitated, shaky or anxious \n dizziness \n weight gain \n  constipation  \n \n For information on the side effects of your particular medication, check the patient information leaflet that comes with it. \n Medication to help you sleep \n As fibromyalgia can affect your sleeping patterns, you may want medicine to help you sleep. If you're sleeping better, you may find that other symptoms aren't as severe. \n Speak to your GP if you think you could benefit from\u00a0a medicine like this. They may recommend an over-the-counter remedy, or prescribe a short course of a stronger medication. Some antidepressants may also improve your sleep quality. \n Read more\u00a0about\u00a0 treating insomnia  for information on good sleeping techniques and medicines to help you sleep. \n Muscle relaxants \n If you have muscle stiffness or spasms (when the muscles contract painfully) as a result of fibromyalgia, your GP may prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant, such as diazepam. \n These medicines may also help you sleep better because they can have a sedative (sleep-inducing) effect. \n Anticonvulsants \n You may also be prescribed an anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) medicine, as these can be effective for those with fibromyalgia. \n The most commonly used\u00a0anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia\u00a0are pregabalin\u00a0and gabapentin. These are normally used to treat  epilepsy , but research has shown they can improve the pain associated with fibromyalgia in some people. \n Some common side effects of pregablin and gabapentin include: \n \n dizziness \n drowsiness \n swelling of your hands and feet (oedema) \n weight gain \n \n Antipsychotics \n Antipsychotic medicines, also called neuroleptics, are sometimes used to help relieve long-term pain. Studies have shown that these medications may help conditions such as fibromyalgia, but further research is needed to confirm this. \n Possible side effects include: \n \n drowsiness \n tremors (shaking) \n restlessness \n \n Other treatment options \n As well as medication, there are other treatment options\u00a0that can be used to help cope with the pain of fibromyalgia, such as: \n \n swimming, sitting or exercising in a heated pool or warm water (known as hydrotherapy or balneotherapy) \n an individually tailored exercise programme \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \u2013\u00a0a talking therapy that aims to change the way you think about things, so you can tackle problems more positively \n  psychotherapy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a talking therapy that helps you understand\u00a0and deal with your thoughts and feelings \n relaxation techniques \n psychological support\u00a0\u2013\u00a0any kind of\u00a0counselling\u00a0or support group that helps you deal with issues caused by fibromyalgia\u00a0 \n \n See  self-help for fibromyalgia \u00a0for more information about exercise and relaxation techniques. \n Alternative therapies \n Some people with fibromyalgia try complementary or alternative treatments, such as:\u00a0 \n \n acupuncture \n massage \n manipulation \n aromatherapy \n \n There's little scientific evidence that such treatments help in the long term. However, some people find that certain treatments help them to relax and feel less stressed, allowing them to cope with their condition better. \n Research into some complementary medicines, such as plant extracts, has found they're not effective in treating fibromyalgia. If you decide to use any complementary or herbal remedies, check with your GP first. Some remedies can react unpredictably with other medication, or make it less effective. \n Treating other conditions \n If you've been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and another condition, such as\u00a0 depression  or\u00a0 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , you may need to have separate treatment for these. For example, additional counselling or medication may be recommended.\u00a0 \n Read more about:\u00a0 \n \n  treating depression  \n  treating IBS", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you think you have fibromyalgia, visit your GP. Diagnosing fibromyalgia can be difficult, as there's no specific test to diagnose the condition. \n The\u00a0 symptoms of fibromyalgia  can vary and are similar to those of several other conditions.\u00a0 \n During diagnosis, you'll be asked about how your symptoms are affecting your daily life. Your body will also be examined to check for visible signs of other conditions\u00a0\u2013 for example, swollen joints\u00a0may suggest arthritis, rather than fibromyalgia. \n Ruling out other conditions \n If your GP thinks you may have fibromyalgia, they'll first have to rule out all other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. These conditions may include: \n \n  chronic fatigue syndrome (also known as ME)  \u2013 a condition that causes long-term tiredness \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \u2013 a condition that causes pain and\u00a0swelling in the joints \n  multiple sclerosis (MS)  \u2013 a condition of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) that affects movement and balance \n \n Tests to check for some of these conditions\u00a0include urine and\u00a0 blood tests , although you may also have\u00a0 X-rays  and other scans. If you're found to have another condition, you could still have fibromyalgia as well. \n Criteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia \n For fibromyalgia to be diagnosed, certain criteria usually have to be met. The\u00a0most widely used criteria for diagnosis are: \n \n you either have severe pain in three to six different areas of your body, or you have milder pain in seven or more different areas \n your symptoms have stayed at a similar level for at least three months \n no other reason for your symptoms has been found \n \n The extent of\u00a0the pain used to be assessed by applying gentle pressure to certain \"tender points\", where any pain\u00a0is likely to be at its worst. However, this is\u00a0less common nowadays. \n Diagnosing other conditions \n It's also possible to have other conditions alongside your fibromyalgia, such as: \n \n  depression  \n  anxiety  \n  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  \n \n If your symptoms suggest that you have another condition as well as fibromyalgia, you may need further tests to diagnose these. Identifying all possible conditions will help to guide your treatment."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Fever in children", "introduction": "A fever is a high temperature. As a general rule, in children a temperature of over 37.5C (99.5F) is a fever. \n As a parent it can be extremely worrying if your child has a high temperature. However, it's very common and often clears up by itself\u00a0without treatment.\u00a0 \n A quick and easy way to\u00a0find out whether your child has a\u00a0fever is to take their temperature using a thermometer. \n What causes a high temperature? \n Most fevers are caused by infections or other illnesses.\u00a0The high body temperature\u00a0makes it more difficult for the\u00a0bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive. \n Common conditions that can cause fevers include: \n \n upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs) \n  flu  \n ear infections \n roseola\u00a0\u2013 a virus that causes a temperature and a\u00a0rash\u00a0 \n  tonsillitis  \n kidney or\u00a0 urinary tract infections (UTIs)  \n common childhood illnesses, such as  chickenpox  and  whooping cough  \n \n Your child's temperature can also be raised after vaccinations, or if they overheat because of too much bedding or clothing. \n When to seek urgent medical advice \n Contact your GP or health visitor urgently if your child: \n \n is under\u00a0three months old and has a temperature of 38C (101F) or above \n is between three and six months old and has a temperature of 39C (102F) or above \n \n You should also see your GP if your child has other signs of being unwell, such as persistent vomiting, refusal to feed, floppiness\u00a0or drowsiness. \n If\u00a0it isn't\u00a0possible to contact your GP,\u00a0call your local\u00a0out-of-hours service or phone the\u00a0NHS 24 111 service. \n If your child seems to be otherwise well\u00a0\u2013 for example, if they're playing and attentive \u2013\u00a0it's less likely they're seriously ill.\u00a0 \n Treating a fever \n If your child has a fever, it's\u00a0important to keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of cool water to drink. \n Babies should be given plenty of liquids, such as breast milk or formula.\u00a0Even if your child isn't thirsty, try to get them to drink little and often to keep their fluid levels up. \n If the environment is warm,\u00a0you could\u00a0help to your child to stay at a comfortable temperature by covering them with a lightweight sheet or opening a window. \n However, they should still be appropriately dressed for their surroundings and sponging your child with cool\u00a0water\u00a0isn't recommended\u00a0to reduce a fever. \n Antipyretics \n Children's  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen \u00a0work as antipyretics, which\u00a0help to reduce fever, as well as being painkillers.\u00a0You can't give them both at the same time, but if one doesn't work, you may want to try the other later. \n Antipyretics aren't always necessary. If your child isn't distressed by the fever or underlying illness, there's no need to use antipyretics to reduce a fever. \n When using antipyretics, always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication to find the correct dose and frequency for your child's age. \n More serious illnesses \n Sometimes a high\u00a0temperature in children is associated with more serious signs and symptoms, such as: \n \n  breathlessness  \n vomiting\u00a0 \n  rash \u00a0 \n  fits or seizures \u00a0 \n \n Possible serious bacterial illnesses include: \n \n  meningitis \u00a0\u2013 infection of the meninges, the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord \n  septicaemia  \u2013 infection of the blood \n  pneumonia \u00a0\u2013 inflammation of the lung tissue, usually caused by an infection \n \n It's\u00a0important to remember that\u00a0potentially serious causes of fever are relatively rare.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Flatulence", "introduction": "Flatulence is passing gas from the digestive system out of the back passage. It's more commonly known as \"passing wind\", or \"farting\". \n Farting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with\u00a0changes to your diet and lifestyle. \n Flatulence is\u00a0a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about\u00a05 to 15 times a day. \n Why\u00a0it happens \n When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by\u00a0farting (flatulence) or\u00a0burping (belching). \n Sometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit. \n Excessive\u00a0flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or\u00a0eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be\u00a0related to\u00a0an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring  indigestion  or  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . \n Read more about the  causes of flatulence . \n When to see your GP \n There are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms. \n See your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas. \n You should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as: \n \n persistent\u00a0 abdominal pain  and bloating \n recurring episodes of\u00a0 diarrhoea  or\u00a0 constipation  \n unexplained weight loss \n  bowel incontinence \u00a0 \n blood in your stools\u00a0(faeces) \n signs of an infection,\u00a0such as a high temperature, vomiting, chills,\u00a0joint pain and muscle pain \n \n These symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may\u00a0require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection. \n Controlling the problem \n Excessive\u00a0flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as: \n \n avoiding foods known to cause flatulence \n eating smaller and more frequent meals \n eating and drinking slowly \n exercising regularly \n \n There are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone. \n If your flatulence is related to an underlying health problem, treating the condition may help\u00a0resolve it. \n Read more about  treating flatulence .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "There are several natural causes of flatulence. Flatulence can also be caused by some health conditions related to the digestive system, or as a side effect of certain medicines. \n Swallowing air \n It's perfectly normal to swallow air while breathing and eating. However, it's easy to swallow a lot more air than usual without realising it. This can cause excessive flatulence. \n Excess air can be swallowed by: \n \n chewing gum \n smoking \n sucking on pen tops or hard sweets \n having loose-fitting dentures \n not chewing food slowly and thoroughly\u00a0\u2013 swallowing large pieces of food causes you to swallow more air \n \n Hot and fizzy drinks also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your stomach, although this is more likely to cause belching rather than flatulence. \n Food and drink \n Some carbohydrates in food\u00a0can't be digested and absorbed by the intestines.\u00a0These pass down into your colon to be broken down by bacteria, producing gas, which is released as flatulence. \n Foods containing a high amount of unabsorbable carbohydrates include: \n \n beans \n broccoli \n cabbage \n cauliflower \n artichokes \n raisins \n pulses \n lentils \n onions \n prunes \n apples \n Brussels sprouts \n \n Foods containing a lot of unrefined cereal fibre, such as bran, can also sometimes cause problems with wind and bloating. \n Other foods and drinks that contain a sweetener called sorbitol\u00a0(such as sugar-free gum or slimming products) or a\u00a0type of sugar called fructose (such as fruit juice)\u00a0can also cause flatulence. This means chewing sugar-free gum can cause flatulence from both the sweetener and\u00a0swallowing\u00a0air. \n Certain foods, such as cabbage or onions, can lead to the production of gases containing sulphur, which can result in foul-smelling wind. However, the production of smelly wind can vary from person to person depending on what you eat, so it's up to you to work out which foods cause the most smell. \n Health conditions \n Certain health conditions can cause symptoms of flatulence, including: \n \n  indigestion  \n  constipation \u00a0 \n  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a common digestive condition, which\u00a0can cause stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation \n  coeliac disease \u00a0\u2013 an intolerance to a protein called gluten, found in wheat, rye and barley \n  lactose intolerance \u00a0\u2013 where the body is unable to break down lactose (a natural sugar found in milk and dairy products) and can't absorb it into the blood \n  gastroenteritis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a stomach and bowel infection \n malabsorption\u00a0\u2013 where the intestines are unable to absorb nutrients properly \n giardiasis\u00a0\u2013 an infection of the digestive system\u00a0caused by tiny parasites \n \n Medicine \n Flatulence, often caused by  indigestion ,\u00a0is a possible side effect of many types of medicine, including: \n \n  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen  \n some  laxatives  \n antifungal medicines \n  statins  \n varenicline (Champix)\u00a0\u2013 used to help people stop smoking", "treatment": "Excessive flatulence can usually be treated by making changes to your diet and lifestyle. \n Several over-the-counter treatments are also available if your flatulence is becoming a problem. \n Self care advice \n Diet \n You should try to avoid eating foods high in unabsorbable carbohydrates. For a list of these foods, see  causes of flatulence . Certain processed foods should also be avoided as they can contain ingredients that cause flatulence, including: \n \n any foods with artifical sweeteners \n sugar-free sweets or chewing gum \n fizzy drinks \n \n However, it's still important to eat a  healthy balanced diet , including at least 5\u00a0portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Choose foods containing carbohydrates that are easy to digest. These include: \n \n potatoes \n rice \n lettuce \n bananas \n grapes \n citrus fruits, such as oranges \n yoghurt \n \n It's important to note that\u00a0people react differently to certain foods, so some foods listed above may still cause flatulence. You may\u00a0find it useful\u00a0to keep a food diary to see whether certain foods make your symptoms better or worse. \n You may also find it useful to eat 6\u00a0small meals a day rather than 3\u00a0large ones. Smaller meals are easier to digest and may produce less gas. \n There's some evidence to suggest drinking peppermint tea can help improve the symptoms of flatulence. There's also some evidence that small amounts of ginger can help with digestion or an upset stomach, which may be causing flatulence. However, pregnant women should consult their doctor before taking ginger. \n Swallowing air \n When eating, make sure you chew\u00a0food slowly to reduce the amount of air you swallow. This will also help with digestion. Avoid chewing gum as it can also cause you to swallow more air than usual. \n You should also give up smoking, if you smoke. Smoking can cause you to swallow more air than usual, and tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system.\u00a0See\u00a0 stop\u00a0smoking \u00a0for more information and advice about quitting smoking. \n Exercise \n Getting plenty of exercise can help improve the functioning of your digestive system and bowel. It has also been shown to help with bloating and the passage of gas. \n Medications and other remedies \n There are\u00a0several over-the-counter remedies that can help treat the symptoms of flatulence, some of which are described below. \n Charcoal tablets \n Charcoal tablets\u00a0are a type of medication available over the counter from pharmacists. The charcoal absorbs gas in the digestive system, which helps\u00a0reduce symptoms. \n Charcoal tablets may not be suitable for you if you are currently taking other medication. This is because the charcoal might absorb the medication and make it less effective. If you are taking other medication, ask your GP or pharmacist for advice before taking charcoal tablets. \n Clothing containing activated charcoal, or charcoal pads placed inside clothing,\u00a0can help absorb foul-smelling gas released during flatulence. These\u00a0products can be\u00a0purchased online. \n Simethicone is another over-the-counter medication that can also sometimes help with gas problems. \n Dietary supplements \n Alpha-galactosidase is a dietary supplement that may help improve the digestion of carbohydrates and reduce\u00a0symptoms of flatulence. It's found in a product called Beano, which has been shown to have some effect in reducing flatulence and is available from some pharmacists and health food shops. \n Probiotics may also be useful in treating flatulence. Probiotics are a dietary supplement, usually sold in liquid or capsule form, which encourages the growth of \"friendly bacteria\" in your digestive system. \n The \"friendly bacteria\" should help digestion and reduce the symptoms of flatulence, particularly in\u00a0people with  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . Probiotic yoghurts may also help, but avoid those with artificial sweeteners or added fibre.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Fibroids", "introduction": "Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or around the womb (uterus). \n The growths are made up of muscle and fibrous tissue and vary in size. They're sometimes known as uterine myomas or leiomyomas. \n Many women are unaware they have fibroids because they don't have any symptoms. Women who do have\u00a0symptoms (around one in three) may experience: \n \n heavy periods or painful periods \n tummy (abdominal) pain \n lower\u00a0 back pain  \n a frequent need to urinate \n  constipation  \n pain or discomfort during sex \n \n In rare cases, further\u00a0 complications caused by fibroids \u00a0can affect pregnancy or cause  infertility . \n Seeing your GP \n As fibroids don't often cause symptoms, they're sometimes diagnosed by chance during a routine gynaecological examination, test or scan. \n However, see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of fibroids so they can investigate possible causes. \n If your GP thinks you may have fibroids, they'll usually refer you for an  ultrasound scan  to confirm the diagnosis. \n Read more about  diagnosing fibroids  \n Why fibroids\u00a0develop \n The exact cause of fibroids is unknown. However,\u00a0they're linked to the hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen is the female reproductive hormone produced by the ovaries (the female reproductive organs). \n Fibroids usually develop during a woman's reproductive years (from around 16 to 50 years of age) when oestrogen levels are at their highest. They tend to shrink when oestrogen levels are low, such as after the  menopause  (when a woman's monthly periods\u00a0stop). \n Who gets fibroids? \n Fibroids are common, with around 1 in 3 women developing them at some\u00a0point in their life. They most often occur in women aged 30-50. \n Fibroids\u00a0are thought to develop\u00a0more frequently\u00a0in\u00a0women of African- Caribbean origin. It's also thought they occur more often\u00a0in overweight or\u00a0 obese  women because\u00a0being overweight increases the level of oestrogen in the body. \n Women who've had children have a lower risk of developing fibroids, and the risk decreases further the more children you have. \n Types of fibroids \n Fibroids can grow anywhere in the womb and vary in size considerably. Some\u00a0can be\u00a0the size of a pea, whereas others can be the size of a melon. \n The main types of fibroids are: \n \n intramural fibroids \u2013 the most common type of fibroid, which develop in the muscle wall of the womb \n subserosal fibroids \u2013 fibroids that\u00a0develop outside the wall of the womb into the pelvis and can become very large \n submucosal fibroids \u2013 fibroids that develop in the muscle layer beneath the womb's inner lining and grow into the cavity of the womb \n \n In some cases, subserosal or submucosal fibroids\u00a0are attached to the womb with\u00a0a narrow stalk of tissue. These are known as pedunculated fibroids. \n Treating fibroids \n Treatment for fibroids isn't needed if they aren't causing symptoms. Over time, fibroids will often shrink and disappear without treatment, particularly after the menopause. \n If you do have symptoms caused by fibroids, medication to help relieve the symptoms will\u00a0usually be recommended first. \n There are also medications\u00a0available to help shrink fibroids. If these prove ineffective, surgery or\u00a0other less invasive procedures may be recommended. \n Read more about  treating fibroids", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Treatment may not be necessary if you have fibroids but don't have any symptoms, or if you only have minor symptoms that aren't significantly affecting your everyday activities. \n Fibroids often shrink after the  menopause , and your symptoms will usually either ease or disappear completely. \n If you have fibroids that need treatment, your GP may recommend medication to help relieve your symptoms. However, you may need to see a gynaecologist (specialist in the female reproductive system) for further medication or surgery if these are ineffective. See your GP to discuss the best treatment plan for you. \n The various treatments for fibroids are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Medication for symptoms \n Medicines are available that can be used to\u00a0reduce heavy periods, but they can be less effective the larger your fibroids are.

It stops your womb lining growing quickly, so it's thinner and your bleeding becomes lighter. \n Side effects associated with LNG-IUS include: \n \n irregular bleeding that may last for more than six months \n  acne  \n  headaches  \n breast tenderness \n in some cases, no\u00a0periods at all ( absent periods ) \n \n LNG-IUS\u00a0also acts as a contraceptive, but doesn't affect your chances of getting pregnant after you stop using\u00a0it.\u00a0 \n Tranexamic acid \n If LNG-IUS is unsuitable\u00a0\u2013 for example, if\u00a0 contraception  isn't desired\u00a0\u2013 tranexamic acid tablets may be considered. They work by stopping the small blood vessels in the womb lining bleeding, reducing blood loss by about 50%. \n Tranexamic acid tablets are taken three or four times a day\u00a0during your period for up to four days.\u00a0Treatment should be stopped if your symptoms haven't improved within three months. \n Tranexamic acid tablets aren't a form of contraception and won't affect your chances of becoming pregnant. \n  Indigestion \u00a0and  diarrhoea \u00a0are two possible side effects of tranexamic acid tablets.\u00a0 \n Anti-inflammatory medicines \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen  and mefenamic acid,\u00a0can be taken three times a day\u00a0from the first day of\u00a0your period until bleeding stops or reduces to manageable levels. \n NSAIDs work by reducing your body's production of a hormone-like substance called prostaglandin, which is linked to heavy periods. \n Anti-inflammatory medicines are also painkillers, but they\u00a0aren't a form of contraception. \n Indigestion and diarrhoea are common side effects of NSAIDs. \n The contraceptive pill \n The\u00a0 contraceptive pill  is a popular method of contraception that stops an egg being released from the ovaries to prevent pregnancy. \n As well as making bleeding lighter, some contraceptive pills can help reduce  period pain . \n Your GP can provide you with further advice about contraception and the contraceptive pill. \n Oral progestogen\u00a0 \n Oral progestogen is synthetic (man-made) progesterone (one of the female sex hormones) that\u00a0can help reduce heavy periods. It's usually taken as a daily tablet from\u00a0days five to 26 of your menstrual cycle, counting the first day of your period as day one. \n Oral progestogen works by preventing the womb lining growing quickly. It's not a form of contraception, but it\u00a0can reduce your chances of conceiving while you're taking it. \n The side effects of\u00a0oral progestogen can\u00a0be unpleasant and include weight gain, breast tenderness and short-term acne. \n Injected progestogen \n Progestogen is also available as an injection to treat heavy periods. It works by preventing the lining of your womb growing quickly. \n This form of progestogen can be injected once every 12 weeks for as long as treatment is required. \n Common side effects of injected progestogen include: \n \n weight gain \n irregular bleeding \n absent periods \n premenstrual symptoms, such as bloating, fluid retention and breast tenderness \n \n Injected progestogen\u00a0also acts as a\u00a0contraceptive. It doesn't prevent you becoming pregnant after you stop using it, although there may be a significant delay (up to 12 months) after you stop taking it before you're able to get pregnant. \n Medication to shrink fibroids \n Gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) \n If you're still experiencing\u00a0symptoms related to fibroids despite treatment with the above medications, your GP\u00a0can refer you to a gynaecologist. They may prescribe medication called gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) to help shrink your fibroids. \n GnRHas, such as\u00a0goserelin acetate, are hormones that are given by injection. They work by affecting the\u00a0pituitary gland which stops the ovaries producing oestrogen. The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the bottom of the brain. It controls a number of important hormone glands within the body. \n GnRHas stop your menstrual cycle (period), but\u00a0aren't a form of contraception.\u00a0They don't affect your chances of becoming pregnant\u00a0after you stop using them.\u00a0 \n If you're prescribed GnRHas,\u00a0they can help ease\u00a0heavy periods and any pressure that you feel on your stomach.\u00a0They also help improve symptoms of frequent urination and  constipation . \n GnRHas are sometimes also used to shrink fibroids prior to surgery to remove them. \n GnRHas can cause a number of menopause-like side effects, including: \n \n hot flushes \n increased sweating \n muscle stiffness \n vaginal dryness \n \n Sometimes, a combination of GnRHas and low doses of  hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  may be recommended to prevent these side effects. \n  Osteoporosis  (thinning of the bones) is an occasional side effect of taking GnRHas. Your GP can give you more information about this and may prescribe additional medication to minimise thinning of your bones. \n GnRHas\u00a0is only prescribed on a short-term basis (a maximum of six months at a time). Your fibroids may grow back to their original size after treatment is stopped. \n Ulipristal acetate \n Ulipristal acetate is a new method of treating fibroids that have moderate to severe symptoms. It\u2019s only recommended for women over 18 years of age. \n The treatment involves taking one tablet orally (by mouth) once a day, with a course of treatment lasting up to three months. During this time you shouldn't bleed and your fibroids will shrink. \n After the initial course of treatment, you wait to see what your first two periods are like while not taking treatment. If they're still heavy, another three month course of ulipristal acetate may be recommended. The need for surgery may be avoided altogether. \n Treatment should only be started when menstruation (monthly periods) have occurred. The first course of treatment should start during the first week of menstruation. Your doctor will be able to explain how long the intervals between treatment courses should be. \n If you\u2019re taking a course of ulipristal acetate and you miss a dose, you should take a dose as soon as possible. However, if the dose was missed by more than 12 hours, you shouldn't take the missed dose but should return to your normal dosing schedule. \n Hormonal forms of  contraception , such as the  progestogen-only pill , the  intrauterine device , or combined oral contraceptive pill\u00a0aren't recommended if you're taking ulipristal acetate. Instead, you should use a barrier method of contraception, such as  condoms . \n The\u00a0 electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC)  website has more information about  ulipristal acetate . \n Surgery \n Surgery to remove your fibroids may be considered if your symptoms are particularly severe and medication has been ineffective. \n Several different procedures can be used to treat fibroids. Your GP will refer you to a specialist who will discuss the options with you, including benefits and any associated risks. \n The main surgical procedures used to treat fibroids are outlined below. \n Hysterectomy \n A\u00a0 hysterectomy  is a surgical procedure to remove the womb. It's the most effective way\u00a0of preventing fibroids coming back. \n A\u00a0hysterectomy may be recommended if you have large fibroids or severe bleeding and you\u00a0don't wish to have any more children. \n There are a number of different ways a hysterectomy can be carried out, including through the vagina or through a number of small incisions in your abdomen (tummy). \n Depending on the technique used, a hysterectomy can be carried out using a spinal or\u00a0epidural anaesthetic\u00a0(where the lower parts of the body are numbed). Sometimes, a  general anaesthetic  may be used, where you'll be asleep during the procedure. \n You'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few days after having a hysterectomy.\u00a0It takes about\u00a0six to eight weeks to fully recover, during which time you should rest as much as possible. \n Side effects of a hysterectomy can include early menopause\u00a0and a\u00a0 loss of libido  (sex drive). However, loss of sex drive usually only occurs if the ovaries have been removed. \n Myomectomy \n A myomectomy is surgery to remove the fibroids from the wall of your womb. It may be considered as an alternative to a hysterectomy if you still would like to have children. \n However,\u00a0a myomectomy\u00a0isn't\u00a0suitable for all types of fibroid. Your gynaecologist can tell you whether the procedure is suitable for you based on factors such as the size, number and position of your fibroids. \n Depending on the size and position of your fibroids, a myomectomy may involve making either a number of small incisions (cuts) in your tummy (keyhole surgery) or a single larger incision (open surgery). \n Myomectomies are carried out under general anaesthetic, and you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few days afterwards.\u00a0After having a myomectomy, you'll be advised to rest for several weeks while you recover. \n Myomectomies are usually an effective treatment for fibroids, although there's a chance the fibroids will grow back and further surgery will be needed. \n Hysteroscopic resection of fibroids \n A hysteroscopic resection of fibroids is a procedure where a thin telescope (hysteroscope) and small surgical instruments are used to remove fibroids. \n The procedure\u00a0can be used to remove fibroids from\u00a0inside the womb (submucosal fibroids), and\u00a0is suitable for women who want to have children in the future. \n No incisions are needed because the hysteroscope is inserted\u00a0through the vagina and into the womb through the entrance to the womb (cervix).\u00a0A number of\u00a0insertions are needed\u00a0to ensure that as much fibroid tissue as possible is removed. \n The procedure is often carried out under general anaesthetic, although local anaesthetic may also be used. You can usually go home on the same day as the procedure. \n After the procedure you may experience stomach cramps, but they should only last a few hours. There may also be a small amount of vaginal bleeding, which should stop within a few weeks. \n Hysteroscopic morcellation of fibroids \n Hysteroscopic morcellation of fibroids is a new procedure where a clinician who's received\u00a0specialist training in the technique uses a hysteroscope and small surgical instruments to remove fibroids. \n The hysteroscope is inserted into the womb through the cervix (neck of the womb), and a specially designed instrument called a morcellator is used to cut away and remove the fibroid tissue. The procedure is carried out under a general or spinal anaesthetic. You'll usually be able to go home on the same day. \n The main benefit of\u00a0hysteroscopic morcellation compared with hysteroscopic resection is that the hysteroscope is only inserted once, rather than a number of times, reducing the risk of injury to the womb. \n The\u00a0procedure may be an option in cases where there are serious complications. However, because\u00a0hysteroscopic morcellation is a new technique, evidence about its overall safety and long-term effectiveness\u00a0is limited. \n Read\u00a0the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  guidance about\u00a0 hysteroscopic morcellation of uterine fibroids (PDF, 133kb) . \n Non-surgical procedures \n As well as traditional surgical techniques to treat fibroids,\u00a0non-surgical treatments are also available. These are outlined below. \n Uterine artery embolisation (UAE) \n Uterine artery embolisation (UAE) is an alternative procedure to a hysterectomy\u00a0or myomectomy for treating fibroids. It may be recommended for women with large fibroids. \n UAE is carried out\u00a0by a radiologist (a specialist doctor who interprets  X-rays  and scans). It\u00a0involves blocking the blood vessels that supply\u00a0the fibroids, causing them to shrink. \n During the procedure, a special solution is injected through a small tube (catheter), which\u00a0is guided by X-ray through a blood vessel in your leg. It's carried out under local anaesthetic, so you'll be awake but the area being treated will be numbed. \n You'll usually need to stay in hospital a day or two after having UAE. When you leave hospital, you'll be advised to rest for one to two weeks. \n Although it's possible to have a successful pregnancy after having UAE, the overall effects of the procedure on fertility and pregnancy are uncertain. It should therefore only be carried out after you've\u00a0discussed the potential risks, benefits and uncertainties\u00a0with your doctor. \n Endometrial ablation \n Endometrial ablation is\u00a0a relatively minor procedure that involves removing the lining of the womb. It's mainly used to reduce heavy bleeding in women without fibroids, but it can also be used to treat small fibroids in the womb lining. \n The affected womb lining can be removed in a number of ways\u00a0\u2013 for example,\u00a0by using laser energy, a heated wire loop, or hot fluid in a balloon. \n The procedure can be carried out either under local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic. It's fairly quick to perform, taking around 20 minutes, and you can usually go home the same day. \n You may experience some vaginal bleeding and tummy cramps\u00a0for a few days afterwards, although some women have bloody discharge for three or four weeks. \n Some women have reported experiencing more severe or prolonged pain after having endometrial ablation. In this case, you should speak to your GP or a member of your hospital care team who may be able to prescribe a stronger painkiller. \n It may still be possible to get pregnant after having endometrial ablation, but the procedure isn't recommended for women who want to have more children because the risk of serious problems, such as  miscarriage , is high. \n The\u00a0 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) \u00a0have more information about endometrial ablation. See their leaflet called  Information for you after an endometrial ablation (PDF, 3.75Mb) . \n MRI-guided procedures \n There are also two relatively new techniques for treating fibroids that use  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . They are: \n \n MRI-guided percutaneous laser ablation \n MRI-guided transcutaneous focused ultrasound \n \n These techniques use MRI to guide small needles into the centre of the fibroid being targeted. Laser energy or ultrasound energy is passed through the needles to destroy the fibroid. \n These treatment methods can't be used to treat all types of fibroids, and\u00a0the long-term benefits and risks are unknown. As these procedures are relatively new, they're not yet widely available in the UK. \n Research is still being carried out, but there's some evidence to suggest that these\u00a0non-invasive procedures have short- to medium-term benefits when performed by an experienced clinician. \n However, the effects on pregnancy and women who want to have a baby in the future aren't fully known, so this should be taken into consideration. \n For further information, read the NICE guidance about: \n \n  MRI-guided percutaneous laser ablation\u00a0for uterine fibroids (PDF, 88.6kb)  \n  MRI-guided transcutaneous focused ultrasound\u00a0for uterine fibroids (PDF, 96kb)", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If your GP suspects fibroids, they'll usually carry out a pelvic examination to look for any obvious signs. \n They may also refer you to a local hospital for further tests outlined below to confirm a diagnosis or rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. \n Sometimes fibroids are only\u00a0discovered during routine gynaecological (vaginal) examinations or tests for other problems, because they often don't cause any symptoms. \n Ultrasound scan \n One of the main tests carried out to diagnose fibroids is an  ultrasound scan . This is a painless scan\u00a0that uses a probe to produce high frequency sound waves\u00a0to create an image of the inside of\u00a0your body. \n Two types of ultrasound scan can be used to help diagnose fibroids: \n \n an abdominal ultrasound scan \u2013 where the ultrasound probe is\u00a0moved\u00a0over the outside of your tummy (abdomen) \n a transvaginal ultrasound scan \u2013 where a small ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina \n \n Images produced by these scans are transmitted to a monitor so your doctor can see if there are any signs of fibroids. \n If an ultrasound scan suggests you have fibroids, you\u00a0may be referred\u00a0to a gynaecologist (a specialist in the female reproductive system) for the tests described below. \n Hysteroscopy \n A hysteroscopy\u00a0is where a\u00a0small telescope (hysteroscope) is inserted into your womb through the vagina and cervix, so your doctor\u00a0can examine the inside of\u00a0your womb. It takes about five minutes to carry out. \n A  local anaesthetic  or  general anaesthetic \u00a0may be used\u00a0so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. However, most women don't need anaesthetic. Some women experience cramping during the procedure. \n A hysteroscopy\u00a0is most often used to look for fibroids within your womb (submucosal fibroids). \n Laparoscopy \n A laparoscope is a small telescope with a light source and camera at one end. The camera relays images of the inside of\u00a0the abdomen or pelvis to a television monitor. \n During a laparoscopy, a\u00a0surgeon will make a\u00a0small incision in\u00a0your abdomen. The laparoscope will be passed into your abdomen to allow the organs and tissues inside your abdomen or pelvis to be examined. General anaesthetic is used,\u00a0so you'll be asleep during the procedure. \n A laparoscopy can be used to look for fibroids outside your womb (subserosal fibroids) or fibroids in the layer of\u00a0muscle surrounding the womb (intramural fibroids) that have affected its size and shape. \n Biopsy \n In some cases, a small tissue sample\u00a0( biopsy )\u00a0may be removed during a hysteroscopy or laparoscopy for closer examination under a microscope."},

However, it's important to get the symptoms\u00a0checked by a doctor as soon as possible. \n Melanoma of the eye \n Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most\u00a0melanomas develop in the skin, but it's also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye. \n Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it\u00a0uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected. \n It\u00a0can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin\u00a0layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid. \n What causes eye melanoma? \n Eye melanoma occurs when\u00a0the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. \n It's not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening: \n \n lighter eye colour \u2013 if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared\u00a0with people who have brown eyes \n white or pale skin \u2013 eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in\u00a0those with fair skin \n unusual moles \u2013 if you have\u00a0irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you're more at risk of developing  skin cancer  and eye melanoma \n use of sunbeds \u2013\u00a0there's some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma \n overexposure to sunlight \u2013 this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma \n \n The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their 50s. \n Read about the  risk factors for other types of eye cancer \u00a0on the Cancer Research UK website. \n Diagnosing melanoma of the eye \n If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects\u00a0you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist\u00a0for an assessment. \n If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they'll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are four centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow. \n It's likely you'll have a number of different tests at the centre, including: \n \n an eye examination \u2013\u00a0to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities \n an  ultrasound scan  of your eye \u2013\u00a0a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows\u00a0your doctor to\u00a0find\u00a0out more about the position of the tumour and its size \n a\u00a0fluorescein angiogram \u2013 where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour \n \n Occasionally,\u00a0a thin needle\u00a0may be\u00a0used to remove a small sample\u00a0of cells from\u00a0the\u00a0tumour  (biopsy) .\u00a0The genetic information in these cells is analysed to\u00a0give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back. \n Treatments for\u00a0eye melanoma \n Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications. \n Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible. \n The main treatments for eye melanoma are: \n \n brachytherapy \u2013\u00a0tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near\u00a0the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells \n external  radiotherapy \u00a0\u2013 a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells \n surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye \u2013 this may be possible if\u00a0the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye \n removal of the eye (enucleation) \u2013 this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you've lost your vision;\u00a0the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches\u00a0your other eye \n \n  Chemotherapy  is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer. \n The\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the  treatment options for eye cancer  and the  types of eye cancer surgery . \n Outlook for eye melanoma \n The outlook for melanoma of the eye depends on how\u00a0big the cancer is at the time it's diagnosed and exactly which parts of the eye are affected. \n Overall: \n \n about 8 out of every 10 people (80%) diagnosed with a small eye melanoma will live for at least five years after diagnosis \n about 7 out of every 10 people (70%) diagnosed with a medium-sized eye melanoma will live for at least five years after diagnosis \n about\u00a05\u00a0out of\u00a0every 10 people (50%) diagnosed with a large eye melanoma will live for at least five years after diagnosis \n \n The\u00a0Cancer Research UK website has more information about the  stages of\u00a0eye cancer \u00a0and\u00a0 statistics and outlook for eye cancer .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ewing sarcoma: Children", "introduction": "Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer in children and young people. This information describes Ewing sarcoma, its symptoms, diagnosis and possible treatments. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are now new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has, and the treatments that may be used, can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Sarcomas \n Sarcomas are rare types of cancer that develop in the supporting tissues of the body. There are two main types: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas. \n Bone sarcomas can develop in any of the bones of the skeleton, but may also develop in the soft tissue near bones. \n Soft tissue sarcomas can develop in muscle, fat, blood vessels or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. \n Ewing sarcoma \n Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary sarcoma in children and young people. This type of cancer is a bone cancer and most commonly occurs in the long bones, ribs, pelvis and spine (vertebral column). \n Fewer than 30 children in the UK develop Ewing sarcoma each year. It usually occurs in the teenage years, and is more common in boys. \n Although Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer, it can also occur very rarely in the soft tissues. This is called extraosseous Ewing sarcoma. Another type of Ewing sarcoma is a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET). These can be found in either the bone or soft tissue. \n Causes \n The exact causes of primary bone cancer are unknown. The development of Ewing sarcoma may be related in some way to times of rapid bone growth, which may explain why more cases are seen in teenagers. Like other cancers, it\u2019s not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people. \n Signs and symptoms \n Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. It is frequently worse at night. However, symptoms may vary depending on the position and size of the cancer. There may be some swelling in the affected area if the tumour is close to the surface of the body and it may become tender to touch. This may cause a limp if in the leg or pelvis. Bone cancer is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the child has a minor fall or accident. Occasionally, there may be fever or weight loss. \n How Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed \n Usually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or x rays. If a sarcoma is suspected, your GP should refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre. A variety of tests and investigations are needed to diagnose Ewing sarcoma, including an x-ray of the painful part of the bone, a chest x-ray and a blood test. A specialist doctor will remove a small piece of the tumour to look at under a microscope (biopsy). Other tests may be done, such as a bone scan, PET scan, a bone marrow biopsy; an MRI or CT scan may also be done. \n Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you. \n Treatment \n A combination of various treatments is used to treat Ewing sarcoma. These include chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the size and position of the tumour. \n  Chemotherapy  \n Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. \n This is a very important component of treatment for the majority of children with Ewing sarcoma and can help make surgery more straightforward. A combination of different chemotherapy drugs are given before surgery and continued afterwards in order to destroy any remaining cancer cells and prevent the sarcoma from spreading. Chemotherapy given in this way is called adjuvant chemotherapy. \n  Surgery  \n If surgery is needed, it should be carried out at a specialist orthopaedic bone tumour centre. The aim of surgery is to remove the tumour without causing too much damage. If the tumour is in one of the main bones of the arm or leg, however, it may be necessary to remove the whole limb (amputation) or part of the affected bone. If only part of the affected bone is removed, this is known as limb-sparing surgery. \n  Amputation  \n Sometimes amputation of the limb is unavoidable if the cancer has affected the surrounding blood vessels and nerves. After amputation, a false limb will be fitted, and this will be regularly adjusted as your child grows. False limbs work very well. It should be possible for your child to join in with normal activities and even sport. \n  Limb-sparing surgery  \n There are several ways in which limb-sparing surgery may be done. It may involve: \n \n replacing the bone with a prosthesis (a specially designed artificial part) \n replacing the bone with bone taken from another part of the body (a bone graft) \n \n After limb-sparing surgery, the child is often able to use the limb almost normally. However, it is best not to take part in any contact sports, because any damage to the bone graft or prosthesis may require another major operation to repair or replace it. If the child is growing, the limb prosthesis will need to be lengthened from time to time as the bone grows. This may mean further short stays in hospital, although some prostheses can be lengthened during an outpatient procedure. \n  Radiotherapy  \n Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays that destroy cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. Ewing sarcoma responds very well to radiotherapy. It is often used after chemotherapy and before or after surgery. If the tumour is impossible to remove surgically, it is a good option. \n Side effects of treatment for Ewing sarcoma \n Treatment often causes  side effects . Your child\u2019s doctor will discuss this with you before the treatment starts. Any possible side effects will depend on the actual treatment being used and the part of the body that\u2019s being treated. \n Side effects can include: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n  hair loss  \n increased risk of infection \n bruising and bleeding \n  tiredness  \n diarrhoea \n \n  Radiotherapy  can cause irritation or soreness of the skin in the area being treated and general tiredness. If your child is having surgery, the surgeon will explain the possible complications of the surgery that your child is having. \n Late side effects \n A small number of children may develop other side effects, sometimes many years later. These include a reduction in normal bone growth, reduced fertility, a change in heart function, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer later in life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will explain all of this to you and will monitor your child carefully for any potential late side effects. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children\u2019s cancers. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information will be provided to help explain things. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Your child will have regular follow-up appointments, with x-rays or scans as necessary. Many children with Ewing sarcoma can be cured. Even if the tumour comes back, further treatment may be given successfully. Your child will be checked up on every few months for the first three years after treatment and then every six months for another two years. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor who knows the situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ewing sarcoma", "introduction": "Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of bone cancer. \n  Bone cancer  is itself rare, with around 600 cases being diagnosed in the UK each year. \n The three main types of primary bone cancer are chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. \n Ewing sarcoma most commonly affects people who are 10 to 20 years old. \n Sarcomas \n A sarcoma is a type of\u00a0cancer\u00a0that develops in the body's supporting tissues. Bone sarcomas and  soft tissue sarcomas \u00a0are the two main types. \n Ewing sarcoma usually occurs in bone. It most commonly develops in the: \n \n pelvis bone\u00a0(hips) \n thigh bone\u00a0(femur) \n shin bone (tibia) \n \n However,\u00a0the condition\u00a0can also develop in the soft tissues surrounding the bone or joint. This type of Ewing sarcoma is known as extraosseous, which means outside the bone. \n Symptoms of Ewing sarcoma \n The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body. \n The main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness. \n Other possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss. \n In some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture. \n What causes Ewing sarcoma? \n Like\u00a0other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is\u00a0unknown. \n As the\u00a0condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is\u00a0that it may be related to fast-growing bones. \n The rapid growth spurt that\u00a0happens during puberty\u00a0may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer. \n Research has also found babies born with an\u00a0umbilical hernia are three times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma.\u00a0 \n However, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition. \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about the  risks and causes of bone cancer . \n Diagnosing Ewing sarcoma \n When\u00a0you visit your GP because of bone pain, they'll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area. \n Your GP may refer you for\u00a0an  X-ray  to check for anything abnormal. If\u00a0abnormalities are found, you'll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist). \n They may recommend that you\u00a0have a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0to examine the area in closer detail. \n A bone  biopsy \u00a0may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle\u00a0is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a\u00a0 general anaesthetic  or a\u00a0 local anaesthetic . \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about  tests for bone cancer \u00a0and  the stages of bone cancer . \n Treating Ewing sarcoma \n Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat. \n Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of  chemotherapy ,\u00a0surgery and radiotherapy. \n Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove. \n Ewing sarcoma also responds well to  radiotherapy . It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning. \n In some cases, surgically removing Ewing's sarcoma can be difficult\u00a0\u2013 for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment. \n Surgery \n If surgery is recommended, the type you'll have will depend on: \n \n the size of the tumour \n where it is in your body \n whether it has\u00a0grown into the tissues surrounding the bone \n \n You may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection. \n Limb-sparing surgery\u00a0involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg\u00a0where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed. \n In some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed ( amputation ).\u00a0This may be the only option\u00a0to prevent the cancer returning if it's spread into the tissues surrounding the bone. \n For more information about the  types of treatment for bone cancer , visit the Cancer Research UK website. \n Living with bone cancer \n If you're diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and\u00a0frightening.\u00a0Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you\u00a0make decisions. \n The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure. \n However, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and  bereavement . \n It's important to seek help and talk about how you're feeling. You could talk to\u00a0your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment. \n There are\u00a0also a number of practical issues you'll need to deal with, such as financial matters\u00a0and coping with day-to-day activities\u00a0such as school, college or work. \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information  about your emotions and cancer \u00a0and  coping with bone cancer . \n Information about you \n If you or your child has\u00a0Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157", "introduction": "Escherichia coli O157, sometimes called VTEC, is a bacterial infection that can cause severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhoea and kidney failure. \n E. coli O157 is found in the gut and faeces of many animals, particularly cattle. It is an uncommon cause of gastroenteritis but can be caught by: \n \n Eating contaminated food (such as raw leafy vegetables or undercooked meat). Always wash all vegetables (including salad leaves) that will be eaten raw,\u00a0unless they have been pre-prepared and are labelled \u2018ready to eat\u2019.\u00a0Washing may reduce the risk of infection, but will not eliminate any risk of infection completely.\u00a0 \n Touching infected animals or accidentally coming into contact with their faeces. \n Contact with people who have the illness, particularly if you do not wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet or before handling food. \n Drinking water from inadequately treated water supplies. \n Swimming or playing in contaminated water, such as ponds or streams. \n \n Symptoms of E. coli O157 infection \n Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea. \n People usually notice symptoms three to four days after they have been infected, but symptoms can start any time between one and 14 days afterwards. \n These symptoms can last up to two weeks. \n A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under\u00a0five years. \n Some people become infected but don't develop symptoms. \n Find out more about\u00a0 gastroenteritis . \n Treatment and care at home \n There is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment. \n It is important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration. \n You should contact your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible if you or your child has bloody diarrhoea. \n Antibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications. \n Anti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin. \n Find out more about\u00a0 caring for a child with gastroenteritis  and  caring for an adult with gastroenteritis . \n How to prevent E. coli O157 from spreading at home \n Strict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected. \n \n Wash your hands thoroughly with soap in running water and dry them completely. Use liquid soap and warm water if you can. \n Everyone must wash their hands after contact with an infected person, particularly after handling their clothes or bedding. \n Always wash hands after going to the toilet or changing babies\u2019 nappies, and before preparing or serving food or eating meals. Anyone who has been infected should avoid cooking or preparing food until 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up. \n Do not share towels or nappy changing mats. \n Wash soiled clothing and bed linen separately from other clothes in a washing machine at the highest temperature possible (e.g. 60\u00b0C). \n Wipe down the outside of the washing machine with hot water and detergent after any heavily soiled load. After handling soiled bedclothes or clothing, wash your hands thoroughly. \n Clean toilet seats, toilet flush handles, basin taps, surfaces and toilet door handles at least daily, preferably more often, using hot water and detergent. \n Disinfection sprays and wipes or alcohol-based wipes may be used on toilet seats and other surfaces, but only after any visible soiling has been removed. \n Thick household bleach is highly effective. Dilute one part bleach to every 10 parts water for soiled surfaces and one part bleach to every 100 parts water for other hard surfaces. Ideally, use heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves and disposable cloths for cleaning. \n Dispose of cloths by placing them in a plastic bag, sealing the neck and placing in household waste. Thoroughly wash rubber gloves in hot water and detergent after use, then rinse and allow to dry. Do not clean soiled items in the kitchen. \n Deal with any spillage of faeces immediately. Clean the soiled area with hot water and detergent using heavy-duty domestic rubber gloves. Clean gloves (as above) and wash hands thoroughly. \n \n Returning to work or school \n Anyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours. \n Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better. \n Some people need to take special care before returning to work or school: \n \n If you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has. \n If you have a child under five years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery. \n Children under five years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Erectile dysfunction (impotence)", "introduction": "Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is the inability to get and maintain an erection. \n Erectile dysfunction\u00a0is a very common condition, particularly in older men. It is estimated that half of all men between the ages of 40\u00a0and 70 will have it to some degree. \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if you have erectile dysfunction for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as  heart disease  (when the heart\u2019s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). \n Why does erectile dysfunction happen? \n Erectile dysfunction\u00a0can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include: \n \n narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis\u00a0\u2013 commonly associated with\u00a0 high blood pressure  (hypertension),\u00a0 high cholesterol  or\u00a0 diabetes  \n hormonal problems \n surgery or injury \n \n Psychological causes of ED include: \n \n anxiety \n  depression \u00a0 \n relationship problems \n \n Sometimes erectile dysfunction only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. \n If this is the case, it is likely the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction is psychological (stress related). If you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is physical. \n Erectile dysfunction can also be a side-effect of using certain medicines. \n Read more about the  causes of erectile dysfunction  \n Diagnosis \n Although you may be embarrassed, it's important to get a diagnosis\u00a0so that the cause can be identified. \n Your GP can usually diagnose erectile dysfunction. This will involve answering questions about your symptoms, as well as a physical examination and some simple tests. \n Read more about  diagnosing erectile dysfunction  \n How is erectile dysfunction treated? \n Erectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological. \n The narrowing of the arteries (called atherosclerosis) is one of the most common causes of ED. In these cases\u00a0your GP may suggest lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, to try to reduce your risk of  cardiovascular disease . This may\u00a0help to relieve your symptoms as well as improving your general health. \n You may also be given medication to treat atherosclerosis, such as cholesterol-lowering\u00a0 statins  and drugs to reduce your blood pressure. \n A number of treatments\u00a0have\u00a0been successful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Medication, such\u00a0as sildenafil (sold as Viagra),\u00a0can be used to manage it in at least two-thirds of cases. Vacuum pumps that encourage blood to flow to the penis and cause an erection are also successful in 90% of cases. \n Psychological treatments\u00a0include\u00a0cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and sex therapy. \n Overall, treatments for\u00a0erectile dysfunction\u00a0have improved significantly in recent years. Most men are eventually able to have sex again. \n Read more about  treating erectile dysfunction", "symptoms": "The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse. \n ED should not be confused with\u00a0ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly. \n Inability to get an erection \n Sometimes ED only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner. \n In these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ED is primarily psychological (stress related). However, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical. \n Seek medical advice \n See your GP if ED persists for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as\u00a0 heart disease  (when the heart\u2019s blood supply is blocked or interrupted). \n Many websites offer treatments for ED but their use is not recommended. The medications that are offered by these sites could be fake and may be dangerous. Even if the medications are genuine, they may not be suitable for you. \n It is important that you only take medication for ED that your GP has prescribed for you. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating erectile dysfunction", "causes": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) can have many causes, such as certain medical conditions, medications and stress. \n It's important to identify\u00a0the cause of erectile dysfunction and treat any underlying conditions. \n Erections \n When\u00a0a man\u00a0becomes sexually excited (aroused), his brain sends signals to the nerves in his penis. The nerves increase the blood flow to the penis, causing the tissue to expand and harden. \n Anything that interferes with the nervous system or the blood circulation could lead to\u00a0erectile dysfunction. \n Anything that affects the level of sexual desire (libido)\u00a0can also cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction because a  reduced libido  makes it more difficult for the brain to trigger an erection. Psychological conditions, such as  depression , can reduce libido, as can changes in hormone levels (chemicals produced by the body). \n Physical causes \n There are four main types of health conditions that can cause physical problems resulting in\u00a0erectile dysfunction. These are: \n \n conditions affecting the flow of blood to your penis\u00a0\u2013 vasculogenic \n conditions affecting your nervous system, which is made up of your brain, nerves and spinal cord \u2013 neurogenic \n conditions affecting your hormone levels \u2013 hormonal \n conditions affecting the physical structure of your penis\u00a0\u2013 anatomical \n \n Injuries and surgery \n Penis injuries or surgical treatment of the penis, pelvis or surrounding areas can sometimes lead to erectile dysfunction. \n Erectile dysfunction is also thought to occur in up to 15-25% of people who\u00a0experience a  severe head injury . \n Vasculogenic conditions \n Examples of vasculogenic conditions that cause erectile dysfunction include: \n \n  cardiovascular disease \u00a0\u2013 a disease of the heart or blood vessels, such as atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)\u00a0 \n  high blood pressure \u00a0(hypertension) \n  diabetes \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a condition caused by high blood sugar levels. This can affect both the blood supply and the nerve endings in your penis, so it is also a neurogenic condition \n \n Erectile dysfunction\u00a0is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. For this reason, it may be one of the first causes your GP considers when\u00a0making a diagnosis\u00a0and planning your treatment. \n Neurogenic conditions \n Examples of neurogenic conditions that cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction include: \n \n  multiple sclerosis \u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the body's actions, such as movement and balance\u00a0 \n  Parkinson\u2019s disease \u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the way that the brain coordinates body movements, including walking, talking and writing \n a spinal injury or disorder \n a\u00a0 stroke \u00a0\u2013 a serious condition that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted \n \n Hormonal conditions \n Examples of hormonal conditions that cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction include: \n \n hypogonadism\u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the production of the male sex hormone, testosterone, causing abnormally low levels\u00a0 \n an\u00a0 overactive thyroid gland  (hyperthyroidism)\u00a0\u2013 where too much thyroid hormone is produced \n an\u00a0 underactive thyroid gland  (hypothyroidism) \u2013 where not enough thyroid hormone is produced\u00a0 \n  Cushing's syndrome \u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the production of a hormone called cortisol \n \n Anatomical conditions \n Peyronie's disease, which affects the tissue of the penis, is an example of an anatomical condition that can cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction. \n Medicine\u00a0 \n In some men,\u00a0certain medicines can cause\u00a0erectile dysfunction, including: \n \n diuretics \u2013 these increase the production of urine and are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure and kidney disease\u00a0 \n antihypertensives\u00a0\u2013 such as  beta-blockers , that are used to treat high blood pressure \n fibrates\u00a0\u2013 medicines used to lower\u00a0 cholesterol  levels \n antipsychotics\u00a0\u2013 used to treat some mental health conditions, such as\u00a0 schizophrenia \u00a0 \n  antidepressants \u00a0\u2013\u00a0 used to treat depression and some types of pain \n  corticosteroids \u00a0\u2013 medication that contains steroids, which are a type of hormone \n H2-antagonists\u00a0\u2013 medicines used to treat  stomach ulcers  \n anticonvulsants\u00a0\u2013 used to treat\u00a0 epilepsy  \n  antihistamines \u00a0\u2013\u00a0used to treat allergic health conditions, such as\u00a0 hay fever  \n anti-androgens\u00a0\u2013 medication that suppresses androgens (male sex hormones)\u00a0 \n cytotoxics\u00a0\u2013 medication used in  chemotherapy  to prevent cancer cells from dividing and growing \n \n Speak to your GP if you are concerned that a prescribed medicine is causing erectile dysfunction. Alternative medication may be available. However,\u00a0it is important never to\u00a0stop taking a prescribed medicine unless you are advised to do so by a qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care. \n Psychological causes \n Possible psychological causes of\u00a0erectile dysfunction include: \n \n  depression \u00a0\u2013 feelings of extreme sadness that last for a long time \n anxiety\u00a0\u2013 a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear \n \n Erectile dysfunction can often have both physical and psychological causes. For example, if you have diabetes, it may be difficult for you to get an erection, which may cause you to become anxious about the situation. The combination of diabetes and anxiety may lead to an episode of erectile dysfunction. \n There are\u00a0many emotional issues that may also affect your physical ability to get or maintain an erection. These include: \n \n relationship problems \n lack of sexual knowledge \n past sexual problems \n past sexual abuse \n being in a new relationship\u00a0 \n \n Other causes \n Other possible causes of\u00a0erectile dysfunction\u00a0include: \n \n excessive alcohol intake\u00a0 \n tiredness \n using illegal drugs, such as cannabis, heroin or cocaine \n \n Cycling \n Men who cycle for more than three hours per week may be recommended to try a period without cycling to see if this helps improve erectile dysfunction. \n Riding in the correct position with a properly fitted seat may also help to prevent regular cycling from leading to erectile dysfunction.", "treatment": "If you have erectile dysfunction (ED), treatment will depend on what's causing it. The various treatments for erectile dysfunction are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Treating underlying conditions \n If your\u00a0erectile dysfunction is caused by an underlying health condition, such as  heart disease  or  diabetes , that condition may need to be treated first. In some cases, treating the underlying cause may also resolve the problem. \n If you are taking medication that can cause erectile dysfunction, there may be an alternative. It is important never to stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are advised to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. \n Lifestyle changes \n Erectile dysfunction can often be improved by making changes to your lifestyle, such as: \n \n  losing weight  if you are overweight\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n  giving up smoking  \n cutting back\u00a0your  alcohol  consumption\u00a0 \n not taking illegal drugs\u00a0 \n  exercising regularly \u00a0 \n reducing\u00a0 stress \u00a0 \n \n As well as helping to improve your\u00a0erectile dysfunction, these changes can also improve your general health and may help to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels). \n Read more about\u00a0 preventing cardiovascular disease \u00a0\u00a0 \n Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors \n Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are one of the most widely used and effective types of medication for treating erectile dysfunction. They work by temporarily increasing the blood flow to your penis. \n In England,\u00a0four PDE-5 inhibitors are available for treating erectile dysfunction. They are: \n \n sildenafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Viagra\u00a0 \n tadalafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Cialis \n vardenafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Levitra \n avanafil\u00a0\u2013 sold under the brand name Spedra \n \n Sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil work for about eight hours and they are designed to work 'on demand'. Tadalafil lasts for up to 36 hours and is more suitable if you require treatment for a longer period of time, for example, over a weekend. \n Depending on the type of PDE-5 inhibitor you are taking and the dose, it should take about 30-60 minutes before it starts to work. With sildenafil, vardenafil and avanafil, you should be able to have sex from one to 10 hours after taking the medicine. After taking tadalafil, the effects will last for up to 36 hours. \n It may take longer to notice the effects if the tablet is taken with food, so it's best to take it on an empty stomach. You can then eat after an hour without affecting the medicine. \n Only take one tablet within a 24-hour period. \n Your GP should explain the benefits of each medication and how it works. The choice may depend on: \n \n how often you are sexually active\u00a0 \n whether you have tried any of the medications before \n \n There have been many studies to test the effectiveness of these medications. In general,\u00a0at least\u00a0two-thirds of men report having improved erections after taking one of these medicines. \n If you do not find that PDE-5 inhibitors are effective it may be because: \n \n you have not waited long enough after taking the dose \n you have waited too long after taking the dose \n the dose is not high enough \n you have not had enough sexual stimulation \n \n These medications are triggered by sexual stimulation, so you also need to be aroused for it to work. \n Warnings \n PDE-5 inhibitors should be used\u00a0with caution in men who have  cardiovascular disease , such as coronary heart disease. However, sexual activity is also likely to be beneficial for your cardiovascular health. You should discuss the risks and benefits with your GP. \n PDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who have anatomical problems with their penis, such as Peyronie's disease (a condition that affects the tissue of the penis). \n PDE-5 inhibitors should also be used with caution in men who: \n \n are at risk of priapism\u00a0\u2013 a painful erection that lasts for several hours \n are also taking long lasting alpha-blockers \u2013 a medication used to treat a number of conditions, such as  high blood pressure  (hypertension) \n \n Do not take PDE-5 inhibitors if you are also taking medicines or recreational drugs that contain nitrates. The combination of the two substances can have a dangerous effect on your heart. \n Organic nitrates are often used to treat angina, and butyl nitrate is a recreational drug that is more commonly known as 'poppers'. \n You\u00a0are\u00a0also\u00a0warned\u00a0not to take PDE-5 inhibitors if you: \n \n have been advised not to take part in sexual activity or in activities that widen your blood vessels\u00a0 \n have\u00a0 low blood pressure  (hypotension)\u00a0 \n have recently had a\u00a0 stroke \u00a0\u2013 a medical emergency that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted \n have unstable\u00a0 angina \u00a0\u2013 an underlying heart condition that causes symptoms such as chest pain \n have had a\u00a0 heart attack \u00a0\u2013 a medical emergency where the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked \n have a history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy\u00a0\u2013 an eye condition that causes a sudden loss of vision \n \n Side effects \n PDE-5 inhibitors can cause some side effects, including: \n \n headaches and migraines \n flushing (redness)\u00a0 \n indigestion \n nausea (feeling sick) \n vomiting (being sick) \n a blocked or runny nose \n back pain \n vision disturbances \n muscle pain \n \n Vacuum pumps \n A vacuum pump consists of a clear plastic tube that is connected to a pump, which is either hand or battery operated. \n You place your penis in the tube and pump out all of the air. This creates a vacuum that causes the blood to fill your penis, making it erect. You then place a rubber ring around the base of your penis to keep the blood in place, allowing you to maintain an erection for around 30 minutes. \n It may take several attempts to learn how to use the pump correctly, but they are usually effective. After using a vacuum pump,\u00a0nine out of 10 men are able to have sex, regardless of the cause of their ED. \n Considerations\u00a0 \n You should not use a vacuum pump if you have a bleeding disorder or if you are taking  anticoagulant medicines , which reduce the ability of your blood to clot. \n Side effects of vacuum pumps include pain or bruising, although these occur in less than a third of men. \n Men who qualify for NHS prescriptions for erectile dysfunction treatments may be able to get a vacuum pump on the NHS (see above for more details). However,\u00a0some men will need to buy one. \n The\u00a0 Sexual Advice Association  produces a number of factsheets, including one on vacuum pumps\u00a0that provides details of companies that supply them. \n Alprostadil \n If your\u00a0erectile dysfunction doesn't\u00a0respond to treatment, or you are unable or unwilling to use PDE-5 inhibitors or a vacuum pump, you may be given a medicine called alprostadil. This is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that helps to stimulate blood flow to the penis. \n Alprostadil is available as: \n \n an injection directly into your penis\u00a0\u2013 this is called an intracavernosal injection \n a small pellet placed inside your urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the tip of your penis)\u00a0\u2013 this is called urethral application \n \n You may be trained to correctly inject or insert alprostadil. If your partner is pregnant,\u00a0use a condom during sex if you are inserting alprostadil into your urethra. \n Alprostadil will usually produce an erection after five to 15 minutes. How long the erection lasts will depend on the dose. \n In men who did not respond to PDE-5 inhibitors, alprostadil injections were successful in 85 out of 100 men. Alprostadil inserted into the urethra is successful for up to two-thirds of men. \n Warnings \n Alprostadil should not be used: \n \n in\u00a0men at risk of priapism (a painful erection that lasts for several hours)\u00a0\u2013 for example, those with sickle cell anaemia \n alongside other\u00a0erectile dysfunction medications\u00a0 \n if you have a penile implant or if you have been advised to avoid sexual activity\u00a0 \n \n Urethral application may also not be used in: \n \n some\u00a0men who have anatomical problems with their penis (conditions that affect the physical structure of the penis)\u00a0 \n men who have infections of their penis, such as\u00a0balantis\u00a0(inflammation of the head of the penis) \n \n Side effects \n Alprostadil can cause some side effects including: \n \n changes in your blood pressure \n dizziness \n headache \n pain in your penis\u00a0 \n urethral burning or bleeding \n reactions at the site of the injection, such as swelling \n \n NHS prescriptions \n As with PDE-5 inhibitors, NHS prescriptions for alprostadil may only be available for\u00a0men with particular health conditions or those receiving some types of medical treatments. If you need to pay the full prescription cost, a single injection of alprostadil costs around \u00a38 to \u00a322, depending on the dose. A single dose of alprostadil for urethral application is around \u00a310.\u00a0 \n Hormone therapy \n If a hormonal condition is causing\u00a0erectile dysfunction, you may be referred to an endocrinologist (who specialises in the treatment of hormonal conditions). \n Hormones are chemicals produced by the body. Many hormonal conditions can be treated using injections of synthetic (man-made) hormones to restore normal hormone levels. \n Surgery \n Surgery for\u00a0erectile dysfunction is usually only recommended if all other treatment methods have failed. It may also be considered in: \n \n younger men who have experienced serious injury to their pelvic area\u00a0\u2013 for example, in a car accident \n men with a significant anatomical problem with their penis \n \n In the past, surgery was used if there was clear evidence of a blockage to the blood supply of the penis. The surgeon could unblock the blood vessels to restore a normal supply of blood. However, research now suggests that the long-term results of this type of surgery are poor, so it's unlikely to be used. \n Penile implants \n Penile implants are a type of surgery that may be considered. These can be: \n \n semi-rigid implants \u2013 which may be suitable for older men who do not have sex regularly \n inflatable implants \u2013 which consist of two or three parts that can be inflated to give a more natural erection \n \n Penile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants may be very expensive. However, around three-quarters of men report being satisfied with the results of this type of surgery. \n Complications \n As with all types of surgery, having penile implants inserted\u00a0carries a risk of infection. If you take preventative antibiotics, the rate of infection is around\u00a0two\u00a0or three\u00a0in 100. Mechanical problems with the implants may occur within five years in\u00a0five\u00a0per cent of\u00a0cases.\u00a0 \n Psychological treatments \n If your\u00a0erectile dysfunction has an underlying psychological cause then you may benefit from a type of treatment called sensate focus. \n If conditions such as anxiety or depression are causing your\u00a0erectile dysfunction, you may benefit from\u00a0counselling\u00a0(a talking therapy). \n Sensate focus \n Sensate focus is a type of sex therapy that you and your partner complete together. It starts with you\u00a0both agreeing not to have sex for a number of weeks or months. During this time, you can still touch each other, but not in the genital area (or a woman\u2019s breasts). The idea is to explore your bodies knowing that you will not have sex. \n After the agreed period of time has passed, you can gradually begin touching each other\u2019s genital areas. You can also begin to use your mouth to touch your partner, for example, licking or kissing, them. This can build up to include penetrative sex. \n You can find out more about sensate focus from the  College\u00a0of\u00a0Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT) . \n Psychosexual counselling \n Psychosexual counselling is a form of relationship therapy where you and your partner can discuss any sexual or emotional issues that may be contributing to your\u00a0erectile dysfunction. By talking about the issues, you may be able to reduce any anxiety that you have and overcome your\u00a0erectile dysfunction. \n The counsellor can also provide you with some practical advice about sex, such as how to make effective use of other treatments for\u00a0erectile dysfunction to improve your sex life. \n Psychosexual counselling may take time to work and the results achieved have been mixed. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another form of counselling that may be useful if you have\u00a0erectile dysfunction. CBT is based on the principle that the way you feel is partly dependent on the way you think about things. CBT helps you realise that your problems are often created by your mindset. It is not the situation itself that is making you unhappy, but how you think about it and react to it. \n Your CBT therapist can help you to identify any unhelpful or unrealistic thoughts that may be contributing to your erectile dysfunction \u2013 for example, to do with: \n \n your self-esteem (the way you feel about yourself)\u00a0 \n your sexuality\u00a0 \n your personal relationships \n \n Your CBT therapist will be able to help you to adopt more realistic and helpful thoughts about these issues. \n Pelvic floor muscle exercises \n Some studies have suggested that, in a few cases, it may be beneficial to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. These are a group of muscles around the underside of the bladder and rectum, as well as at the base of the penis. \n Pelvic floor muscle exercise involves strengthening and training the muscles used to control the anus (back passage) and urinate. If your GP feels this type of exercise could be beneficial, then you may want to discuss it with a physiotherapist to learn it correctly. \n By strengthening and training\u00a0these muscles, you may be able to reduce the symptoms of\u00a0erectile dysfunction. \n Complementary therapies \n Some complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, have claimed to treat erectile dysfunction. However, there is little evidence they are useful. \n In some cases, they may even include ingredients that could interact with other medications and cause side effects. \n Always speak to your GP before using any complementary therapies.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) can often be diagnosed by your GP. They will talk to you about your situation and may carry out a physical examination. \n Your GP may ask you about: \n \n your symptoms \n your overall physical and mental health \n your alcohol consumption \n whether you take drugs \n whether you are currently taking any medication \n \n If you do not want to talk to your GP about erectile dysfunction, you can visit a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. You can find your nearest GUM clinic on the  British Association for Sexual Health and HIV\u00a0(BASHH)  website. \n Sexual history \n You'll also be asked\u00a0about your sexual history. Try not to be embarrassed because\u00a0erectile dysfunction is a common problem.\u00a0You can request a male GP at your surgery if you prefer. \n You may be asked about: \n \n your previous and current sexual relationships\u00a0 \n what your sexual orientation is\u00a0 \n how long you have been experiencing erectile dysfunction \n whether you can get any degree of erection with your partner, on your own or when you wake up in the morning\u00a0 \n whether you have been able to ejaculate or orgasm \n your libido (your level of sexual desire) \n \n Erectile dysfunction\u00a0that\u00a0happens all the time may suggest an underlying physical cause. \n Erectile dysfunction that\u00a0only occurs when you are attempting to have sex may suggest an underlying psychological (mental) cause. \n Assessing your cardiovascular health \n Your GP may assess your cardiovascular health. Narrowed blood vessels are a common cause of erectile dysfunction and linked with  cardiovascular disease  (conditions that affect the heart and blood flow). \n Your GP may: \n \n measure your blood pressure to see if you have\u00a0 high blood pressure  (hypertension) \n listen to your heart rate to check for any abnormalities \n measure your height, weight and waist circumference to see if you are a healthy weight for your height\u00a0 \n ask you about your diet and lifestyle, for example, how much exercise you do \n test a sample of your blood for glucose (sugar) and lipids (fatty substances), as high levels can indicate conditions affecting your heart or blood vessels \n \n Physical examinations and tests \n A\u00a0physical examination of your penis may be carried out\u00a0to rule out anatomical causes (conditions that affect the physical structure of your penis). \n If you have symptoms of an  enlarged prostate , such as weak or irregular urination, a\u00a0 digital rectal examination (DRE)  may be suggested.\u00a0 \n  Blood tests \u00a0can also\u00a0check for underlying health conditions. For example, measuring the levels of hormones such as testosterone can rule out hormonal conditions, such as hypogonadism (an abnormally low level of testosterone). \n Further testing \n In some cases you may be referred to a specialist for further testing. This might be the case if you\u00a0are unusually young to be experiencing\u00a0erectile dysfunction as it's rare in men under 40 years of age.\u00a0 \n Intracavernous injection test \n An intracavernous injection test involves injecting a man-made (synthetic) hormone into your penis to increase the blood flow. This helps\u00a0assess any\u00a0abnormalities in your penis and plan surgery.\u00a0 \n If the injection doesn't result in an\u00a0erection it may indicate a problem with the blood supply to your penis. In some cases, you may also need an  ultrasound scan . \n Arteriography and dynamic infusion cavernosometry or cavernosography \n These specialised tests involve injecting dye into the blood vessels of your penis and studying the dye on a scanner. These are likely to be used if you are being considered for surgery or if a problem has been detected with your blood vessels. \n Psychological assessment \n If the cause of your erectile dysfunction is thought to be psychological, you may be reffered\u00a0for a psychological assessment."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Epilepsy", "introduction": "Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated seizures. \n Epilepsy is estimated to affect\u00a0more than 500,000\u00a0people in the UK. This means that almost one in every 100 people has the condition. \n Seizures \n The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals and communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses, which can cause the brain and body to behave strangely. \n The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people simply experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a \"trance-like\" state for a few seconds or minutes, while others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body). \n Some people may only have a single seizure at some point during their life. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.\u00a0 \n Read more about the  symptoms of epilepsy  \n What causes epilepsy? \n Epilepsy can start at any age, but\u00a0it most often begins during childhood. \n It's often not possible to identify a specific reason why someone develops the\u00a0condition, although some cases \u2013 particularly those that occur later in life \u2013 are associated with damage to the brain. \n For example,\u00a0epilepsy can be caused by  strokes ,\u00a0 brain tumours  and  severe head injuries . \n Some cases of epilepsy may be caused by changes in the brain that occur as a result of the genes you inherit from your parents. \n Read more about the  causes of epilepsy  \n How\u00a0epilepsy is diagnosed \n Epilepsy is most often\u00a0diagnosed after you have had more than one seizure. This is because many people have a one-off epileptic seizure during their lifetime. \n The most important information needed to make a diagnosis is a description of your seizures from yourself and someone who witnessed the event, but tests may also be carried out to help determine which areas of your brain are affected and look for a potential cause. \n Read more about  diagnosing epilepsy  \n How epilepsy is treated \n For most people with epilepsy, treatment with medications called anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is recommended. These medications cannot cure epilepsy, but they are often very effective in controlling seizures. \n It can take some time to find the right type and correct dose\u00a0of AED\u00a0before your seizures can be controlled. \n In\u00a0a few\u00a0cases, surgery may be used to remove a specific\u00a0area of the brain\u00a0that is affected or to install an electrical\u00a0device that can help control seizures. \n Read more about  treating epilepsy  \n Living with epilepsy \n While epilepsy is different for everyone, there are some general rules that can make living with the condition easier. \n It's important to stay healthy through regular exercise, getting enough sleep, eating a  balanced diet \u00a0and avoiding excessive drinking. \n You may have to think about your epilepsy before you undertake things such as driving, using contraception and planning a pregnancy. \n Advice is available from your GP or support groups to help you adjust to life with epilepsy. \n Read more about  living with epilepsy", "symptoms": "The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are many different types of seizure, depending on the area of the brain affected. \n People with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms. \n Seizures can occur when you are awake or asleep. \n Doctors classify seizures by how much of the brain is affected. There are: \n \n partial (or focal) seizures \u2013 where only a small part of the brain is affected \n generalised seizures \u2013 where most or all of the brain is affected \n \n Some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures. \n Partial seizures \n There are two main types of partial seizure. \n Simple partial seizures \n Simple partial seizures are where you remain fully conscious throughout. \n Symptoms of a simple partial seizure can include: \n \n a general strange feeling\u00a0that is hard to describe \n a \"rising\" feeling in\u00a0your\u00a0tummy \u2013 sometimes likened to the sensation in your stomach when on a fairground ride \n an intense feeling that events have happened before (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu) \n experiencing an unusual smell or taste \n a\u00a0tingling sensation, or \"pins and needles\", in your arms and legs \n a sudden intense feeling of fear or joy \n stiffness or twitching in part of the body, such as an arm or hand \n \n These seizures are sometimes known as \"warnings\" or \"auras\", because they can be a sign that another type of seizure is\u00a0on its way.\u00a0This can give you time to warn people around you and make sure you are in a safe place. \n Complex partial seizures \n Complex partial seizures are when you lose your sense of awareness and can\u2019t remember what happened after the seizure has passed. \n The symptoms of a complex partial seizure normally involve apparently strange and random bodily behaviour, such as: \n \n smacking your lips \n rubbing your hands \n making random noises \n moving your arms around \n picking at clothes \n fiddling with objects \n adopting an unusual posture \n chewing or swallowing \n \n During a complex partial seizure, you will not be able to respond to anyone else, and you will have no memory of the event. \n Generalised seizures \n There are six main types of generalised seizure. \n Absences \n Absence seizures, which used to be called petit mal, mainly affect children, but they also occur in adults. They cause the person to lose awareness of their surroundings, usually for up to 15 seconds. The person will seem to stare vacantly into space, although some people will flutter their eyes or smack their lips. The person will have no memory of the seizure. \n Absences can occur several times a day. They may affect a child's performance at school, and can be dangerous if they occur at a critical time, such as crossing a busy road. \n Myoclonic seizures \n These types of seizures cause your arms, legs or upper body to jerk or twitch, as if you have received an electric shock. They often only last for a fraction of a second, and you will normally remain conscious during this time. \n Myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up and can occur in combination with other types of generalised seizures. \n Clonic seizures \n These cause the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except the symptoms will last longer, normally up to two minutes. Loss of consciousness may also occur. \n Atonic seizures \n Atonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly relax, so there is a chance you\u00a0may fall to the ground and there is a risk you could injure yourself. \n Tonic seizures \n Tonic seizures cause all your muscles to suddenly become stiff, which can mean you lose balance and fall over. Like atonic seizures, there is a risk of injury. \n Tonic-clonic seizures \n Tonic-clonic seizures or convulsions, which used to be known as grand mal, have two stages. Your body will initially become stiff and then your arms and legs will begin twitching. You will lose consciousness and some people will wet themselves. The seizure normally lasts a few minutes, but can last longer. \n This type of seizure is what most people think of as an epileptic fit. \n What to do if someone has a seizure \n If you see someone having a seizure, there are simple things you can do to help. \n Tonic-clonic seizures \n If you are with someone who has a tonic-clonic seizure: \n \n protect them from injury\u00a0by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby, and cushioning their head with your hands or soft material \n do not restrain them or attempt to move them (unless they are in immediate danger) and don't put anything in their mouth \n stay calm, and stay with them until they regain consciousness \n \n When the convulsions have stopped, put them into the  recovery position \u00a0until they have recovered. \n Other types of seizure \n If someone is having one of the\u00a0other types of seizure: \n \n protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby, and cushioning their head with your hands or soft material \n only attempt to move them if\u00a0they are in immediate danger \n stay with\u00a0them and comfort them until they have fully recovered \n \n When to call an ambulance \n It will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure. However, you should call 999 if: \n \n the seizure has not stopped after five minutes \n the person has more than one seizure without recovering in between \n you know it is the person's\u00a0first seizure \n the person is injured, has breathing problems, or needs emergency medical attention for any other reason \n the person\u2019s behaviour after a seizure is unsafe \n \n Status epilepticus \n Status epilepticus is the name for\u00a0any seizure that lasts longer than 30 minutes, or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between. This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible. \n You can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy, but if you haven't had any training, it is important to call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus. \n If you\u00a0have been trained to treat the condition, you will usually have been advised to use either: \n \n a medication called\u00a0diazepam that is placed in\u00a0the person's rectum \n a medication called buccal midazolam that\u00a0 comes in liquid form and is given by trickling the liquid onto the inside of the person's cheek \n \n If\u00a0you have tried one of these treatments and the seizures are continuing, call 999 for an ambulance.", "causes": "In over half of epilepsy cases, a cause cannot be found. If there is an identifiable cause, it usually involves the brain being affected by a condition. \n The brain is a delicate mix of nerve cells, electrical impulses and chemicals, known as neurotransmitters. Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures. \n There are\u00a0two main categories of epilepsy: \n \n idiopathic (or primary) epilepsy \u2013\u00a0where no apparent cause for epilepsy can be found, but there may be a family history, suggesting that the condition is inherited \n symptomatic (or secondary)\u00a0epilepsy \u2013 where there is a known cause for a person\u2019s epilepsy \n \n Idiopathic epilepsy \n In many cases, no cause of epilepsy is found. This may be because medical equipment is not advanced enough to spot some types of damage, or because the epilepsy has a genetic cause. \n Many researchers have suggested that small genetic changes in the brain could be the cause of epilepsy. Current research is looking for defects in certain genes that may affect electrical transmission in the brain. \n A number of studies have been carried out; however, no strong association has so far been found between any particular genes and the development of epilepsy. \n Symptomatic epilepsy \n Causes of symptomatic epilepsy can include: \n \n cerebrovascular disease\u00a0(problems with the blood vessels that supply the brain) \u2013 such as a  stroke  or\u00a0subarachnoid haemorrhage \n  brain tumours  \n  severe head injuries  \n drug abuse and  alcohol misuse  \n infections that can damage the brain \u2013 such as  meningitis  \n problems during birth that cause a baby to be deprived of oxygen \u2013 such as the umbilical cord getting twisted or compressed during labour \n some parts of the brain not developing properly \n \n Although some of these problems can cause\u00a0epilepsy in childhood,\u00a0symptomatic\u00a0epilepsy is generally more common in older people \u2013 particularly those over 60 years of age. \n Seizure triggers \n For many people with epilepsy, seizures can occur without any obvious trigger. However, certain circumstances or the use of certain substances can sometimes precede a seizure. These include: \n \n stress \n lack of sleep \n drinking alcohol \n some medications and illegal drugs \n in women, monthly periods \n flashing lights (this is an uncommon trigger that\u00a0affects only 5% of people with epilepsy, and is known as photosensitive epilepsy) \n \n Keeping a seizure diary is a good way to help find out what might trigger your seizures. Every time you have a seizure, record it and make a note of what you were doing.\u00a0Over time, you might notice\u00a0some potentially avoidable things that seem to trigger your symptoms.", "treatment": "Most people with epilepsy can be successfully treated with\u00a0AEDs. AEDs do not cure epilepsy, but can prevent seizures from occurring. \n There are many different AEDs. Generally, they work by changing the levels of the chemicals in your brain that conduct electrical impulses. This reduces the chance of a seizure. \n The type of AED recommended for you will depend on a number of factors, including the type of seizures you have, your age, whether there\u00a0are any\u00a0concerns about a certain AED interacting with other\u00a0medicines (such as the  contraceptive pill ),\u00a0and whether you are thinking of having a baby. \n Examples of commonly used AEDs include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, ethosuximide and topiramate. \n Taking AEDs \n AEDs are available in a number of different forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids and syrups. \n It is important you follow any advice about when to take AEDs and how much to take. Never suddenly stop taking an AED because doing so could cause a seizure. \n Your specialist will start you on a low dose of an AED, then gradually increase it within safe limits until your seizures stop, or if you develop side-effects. If one AED does not control seizures, another will be tried by gradually introducing the new medication and slowly reducing the dose of the old one. \n The aim is to achieve maximum seizure control with minimum side effects, using the lowest possible dose of a single medicine. Trying a different type of AED is preferable to taking more than one AED, although a combination of medicines may sometimes be necessary to control seizures. \n While taking AEDs, do not take any other medicines, including over-the-counter medicines or complementary medicines such as St John's Wort, without first speaking to your GP or epilepsy specialist. Other medicines could have a dangerous interaction with your AED and cause a seizure. \n Sodium valproate is not usually prescribed for women of childbearing age because there is a risk it could\u00a0cause physical defects or developmental problems in\u00a0an unborn baby. \n It can be used if there is no alternative, or if your specialist has assessed you and\u00a0it's unlikely you'll respond to or tolerate other treatments.\u00a0Your specialist or\u00a0GP will also need to check you are using a reliable form of contraception.\u00a0\u00a0Learn more about the  risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy . \n If you do not have a seizure for more than two years, it may be possible to stop taking your AEDs. Your epilepsy specialist can discuss with you whether this is appropriate and the best way this can be done. \n Side effects \n Side effects are common when starting treatment with AEDs. However, they are usually short-lived and pass in a few days. \n The specific side effects you may experience will depend on the medication you are taking, but general common side effects\u00a0of AEDs include: \n \n drowsiness \n a lack of energy \n agitation \n  headaches  \n uncontrollable shaking (tremor) \n hair loss\u00a0or unwanted hair growth \n swollen gums \n rashes \n \n If you develop a rash, this may mean that you are allergic to the medication. In this case seek medical advice right away. \n Sometimes, you may experience\u00a0symptoms similar to being drunk \u2013 such as\u00a0unsteadiness, poor concentration and vomiting \u2013 if your dose is too high. Contact your GP or epilepsy specialist immediately if you experience these side effects so that your dose can be revised. \n For information on the side effects of a particular AED, check the information leaflet that comes with your medication. \n Brain surgery \n If your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with AEDs, you may be referred to a specialist epilepsy centre to see if you are suitable for surgery to remove the part of your brain causing your seizures. \n This involves having various types of brain scans to find out where the epilepsy is focused. Memory and psychological tests are also conducted to assess how you are likely to cope with the stress of surgery and how it might affect you. \n Surgery is only recommended when: \n \n a\u00a0single\u00a0area of the brain is causing seizures (partial or focal seizures) \n removing that part of the brain would not cause any significant loss of brain function \n \n As with all types of surgery, this procedure carries a number of risks. This includes a risk of serious problems such as memory problems and strokes after the operation. However, around 70% of people who have epilepsy surgery become completely free of seizures. \n Before having the procedure, your surgeon will explain to you the benefits and risks of the surgery. \n Most people normally recover from the effects of surgery after a few days, but it could be several months before you are fully fit and able to return to work. \n Alternative procedures \n If your epilepsy is still poorly controlled after trying treatment with AEDs, and brain surgery is not suitable for you, your doctor may recommend an alternative procedure. \n The most commonly used alternative to surgery is vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), although in a few cases deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be recommended. \n Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) \n VNS involves surgically implanting a small electrical device, similar to a  pacemaker , under your skin, near your collarbone. \n The device has a wire that is wrapped around one of the nerves in the left side of your neck, known as the vagus nerve. The device passes a regular dose of electricity to the nerve to stimulate it. This can help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. \n If you feel the warning sign of a seizure coming on, you can activate an extra \"burst\" of stimulation, which may prevent the seizure from occurring. \n How and why VNS works is not fully understood, but it is thought that stimulating the vagus nerve alters the chemical transmissions in the brain. \n Most people who undergo VNS still need to take AEDs. \n Some mild to moderate side effects of VNS therapy have been reported, including hoarseness,\u00a0sore throat and a cough when\u00a0the device is being used (this normally occurs every five minutes and lasts for 30 seconds). \n The battery for the VNS device typically lasts up to 10 years, after which time a further procedure will be needed to replace it. \n Deep brain stimulation (DBS) \n DBS\u00a0involves implanting electrodes into specific areas of the brain to\u00a0reduce the abnormal electrical activity associated with a seizure. \n The electrodes are controlled by an external device implanted under the skin of the chest, which is usually permanently switched on. \n DBS can help reduce the frequency of seizures, but there are concerns about serious risks associated with the procedure, including bleeding on the brain,\u00a0 depression  and memory problems. \n Ketogenic diet \n A ketogenic diet a diet high in fats and low in carbohydrates and protein, and it is thought that it may make seizures less likely by altering the chemical composition of the brain. \n It was one of the main\u00a0treatments for epilepsy used before AEDs were available, but\u00a0is no longer recommended for adults with the condition because a high-fat diet is linked to serious health conditions, such as\u00a0 diabetes  and  cardiovascular disease (CVD) . \n However,\u00a0a ketogenic diet is sometimes advised for children with seizures that are difficult to control and have not responded to AEDs because it has been shown to reduce the number of seizures in some children. It should only be used under the supervision of an epilepsy specialist with the help of a dietitian. \n Good epilepsy care \n The Department of Health has developed a National Service Framework (NSF) for long-term conditions. \n This gives guidance to doctors, nurses and healthcare staff on how to provide care to patients. It was developed in consultation with people with long-term neurological conditions, including epilepsy. It tells staff how to give services that are co-ordinated, matched to people\u2019s needs, and easy to use. \n Patients can also use the National Service Framework. It can: \n \n provide information and support to help you make decisions about your care \n give you a choice about how and where you get treatment and care \n help you live more independently \n \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has also published guidelines on the  diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in adults and children  \n The guidelines give comprehensive and objective information on the benefits and limitations of the various ways of diagnosing, treating and caring for people with epilepsy. They can help health professionals and patients decide on the most appropriate treatment. \n Complementary therapies \n There are several complementary therapies that some people with epilepsy feel\u00a0work for them. However, none has been shown conclusively in\u00a0medical studies to reduce seizures. \n Therefore, you should treat with caution advice from\u00a0anyone other than your GP or epilepsy specialists\u00a0to reduce or stop taking your anti-epileptic medication and try alternative treatments. Withdrawing anti-epileptic medication without medical specialist supervision may result in seizures. \n Herbal remedies should also be used cautiously because some of their ingredients can interact with anti-epilepsy medication. St John\u2019s Wort, a herbal remedy used for mild depression, is not recommended for people with epilepsy because it can affect the blood levels of anti-epilepsy medication and may affect seizure control. \n For some people with epilepsy, stress can trigger seizures. Stress-relieving and relaxation therapies such as exercise,  yoga  and meditation may help.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Epilepsy is usually difficult to diagnose quickly. In most cases, it cannot be confirmed until you have had more than one seizure. \n It can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions, such as  migraines  and  panic attacks , can cause similar symptoms. \n If you have had a seizure, you will be referred to a specialist in epilepsy, normally a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system). \n Describing your seizures \n Some of the most important pieces of information needed to diagnose epilepsy are the details about your seizure or seizures. \n The doctor will ask you what you can remember\u00a0and any symptoms you may have had before it happened, such as\u00a0feeling strange before the seizure or experiencing any warning signs. It may be useful to talk to anyone who witnessed your seizure and ask them exactly what they saw, especially if you cannot remember the seizure. \n The doctor\u00a0will also ask about your medical and personal history and whether you\u00a0use any medicines, drugs or alcohol. \n The doctor\u00a0may be able to make a diagnosis of epilepsy from the information you give, but they might run further tests such as an\u00a0electroencephalogram (EEG) or  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . \n However, even if these tests don't show anything, it is still possible that you have epilepsy. \n Electroencephalogram (EEG) \n An EEG test can detect unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy by measuring\u00a0the electrical activity of your brain through electrodes placed on your scalp. \n During the test, you may be asked to breathe deeply or close your eyes and you may be asked to look at a flashing light.\u00a0The test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure. \n In some cases, an EEG may be carried out while you are asleep (sleep EEG)\u00a0or you may be given a small, portable EEG recording device to monitor your brain activity\u00a0over 24 hours (ambulatory EEG). \n Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \n An  MRI scan  is a type of scan which uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of your body. \n It can be useful in cases of suspected epilepsy because it can often detect possible causes of the condition,\u00a0such as defects in the structure of your brain or the presence of a brain tumour.\u00a0 \n An MRI scanner is a large tube that contains powerful magnets. You lie inside the tube during the scan."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Endometriosis", "introduction": "Endometriosis is a common condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb (the endometrium) is found outside the womb. \n These pieces of tissue can be found in many different areas of the body, including: \n \n the ovaries and fallopian tubes \n outside the womb \n the lining of the inside of the abdomen \n the bowel or bladder \n \n The condition\u00a0is estimated to affect around\u00a02 million women in the UK. Most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40. \n Endometriosis\u00a0is rare in women who have been through the menopause. \n Symptoms of endometriosis \n Endometriosis is a long-term (chronic) condition. Symptoms can vary significantly from person to person, and some women have no symptoms at all. \n The most common symptoms include: \n \n painful periods or heavy periods \n pain in the lower abdomen (tummy), pelvis or lower back \n pain during\u00a0and after\u00a0sex \n bleeding between periods \n difficulty getting pregnant \n \n Most women with endometriosis get pain in the area between their hips and the tops of their legs. Some women\u00a0experience this pain all the time. \n Other symptoms may include: \n \n persistent\u00a0exhaustion and tiredness \n discomfort when going to the toilet \n bleeding from your back passage (rectum)\u00a0or blood in your poo \n coughing blood\u00a0\u2013 in rare cases when\u00a0the endometriosis tissue is in the lung \n \n How severe the symptoms are depends on where in your body the abnormal tissue is, rather than the amount of tissue you have. A small amount could be more painful than a large amount. \n What causes endometriosis? \n The\u00a0causes of endometriosis aren't fully known, but there are several theories. \n The most\u00a0widely accepted\u00a0theory is the womb lining doesn't leave the body properly during a\u00a0period and embeds itself on the organs of the pelvis. This is known as retrograde menstruation. \n However, this doesn't explain why the condition can occur in women who have had a  hysterectomy . \n Read about the possible  causes of endometriosis  \n Diagnosing endometriosis \n See your GP if you have symptoms of endometriosis so they can try to identify a cause. They may refer\u00a0you to a gynaecologist, a specialist in problems affecting the female reproductive system. \n It can be difficult to diagnose endometriosis because the symptoms can vary considerably, and many other conditions can cause similar symptoms.\u00a0 \n Your gynaecologist will ask about your symptoms, your periods and possibly your sexual activity. They may also carry out an internal pelvic exam or\u00a0recommend an  ultrasound scan  to look for cysts in your ovaries that may have been caused by endometriosis. \n Laparoscopy \n Endometriosis can only be confirmed with a surgical examination called a\u00a0laparoscopy. This is carried out\u00a0under\u00a0 general anaesthetic  (where you're put to sleep) and you can usually go home the same day. \n A thin tube with a light on the end (laparoscope) will be passed into your body through a small cut\u00a0in your skin at your belly button.\u00a0It\u00a0has a tiny camera that transmits images to a video monitor so the specialist can see any endometriosis tissue. \n During the procedure,\u00a0a\u00a0small sample of tissue  (biopsy)  can be taken for laboratory testing, or\u00a0other surgical instruments can be inserted to treat the endometriosis.\u00a0 \n How endometriosis is treated \n The symptoms of endometriosis can often be managed\u00a0with painkillers and hormone medication, which help\u00a0prevent the condition interfering with your daily life. However,\u00a0there's no known cure for endometriosis. \n Patches of endometriosis tissue can sometimes be surgically removed to improve symptoms and fertility. \n Endometriosis can be a difficult condition to deal with, both physically and emotionally. Charities such as\u00a0 Endometriosis UK  can offer advice and support to help you cope. \n Read more\u00a0about  treating endometriosis  \n Endometriosis and pregnancy \n One of the main\u00a0complications of endometriosis is difficulty getting pregnant or not being able to get pregnant at all\u00a0 (infertility) . \n Although surgery can't guarantee you'll be able to get pregnant, there's good evidence that removing endometriosis tissue\u00a0with a laser or an electric current during keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery can improve your chances of having a successful pregnancy. \n If you have endometriosis and you do become pregnant, the condition is unlikely to put your pregnancy at risk. Pregnancy sometimes reduces the symptoms of endometriosis, although they often return once you've given birth and finished breastfeeding, and the menstrual cycle returns to normal. \n Read\u00a0more about the\u00a0 complications of endometriosis \u00a0and how\u00a0 how infertility is treated", "symptoms": "", "causes": "The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but there are several theories. \n Retrograde menstruation \n Retrograde menstruation\u00a0is when the womb lining (endometrium) flows backwards through the fallopian tubes and into the abdomen (tummy) instead of leaving the body as a period. This tissue then embeds itself on the organs of the pelvis and grows. \n It's thought retrograde menstruation happens in most women, but\u00a0many are able to clear the tissue naturally without it becoming a problem. \n Retrograde menstruation is the most commonly accepted theory for endometriosis. However, it doesn't explain why the condition can occur in women who have had a  hysterectomy . \n Genetics \n Endometriosis is sometimes believed to be hereditary, being passed down through the genes of family members. It's more common in the sisters and mothers of women who have endometriosis. \n It can affect women of every ethnicity, but is: \n \n less common in women of African-Caribbean origin \n more common in Asian women than in white women \n \n This suggests genes may play a part. \n Spread through the bloodstream or lymphatic system \n Although it's not known how, endometriosis cells are believed to get into the bloodstream or lymphatic system\u00a0(the immune system network of vessels and glands). \n This theory could explain how, in very rare cases, the cells are found in remote places such as the eyes or brain. \n Problems with the immune system \n It's believed some women's immune systems aren't able to fight off endometriosis effectively. Many women with endometriosis are\u00a0found to have lower immunity (resistance) to other conditions. However, this may be a result of the endometriosis, rather than the cause of the condition. \n Environmental causes \n It's thought endometriosis may be caused by certain toxins in the environment, such as dioxins, that affect the immune system and reproductive system. \n However, while research suggests there's a link between endometriosis and high levels of dioxin exposure in animals,\u00a0it's not currently known if this is also the case in humans. \n Metaplasia \n Metaplasia is the process of one type of cell changing into another to adapt to its environment. It's this development that allows the human body to grow in the womb before birth. \n It's been suggested some adult cells may retain this ability to change, and the shedding of menstrual blood into the pelvis during a period may stimulate them to transform into endometrial cells.", "treatment": "There is no cure for endometriosis and it can be difficult to treat. Treatment aims to ease symptoms so the condition doesn't interfere with your daily life. \n Treatment will be given to: \n \n relieve pain \n slow the growth of endometriosis tissue \n improve\u00a0 fertility  \n prevent the disease\u00a0returning \n \n Deciding which treatment \n Your gynaecologist will discuss the treatment options with you and outline the risks and benefits of each. \n When deciding which treatment is right for you, there are several things to\u00a0consider, including: \n \n your age \n whether your main symptom is pain or difficulty getting pregnant \n whether you want to become pregnant\u00a0\u2013 some treatments may stop you getting pregnant \n how you feel about surgery \n whether you've tried any of the treatments before \n \n Treatment may not be necessary if your symptoms are mild, you have no fertility problems, or if you're nearing the  menopause , when symptoms may get better without treatment. \n Endometriosis gets better by itself without treatment in about 3 in every 10 cases, but it becomes worse without treatment in about 4 in every 10 cases. One course of action is to keep an eye on symptoms and decide to have treatment if they get worse. \n Support from\u00a0 Endometriosis UK ,\u00a0can be very useful if you're learning how to manage the condition. \n Pain medication \n  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen  and naproxen,\u00a0are usually the preferred painkiller used to treat the pain associated with endometriosis. \n This is because they act against the swelling\u00a0(inflammation) caused by the condition, which may help ease pain and discomfort. It's best to take NSAIDs the day before\u00a0\u2013 or several days before\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you expect the period pain. \n  Paracetamol \u00a0can be used to treat mild pain. It's not usually as effective as NSAIDs, but may be used if\u00a0these types of drugs\u00a0cause any side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and  diarrhoea . \n Codeine\u00a0is a stronger painkiller that's sometimes combined with paracetamol or used alone if other painkillers aren't suitable. However,  constipation  is a common side effect, which may aggravate the symptoms of endometriosis. \n For more information, read the\u00a0Endometriosis UK\u00a0 factsheet on pain\u00a0relief for endometriosis  \n Hormone treatment \n The aim of hormone treatment is to limit or stop the production of oestrogen in your body. This is because oestrogen encourages endometriosis tissue to grow and shed. Without exposure to oestrogen, the endometriosis tissue can be reduced, which helps ease the symptoms. \n However, hormone treatment has no effect on adhesions\u00a0\u2013 \"sticky\" areas of tissue that can cause organs to fuse together\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and can't improve fertility. \n Read more about the\u00a0 complications of endometriosis  \n Some of the main\u00a0hormone-based treatments for endometriosis include: \n \n the combined oral\u00a0 contraceptive pill  or  contraceptive patch  \n a levonorgestrel-releasing\u00a0 intrauterine system  (LNG-IUS) \n gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues \n progestogens \n \n Evidence suggests these hormone treatments are equally effective\u00a0at treating endometriosis, but they have different side effects. \n Although most hormone treatments reduce your chance of pregnancy while using them, only the contraceptive pill or patch and LNG-IUS are licensed to be used as contraceptives. \n Progestogens and antiprogestogens are used less commonly these days\u00a0as they often cause unpleasant side effects. \n The combined oral contraceptive pill or patch \n The\u00a0combined contraceptive pill and contraceptive patch\u00a0contain the hormones oestrogen and progestogen.\u00a0They can help relieve milder symptoms and can be\u00a0used over long periods of time. They stop eggs being released (ovulation) and make periods lighter and less painful. \n These contraceptives can have side effects, but you can try different brands until you find one that suits you. Your doctor may recommend taking three packs of the pill in a row without a break to minimise the bleeding and improve any symptoms related to the bleeding. \n Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) \n The Mirena\u00a0levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a T-shaped contraceptive device that fits into the womb. It releases a type of progestogen hormone called levonorgestrel. \n This hormone\u00a0prevents the lining of your womb growing quickly, which can\u00a0help reduce pain and greatly reduces or even stops periods. \n The device is put into\u00a0the womb by a doctor or nurse. Once in place, it can remain effective for up to five years. \n Possible side effects of using LNG-IUS include irregular bleeding that may last more than six months, breast tenderness and  acne . \n Learn more about the  IUS  \n Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues \n GnRH analogues are synthetic hormones that bring on a temporary artificial menopause by reducing the production of oestrogen. They're usually taken as a nasal spray or injection. \n Menopause-like side effects of GnRH analogues include hot flushes, vaginal dryness and  low libido . Sometimes\u00a0low doses of\u00a0 hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  may be recommended in addition to GnRH analogues to prevent these side effects. \n They're only prescribed on a short-term basis (normally a maximum of six months at a time) and your symptoms may return after treatment is stopped. \n GnRH analogues aren't licensed as a form of contraception, so you should still use contraception in the first month while taking them until they take full effect. \n Examples of GnRH analogues include: \n \n buserelin \n goserelin \n nafarelin \n leuprorelin \n \n Progestogens \n Progestogens, such as\u00a0norethisterone,\u00a0are synthetic hormones that behave like the natural hormone progesterone. They\u00a0work by preventing the lining of your womb and\u00a0any endometriosis tissue growing quickly. \n However, they have side effects such as: \n \n bloating \n mood changes \n irregular bleeding \n weight gain \n \n Progestogens are\u00a0usually taken daily in tablet form from days 5 to 26 of your menstrual cycle, counting the first day of your period as day one. \n Progestogen tablets\u00a0aren't an effective form of contraception,\u00a0so you'll still need to use contraception while taking them if you don't want to get pregnant. \n Antiprogestogens \n Also known as testosterone derivatives, antiprogestogens are synthetic hormones that work in a similar way to GnRH analogues. They bring on a temporary artificial menopause by decreasing the production of oestrogen. \n Side effects of\u00a0antiprogestogens\u00a0can include: \n \n weight gain \n acne \n mood changes \n the development of masculine features such as hair growth and a deepening voice \n \n These side effects are often severe and alternative medications are more effective. This means antiprogestogens are usually only prescribed as a last resort if other medications haven't worked. \n Like GnRH analogues, antiprogestogens are usually only prescribed for a maximum of six months at a time. Examples of antiprogestogens include danazol and gestrinone. \n Surgery \n Surgery can be used to remove or destroy areas of endometriosis tissue, which can help improve symptoms and fertility. The kind of surgery you have will depend on where the tissue is. The options are: \n \n laparoscopy \u2013 the most commonly used and least invasive technique \n laparotomy \n hysterectomy \n \n Any surgical procedure carries risks. It's important to discuss these with your surgeon before undergoing treatment. \n Laparoscopy \n Laparoscopy, also known as keyhole surgery, is a common procedure used to treat endometriosis. Small cuts (incisions) are made in your tummy so the\u00a0endometriosis tissue can be destroyed or cut out. \n Large incisions can be avoided because the surgeon uses an instrument called a laparoscope. This is a small tube\u00a0with a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of your tummy or pelvis to a television monitor. \n During laparoscopy, fine instruments are used to apply heat, a laser, an electric current (diathermy) or a beam of special helium gas to the patches of tissue to destroy or remove them. \n The procedure\u00a0is carried out under  general anaesthetic , so you'll be\u00a0asleep and won't feel any pain as it's carried out. \n  Ovarian cysts ,\u00a0or endometriomas, which are formed as a result of endometriosis, can also be removed using this technique. \n Although this kind of surgery can relieve your symptoms and has been shown to improve fertility, problems can sometimes recur, especially if some endometriosis tissue is left behind. \n Laparotomy \n A laparotomy is a more\u00a0invasive\u00a0operation used if your endometriosis is severe and extensive, or if some of your organs\u00a0have fused\u00a0together. \n During the procedure, the surgeon makes a wide cut along the bikini line and opens up the area to access the affected organs and remove the endometriosis tissue. \n Recovery time for this type of surgery is longer than for keyhole surgery. \n Hysterectomy \n If keyhole surgery and other treatments haven't worked and you've decided not to have any more children, a  hysterectomy  (removal of the womb) can be an option. However, this is rarely required. \n A hysterectomy is a major operation that will have a significant impact on your body. Deciding to have a hysterectomy is a big decision that you should discuss with your GP or gynaecologist. \n Hysterectomies can't be reversed and, though unlikely, there's no guarantee the endometriosis symptoms won't return after the operation. If the ovaries are left in place, the endometriosis is more likely to return. \n If your ovaries are removed during a hysterectomy, the possibility of needing HRT afterwards should be discussed with you. However, it's\u00a0not clear what course of HRT is best for women who have endometriosis. \n For example, oestrogen-only HRT may cause your symptoms to return if any endometriosis patches remain after the operation. This risk is reduced by the use of a combined course of HRT (oestrogen and progesterone), but this can increase your risk of developing\u00a0 breast cancer . \n However, the risk of breast cancer isn't significantly increased until you've reached the normal age for the menopause. Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ectopic pregnancy", "introduction": "An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the fallopian tubes. \n The fallopian tubes are the tubes connecting the ovaries to the womb. If an egg gets stuck in them, it won't develop into a\u00a0baby and your health may be at risk if the pregnancy continues. \n Unfortunately, it's not possible to save the pregnancy. It usually has to be removed using medicine or an operation. \n In the UK, around 1 in every 80-90 pregnancies is ectopic. This is around 12,000 pregnancies a year. \n This page covers: \n  Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy  \n  When to get medical advice  \n  When to get emergency help  \n  How an ectopic pregnancy is treated  \n  Help and support after an ectopic pregnancy  \n  Trying for another baby  \n  What can cause an ectopic pregnancy?  \n Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy \n An ectopic pregnancy doesn't always cause symptoms and may only be detected during a routine pregnancy scan. \n If you do have symptoms, they tend to develop between the 4th and 12th week of pregnancy. \n Symptoms can include a combination of: \n \n a missed period and other\u00a0 signs of pregnancy  \n  tummy pain \u00a0low down on one side \n  vaginal bleeding \u00a0or a brown watery discharge \n pain in the tip of your shoulder \n discomfort when peeing or pooing \n \n However, these symptoms aren't necessarily a sign of a serious problem. They can sometimes be caused by other problems, such as a\u00a0 stomach bug . \n Read more about the  symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy  \n When to get medical advice \n Contact\u00a0your GP or the NHS 24 111 service\u00a0if you have a combination of any of the above symptoms and you might be pregnant \u2013 even if you haven't had a positive pregnancy test. \n An ectopic pregnancy can be serious, so it's important to get advice right away. \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms and you'll usually need to do a pregnancy test to\u00a0determine if you could have an ectopic pregnancy. \n You may be referred to a specialist early pregnancy clinic for further assessment, where an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  and\u00a0 blood tests  may be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. \n Read more about  ectopic pregnancy tests  \n When to get emergency help \n Call 999\u00a0for an ambulance or go to\u00a0your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department immediately if you experience a combination of: \n \n a sharp, sudden and intense pain in your tummy \n feeling\u00a0very dizzy or fainting \n feeling sick \n looking very pale \n \n These symptoms could mean that your fallopian tube has split open (ruptured). This is very serious and surgery to repair the fallopian tube needs to be carried out as soon as possible. \n A rupture can be life-threatening, but fortunately they're uncommon and treatable, if dealt with quickly. Deaths from ruptures are extremely rare in the UK. \n How an ectopic pregnancy is treated \n There are three main treatments for an ectopic pregnancy: \n \n expectant management \u2013 you're carefully monitored and one of the treatments below is used if the fertilised egg doesn't dissolve by itself \n medication \u2013 an injection of a powerful medicine called methotrexate is used to stop the pregnancy\u00a0growing \n surgery \u2013\u00a0keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) performed under\u00a0 general anaesthetic  is used to remove the fertilised egg,\u00a0usually along with the affected fallopian tube \n \n You'll be told\u00a0about the benefits and risks of each option. In many cases,\u00a0a particular treatment will be recommended based on your symptoms and the results of the tests you have. \n Some treatments may reduce your chances of being able to conceive naturally in the future, although most women will still be able to get pregnant (see below). Talk to your doctor about this. \n Read more about  treating an ectopic pregnancy  \n Help and support after an ectopic pregnancy \n Losing a pregnancy can be devastating and many women feel the same sense of grief as if they had lost a family member or partner. \n It's not uncommon for these feelings to last several months, although they usually improve with time. Make sure you give yourself and your partner time to grieve. \n If you or your partner are struggling to come to terms with your loss, you may benefit from professional support or counselling. Speak to your GP about this. \n Support groups for people who have been affected by loss of a pregnancy can also help. These include: \n \n  The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust  \n The  Miscarriage Association  \n  Cruse Bereavement Care  \n \n Read more about\u00a0 dealing with loss \u00a0 \n Trying for another baby \n You may want to try for another baby when you and your partner feel physically and emotionally ready. \n You'll probably be advised to wait until you've had at least two periods after treatment before trying again, to allow yourself to recover. If you were treated with methotrexate, it's usually recommended that you wait at least three months, because the medicine could harm your baby if you become pregnant during this time. \n Most women who have had an ectopic pregnancy will be able to get pregnant again, even if they've had a fallopian tube removed. Overall, 65% of women achieve a successful pregnancy within 18 months of an ectopic pregnancy. Occasionally, it may be necessary to use fertility treatment such as\u00a0 IVF . \n The chances of having another ectopic pregnancy are higher if you've had one before, but the risk is still small (around 10%). \n If you do become pregnant again, it's a good idea to let your GP know as soon as possible, so early scans can be carried out to check everything's OK. \n What can cause an ectopic pregnancy? \n In many cases, it's not clear why a woman has an ectopic pregnancy. Sometimes it happens when there's a problem with the fallopian tubes, such as them being narrow or blocked. \n The following are all associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy: \n \n pelvic inflammatory disease\u00a0(PID) \u2013 inflammation of the female reproductive system, usually caused by a\u00a0 sexually transmitted infection (STI)  \n previous ectopic pregnancy \u2013 the risk of having another ectopic pregnancy is around 10% \n previous surgery on your fallopian tubes \u2013 such as an unsuccessful\u00a0 female sterilisation  procedure \n fertility treatment, such as IVF \u2013 taking medication to stimulate ovulation (the release of an egg) can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy \n becoming\u00a0pregnant while using an  intrauterine device (IUD)  or  intrauterine system (IUS)  for contraception \u2013 it's rare to get pregnant while using these, but if you do you're more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy \n smoking \n increasing age \u2013 the risk is highest for pregnant women who are aged 35-40 \n \n You can't always prevent an ectopic pregnancy, but you can reduce your risk by using a\u00a0 condom  when not trying for a baby, to protect yourself from STIs, and by  stopping smoking", "symptoms": "Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy usually develop between the 4th and 12th weeks of pregnancy. \n Some women don't have any symptoms at first. They may not find out they have an ectopic pregnancy\u00a0until an early scan shows the problem or they develop more serious symptoms later on. \n Main symptoms \n You may have an ectopic pregnancy if you miss a period, have a positive pregnancy test\u00a0and/or have other\u00a0 signs of pregnancy , in addition to any of the symptoms listed below. \n Contact your GP or the NHS 24 111\u00a0service\u00a0if you have a combination of any of these symptoms and you think you might be pregnant \u2013 even if you haven't had a positive pregnancy test. \n Vaginal bleeding \n Vaginal bleeding\u00a0tends to\u00a0a bit different to your regular period. It often starts and stops, and\u00a0may be\u00a0watery and dark brown in colour. \n Some women mistake this bleeding for a\u00a0regular period\u00a0and don't realise they're pregnant. \n  Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy \u00a0is relatively common and isn't necessarily a sign of a serious problem, but you should seek medical advice\u00a0if you experience it. \n Tummy pain \n You may experience  tummy pain , typically low down on\u00a0one side. It can develop suddenly or gradually, and may be persistent or come and go. \n Tummy pain can have lots of causes, including\u00a0 stomach bugs  and trapped wind, so it doesn't necessarily mean you have an ectopic pregnancy. But you should get medical advice if you have\u00a0it and\u00a0think you might be pregnant. \n Shoulder tip pain \n Shoulder tip pain is an unusual pain felt where your shoulder ends and your arm begins. \n It's not known exactly why it occurs, but it can be a sign\u00a0of an ectopic pregnancy causing some internal bleeding, so you should get medical advice right away if you experience it. \n Discomfort when going to the toilet \n You may\u00a0experience pain when going for a pee or poo. You may also have  diarrhoea . \n Some changes to your normal bladder and bowel patterns are normal during pregnancy, and these symptoms can be caused by\u00a0 urinary tract infections  and stomach bugs. However, it's still a good idea to seek medical advice if you experience\u00a0these symptoms\u00a0and think you might be pregnant. \n Symptoms of a rupture \n In a few cases, an ectopic pregnancy can grow large enough to split open the fallopian tube. This is known as a rupture. \n Ruptures are very serious and surgery to repair the fallopian tube needs to be carried out as soon as possible. \n Signs of a rupture include a combination of: \n \n a sharp, sudden and intense pain in your tummy \n feeling very dizzy or fainting \n feeling sick \n looking very pale \n \n Phone 999 for an ambulance or go to\u00a0 your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department  immediately if you experience these symptoms.", "causes": "", "treatment": "Unfortunately, the baby cannot be saved in an ectopic pregnancy. Treatment is usually needed to remove the pregnancy before it grows too large. \n The main treatment options are: \n \n  expectant management \u00a0\u2013\u00a0your condition is carefully monitored to see whether treatment is necessary \n  medication \u00a0\u2013 a medicine called methotrexate is used to stop the pregnancy growing\u00a0 \n  surgery \u00a0\u2013 surgery is used to remove the pregnancy,\u00a0usually along with the affected fallopian tube \n \n These options each have advantages and disadvantages that your doctor will discuss with you. \n They'll recommend what they think is the most suitable option for you, depending on factors such as your symptoms, the size of the pregnancy and the level of pregnancy hormone (human\u00a0chorionic gonadotropin or hCG) in your blood. \n Expectant management \n If\u00a0you have no symptoms or mild symptoms and the pregnancy is very small or can't be found, you may only need to be closely monitored, because\u00a0there's a good chance the pregnancy will dissolve by itself. \n This is known as expectant management and the following is likely to happen:\u00a0 \n \n You'll have regular blood tests to check that the level of hCG in your blood is going down\u00a0\u2013 these will be needed until the hormone is no longer found. \n You may need one of the treatments outlined below if\u00a0your hormone level doesn't go down or it increases. \n You'll usually have some vaginal bleeding\u00a0\u2013 use sanitary pads or towels, rather than tampons, until this clears up. \n You may experience some tummy pain\u00a0\u2013 take\u00a0 paracetamol  to relieve this. \n You'll be told what to do if you develop more severe symptoms. \n \n The main advantage of monitoring is that you won't experience any side effects of treatment. A disadvantage is that there's still a small risk of your fallopian tubes splitting open (rupturing) and you may eventually need treatment. \n Medication \n If an ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed early but active monitoring isn't suitable, treatment with a medicine called methotrexate may be recommended. \n This\u00a0works by stopping the pregnancy from growing and is given as a single injection into your buttocks. \n You won't need to stay in hospital\u00a0after treatment, but regular blood tests will be\u00a0carried out\u00a0to check if the treatment is working. A second dose is sometimes needed and surgery (see below) may be necessary if it doesn't work. \n You need to use reliable\u00a0 contraception  for at least three months after treatment, because methotrexate can be harmful for a baby if you become pregnant during this time. \n It's also important to avoid alcohol until you're told it's safe, as drinking soon after receiving a dose of methotrexate can damage your liver. \n Other side effects of\u00a0methotrexate include: \n \n tummy pain\u00a0\u2013 this is usually mild and should pass within a day or two \n dizziness \n feeling and being sick \n  diarrhoea  \n \n There's also a chance of your fallopian tubes rupturing after treatment. You'll be told what to look out for and what\u00a0to do if you think this has happened. \n Surgery \n In most cases,\u00a0keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) will be carried out to remove the pregnancy before it\u00a0becomes too large. \n During a laparoscopy: \n \n you're given\u00a0 general anaesthetic , so you're asleep while it's carried out \n small cuts (incisions) are made in your tummy \n a thin viewing tube (laparoscope) and small surgical instruments are inserted\u00a0through the\u00a0incisions \n the\u00a0entire fallopian tube containing the\u00a0pregnancy is removed if your other fallopian tube looks healthy\u00a0\u2013 otherwise, removing the pregnancy without removing the whole tube may be attempted \n \n Removing the affected fallopian tube\u00a0is the most effective treatment and isn't thought to reduce your chances of becoming pregnant again. Your doctor will discuss this with you beforehand and you'll be asked whether you consent to having\u00a0the tube removed. \n Most women can leave hospital a few days after surgery, although it can take four to six weeks to\u00a0fully recover. \n If your fallopian tube has already ruptured, you'll need emergency surgery. The surgeon will make a larger incision in your\u00a0tummy (laparotomy)\u00a0to stop the bleeding and repair your fallopian tube, if that is possible. \n After either type of surgery,\u00a0a treatment called\u00a0anti-D rhesus prophylaxis will be given\u00a0if your blood type is RhD negative (see\u00a0 blood groups  for more information). This involves an injection of a medicine that helps to prevent rhesus disease in future pregnancies.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It can be difficult to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy from the symptoms alone, as they can be similar to other conditions. \n Your GP may examine you and offer a pregnancy test. If you have the  symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy  and a positive pregnancy test, you may be referred to an early pregnancy assessment service for further testing. \n Some of the tests you may have are outlined below. \n Vaginal ultrasound \n An ectopic pregnancy is usually diagnosed by carrying out a transvaginal  ultrasound scan . \n This involves inserting a small probe\u00a0into your vagina. The probe is so small that it is easy to insert and you won't need a local anaesthetic. The probe emits sound waves that bounce back to create a close-up image of your reproductive system on a monitor. \n This will often show whether a fertilised egg has become implanted in one of your fallopian tubes, although occasionally it may be very difficult to spot. \n Blood tests \n  Blood tests \u00a0to measure the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may also be carried out twice,\u00a048 hours apart,\u00a0to see how the level changes over time. \n This can be a\u00a0useful way of identifying ectopic pregnancies that aren't found during an ultrasound scan, as the level of hCG tends to be lower and rise more slowly over time than in a normal pregnancy. \n The results of the\u00a0test can also be useful in determining the best treatment for an ectopic pregnancy. \n Read more about  how an ectopic pregnancy is treated  \n Keyhole surgery \n If it's still not clear whether you have an ectopic pregnancy, or the location of the pregnancy is unknown, a\u00a0laparoscopy may be carried out. \n This is a type of keyhole surgery carried out under\u00a0 general anaesthetic  (where you're asleep) that involves making a small cut (incision) in your tummy and inserting a viewing tube called\u00a0a laparoscope. \n Your doctor uses the laparoscope to examine the\u00a0womb and fallopian tubes directly. \n If an ectopic pregnancy is found during the procedure, small surgical instruments may be used to remove it, to avoid the possible need for a second operation later on. \n Read more about  surgery for an ectopic pregnancy"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ebola virus disease", "introduction": "Ebola virus disease is a serious illness that originated in Africa, where a large outbreak occurred in 2014-15.\u00a0In June 2016, the outbreak was officially declared over. \n The 2014-15 outbreak of Ebola mainly affected three countries in west Africa: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some cases also occurred in parts of central Africa. \n Around 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths were reported by the  World Health Organization . This was the largest known outbreak of Ebola. \n \u00a0 \n  Is \u00a0Ebola still a risk? \n There's still a small chance occasional cases of Ebola may occur in Africa as the virus is present in several countries there, but the risk for people travelling to Africa is minimal. \n The\u00a0 Foreign and Commonwealth Office  no longer advises against all but essential travel to previously affected areas. \n People who remain most at risk are those who care for infected people or handle their blood or fluid, such as hospital workers, laboratory workers and family members. \n To find out what the health risks are for an area you're planning to visit, check the\u00a0 NHS Fit for Travel destination guide ,  Travel Health Pro country information \u00a0or  GOV.UK foreign travel advice . \n The risk of an Ebola outbreak occurring in the UK remains negligible. \n  Symptoms \u00a0of Ebola \n A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop: \n \n a high temperature (fever) \n a\u00a0 headache  \n joint and muscle pain \n a\u00a0 sore throat  \n severe muscle weakness \n \n These symptoms start suddenly between\u00a02 and 21 days after becoming infected. \n  Diarrhoea ,  vomiting , a rash,\u00a0 stomach pain  and reduced kidney and liver function can follow. The person may then bleed internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth. \n  What \u00a0to do if you become ill \n Get medical advice as soon as possible if you become ill while travelling abroad. Call the\u00a0NHS 24 '111' service\u00a0or contact your GP if you become ill after returning to the UK. \n It's extremely unlikely you have Ebola, but it could be another serious condition such as\u00a0cholera or\u00a0 malaria , so it's a good idea to get help in case you need tests or treatment. \n Always remember to mention your recent travel history, as this will help identify what the problem could be. \n Sometimes your doctor may want to take a sample of your blood, urine or stools so it can be checked for any infections. \n  How \u00a0Ebola virus is spread \n The Ebola virus is spread in the blood, body fluids or organs of a person or animal with the infection. \n For example, it can be spread by: \n \n directly touching the body of someone with the infection who has symptoms or\u00a0recently died \u2013 the virus can survive for several days outside the body \n cleaning up body fluids (blood, stools, urine or vomit) or touching the soiled clothing of an infected person \n handling unsterilised needles or medical equipment used in the care of the infected person \n having sex with an infected person without using a condom \u2013 studies show traces of Ebola may remain in a man's semen many months after he has recovered \n handling or eating raw or undercooked \"bushmeat\" \n \n Ebola can't be caught through routine social contact, such as shaking hands, with people who don't have symptoms. \n  Treatment \u00a0for Ebola \n There's currently no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola, although potential new vaccines and drug therapies are being developed and tested. \n Any area affected by an outbreak should be immediately quarantined, and people confirmed to have the infection should be treated in isolation in intensive care. \n  Dehydration \u00a0is common, so fluids may be given directly into a vein. Blood oxygen levels and blood pressure also need to be maintained at the right level, and body organs supported while the person's body fights the infection. \n Healthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions, such as wearing protective equipment. \n Ebola virus disease is sometimes\u00a0fatal. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chance they'll survive. \n  Preventing \u00a0Ebola \n The Ebola outbreak in west Africa is now over. The risk of catching the infection while travelling to previously affected countries is very small. \n But if you're visiting one of these areas, it's still a good idea to follow these simple precautions to minimise your risk of picking up potentially serious infections: \n \n wash your hands frequently using soap and water \u2013 use alcohol hand rubs when soap isn't available \n make sure fruit and vegetables are properly washed and peeled before you eat them \n avoid physical contact with anyone who has possible symptoms of an infection \n don't handle dead animals or their raw meat \n don't eat \"bushmeat\" \n \n You can check the advice for an area you're planning to visit using the\u00a0 NHS Fit for Travel destination guide ,  Travel Health Pro country information \u00a0or  GOV.UK foreign travel advice .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Earwax build-up", "introduction": "Earwax is produced inside your ears to keep them clean and free of germs. It usually passes out of the ears harmlessly, but sometimes too much can build up and block the ears. \n A build-up of earwax is a common problem that can often be treated using eardrops bought from a pharmacy. \n If pharmacy treatment doesn't work, contact your GP surgery. They may suggest having your ears washed out. \n If these treatments don't help, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) department for specialised treatment. \n What can cause an earwax build-up? \n Some people regularly get blocked ears because they naturally produce a lot of earwax. \n Other factors that can increase the risk of too much earwax include: \n \n producing naturally hard or dry earwax \n having narrow or hairy ear canals (the tube between the opening of the ear and the eardrum) \n being elderly, as earwax becomes drier with age \n bony growths in the outer part of the ear canal \n \n Earwax can also block your ear if you frequently insert objects into your ear canal, such as cotton buds, ear plugs or\u00a0 hearing aids . \n Symptoms of an earwax build-up \n A build-up of earwax in your ear can cause: \n \n  earache  \n  hearing loss  \n  tinnitus  (hearing sounds from inside your body) \n  itchiness  in or around the ear \n  vertigo  (a spinning sensation) \n  ear infections  \n \n These\u00a0problems will usually improve once the excess earwax has been removed. \n What to do if you think your ear is blocked \n Don't try to remove a build-up of earwax yourself with your fingers, a cotton bud or any other object. This can damage your ear and push the wax further down. \n If the earwax is only causing minor problems, you can try buying some eardrops from a pharmacy. These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally. \n There are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing sodium bicarbonate, olive oil or almond oil. \n However, eardrops aren't suitable for everyone and\u00a0some can\u00a0irritate the skin. For example, eardrops shouldn't be used\u00a0if you have a perforated eardrum\u00a0(a hole or tear in\u00a0your eardrum). \n Speak to your pharmacist about the most suitable product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it. \n When to see your GP \n Contact your GP surgery if you have particularly troublesome symptoms or eardrops haven't helped after three to five days. \n Your GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they're blocked and might carry out some simple hearing tests. \n They may suggest using eardrops for a bit longer, or they may carry out a minor procedure called ear irrigation to clean out your ear canal. \n If these treatments aren't suitable or don't help, your GP may refer you to the ENT department of your nearest hospital for more specialised treatments such as microsuction or an aural toilet. \n Treatments to remove earwax \n There are several different earwax removal treatments available. \n The main treatments are: \n \n eardrops \u2013 drops\u00a0used several times a day for a few days to soften the earwax so that it falls out by itself \n ear irrigation \u2013 a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump is used to push water into your ear and wash the earwax out \n microsuction \u2013 a quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of your ear \n aural toilet \u2013 where a thin instrument with a small\u00a0hoop at one end is used to clean your ear and scrape out the earwax \n \n Not all these treatments are suitable for everyone. Your pharmacist or doctor can let you know what treatments may work for you and they can tell you about any associated risks or side effects. \n Preventing an earwax build-up \n Some people are naturally prone to earwax building up in their ears and may need frequent treatment to remove it when it becomes a problem. \n It's not clear if there's anything you can do to\u00a0stop earwax blocking your ears, although some doctors recommend using eardrops regularly to keep your earwax soft. \n Don't try to scrape out the earwax with your finger or an object inserted into your ear, as this this can make the problem worse. \n Speak to your doctor for advice if earwax builds up in your ears regularly.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Dystonia", "introduction": "Dystonia is a medical term for a range of movement disorders that cause muscle spasms and contractions. \n The spasms and contractions may either be sustained or may come and go. \n Movements\u00a0are\u00a0often\u00a0repetitive and cause unusual, awkward and sometimes painful postures.\u00a0Tremor (shaking) can also be a characteristic of some types of dystonia. \n Dystonia is thought to be a neurological condition (caused by underlying problems with the brain and nervous system). However,\u00a0in most cases, brain functions such as intelligence, memory and language remain unaffected. \n Types of dystonia \n Dystonia can affect only one muscle or a group of muscles. There are five main types of dystonia: \n \n Focal dystonia \u2013 where a single region, such as the hand or eyes,\u00a0is affected. Cervical dystonia, blepharospasm (abnormal twitch of the eyelid), laryngeal dystonia and writer's cramp are all examples of focal dystonia.\u00a0If it only affects someone during specific activities, such as writing, it's described as task-specific dystonia. \n Segmental dystonia \u2013 where two or more connected regions of the body are affected. Cranial dystonia (blepharospasm affecting the lower face and\u00a0jaw or tongue) is an example.\u00a0 \n Multifocal dystonia \u2013 where two or more regions of the body that aren't connected to each other, such as the left arm and left leg, are affected.\u00a0 \n Generalised dystonia \u2013 where the trunk and at least two other parts of the body are affected. The legs may or may not be affected.\u00a0 \n Hemidystonia \u2013 where one entire side of the body is affected.\u00a0 \n \n About 90% of all cases are either cervical dystonia (which affects the neck muscles) or blepharospasm (which affects the eyelids). These are both focal dystonias that tend to develop later in life. They don\u2019t usually get any worse and no other muscles are affected. \n Read more about the  symptoms of dystonia . \n Causes of dystonia \n Exactly how dystonia develops remains uncertain, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain that controls muscle movement (the basal ganglia). \n If there's no identifiable cause of dystonia, or if the cause is genetic, it's described as primary dystonia. \n Secondary dystonia is where dystonia\u00a0occurs as a symptom of an underlying condition or injury. Common causes include  stroke ,  brain injury , encephalitis\u00a0and  Parkinson\u2019s disease . \n Read more about the  causes of dystonia . \n Diagnosing dystonia \n Dystonia is diagnosed by a specialist examining and recognising the typical symptoms. The type of dystonia is then classified by which area of the body is affected. \n When diagnosing dystonia, it's important to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia, because this may determine the type of treatment you need. \n If you have typical signs of late-onset focal dystonia, specific investigations may not be required. However, tests may be needed to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia. These may include brain scans, urine or\u00a0 blood tests , and genetic testing. \n Read more about  how dystonia is diagnosed . \n Treating dystonia \n There's no cure for dystonia, but\u00a0the condition can usually be effectively managed.\u00a0 \n Treatment will vary, depending on the type of dystonia you have and the precise nature of your symptoms. However, the four main types of treatment are: \n \n botulinum toxin \u2013 widely used to treat neurological conditions that involve abnormal muscle contractions, such as dystonia; it's injected into the affected muscles to temporarily weaken them and reduce spasms \n medication \u2013 such as anticholinergics, Baclofen and muscle relaxants \n physiotherapy\u00a0\u2013 where exercises are used to improve range of motion and\u00a0posture, and prevent muscle weakness \n surgery \u2013 if other treatments are unsuccessful, the nerves controlling\u00a0the muscles\u00a0causing spasms can be cut (selective peripheral denervation), or electrodes can be implanted within the brain, which are connected to a small device that's similar to a pacemaker (deep brain stimulation) \n \n Read more about  how dystonia is treated . \n Outlook \n Dystonia is an unpredictable condition. It tends to progress slowly and the severity of a person's symptoms can vary from one day to another. \n Focal dystonia usually progresses gradually over a period of about\u00a0five years and then doesn't get any worse. \n Sometimes, a person's symptoms improve or disappear completely.\u00a0This is known as total\u00a0remission and it's thought to occur in around 5-10% of people. \n Total remission is more likely in cases of secondary dystonia, such as dystonia that occurs after a  stroke . If someone has another underlying condition, such as  Parkinson\u2019s disease , the\u00a0symptoms of dystonia are more likely to last for the rest of their lives. \n Who\u00a0is affected by\u00a0dystonia? \n Dystonia is generally uncommon, although\u00a0it's one of the more common neurological conditions. \n Dystonia can\u00a0affect men, women and children. It can be difficult to diagnose, and there may be many people with the\u00a0condition who remain undiagnosed. \n  The Dystonia Society \u00a0estimates that at least 70,000 people are affected by dystonia in the UK. At least 8,000 of these\u00a0are children and young people.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of dystonia can vary, depending on the type of dystonia and when it develops. \n In early-onset dystonia, the symptoms begin during childhood or early adulthood. Symptoms usually start in the\u00a0legs or arms, before spreading to other limbs and sometimes the upper part of the body. \n Dystonia that starts\u00a0as an adult (late-onset) usually begins\u00a0in the head, neck or one of the arms, and doesn't progress to affect other parts of the body. \n Early-onset dystonia \n Generalised dystonia \n Generalised dystonia often begins around the time a child reaches puberty. The symptoms usually begin in one of the limbs, before spreading to other parts of the body. \n Symptoms of generalised dystonia can include: \n \n muscle spasms \n having an abnormal, twisted posture \n a foot, leg or arm turning inwards \n body parts jerking rapidly \n \n Dopa-responsive dystonia \n Dopa-responsive dystonia is a type of generalised dystonia. \n The symptoms of this type of dystonia usually begin during childhood, between the ages of 6 and 16 years. The most common symptom is an abnormal, stiff way of walking. The sole of the foot can bend upwards or the foot may turn outwards at the ankle. \n Some people with dopa-responsive dystonia may also have muscle stiffness and spasms in their arms and torso. \n Myoclonus dystonia \n Myoclonus dystonia is a rare type of segmental dystonia that affects the muscles in the arms, neck and torso. \n Segmental dystonia affects two or more connected parts of the body. It causes sudden \"jerk-like\" spasms (myoclonus) that are similar to the spasms someone has when they get an electric shock. \n Paroxysmal dystonia \n Paroxysmal dystonia is a rare type of dystonia, where muscle spasms and unusual body movements only occur at certain times. The sudden onset of symptoms is known as an attack. \n The symptoms of paroxysmal dystonia can be similar to\u00a0the symptoms of an epileptic fit. However, during an attack, only your muscles will be affected. Unlike  epilepsy , you won't lose consciousness and you'll remain fully aware of your surroundings. Attacks can last from a few minutes to several hours. \n Certain situations or substances can trigger an attack of paroxysmal dystonia, including: \n \n  stress \u00a0 \n fatigue \n alcohol \n coffee \n sudden movement \n \n Late-onset dystonia \n Cervical dystonia \n Cervical dystonia, also known as torticollis, is the most common form of dystonia. It's a type of focal dystonia (where only one body part is affected) that affects the neck muscles. \n Involuntary contractions and spasms in the neck muscles can range from mild to severe and cause your head and neck to twist or be pulled forwards, backwards or from side to side. \n Muscle spasms and contractions often cause\u00a0neck pain and stiffness. \n The symptoms of cervical dystonia can sometimes be relieved by touching your chin, neck or the back of your head. The reasons for this are unclear. \n Blepharospasm \n Blepharospasm is a type of focal dystonia that causes the muscles around your eyes to spasm involuntarily. \n Uncontrollable eye closure is a common characteristic of blepharospasm. In the most severe cases, a person may be unable to open their eyes for several minutes, effectively making them blind for short periods of time. \n Frequent blinking, eye irritation and sensitivity to light (photophobia) are also possible characteristics of blepharospasm. \n If you have blepharospasm, the pattern of your symptoms can change throughout the day. For example, you may have few or no symptoms when you wake up in the morning, but they may start to appear or get worse when you're tired or stressed. \n Hemifacial spasm \n Although it\u00a0isn't considered to be a dystonia, hemifacial spasm can cause similar symptoms, with repetitive twitching of the muscles on one side of the face, usually around the eyes and mouth. It can respond well to botulinum toxin injections. \n Laryngeal dystonia \n Laryngeal dystonia is a type of focal dystonia that causes the muscles of the voice box (larynx)\u00a0to spasm. Your voice can either sound \"strangled\" or\u00a0very quiet and \"breathy\",\u00a0depending on whether the muscles of your larynx spasm outwards or inwards. \n Writer\u2019s cramp \n Writer\u2019s cramp,\u00a0also known as task-specific dystonia, is a type of focal dystonia that causes cramps and\u00a0involuntary movements in the muscles of the arm and wrist. This makes handwriting difficult and uncomfortable. \n As the name suggests, writer\u2019s cramp usually affects people who do a lot of writing. Other less well-known types of task-specific dystonia include: \n \n musician\u2019s cramp \n golfer\u2019s cramp \n typist\u2019s cramp \n \n As in other types of late-onset dystonias,\u00a0tremor (shaking) may also be a prominent feature.\u00a0 \n Oromandibular dystonia \n Oromandibular dystonia is a type of segmental dystonia that affects the lower facial muscles, tongue or jaw. \n It can cause a number of different facial distortions, including grimacing and lip pursing. The jaw can repeatedly open and close or pull outwards and upwards. Tongue movements can be continuous or occur intermittently. \n In some cases, the symptoms of oromandibular dystonia only occur when your mouth is being used, such as while eating\u00a0or talking. In other cases, the symptoms may be improved by talking or chewing. \n If you have oromandibular dystonia, you may also have  difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) .", "causes": "Dystonia with no obvious cause, or caused by a genetic mutation, is known as primary dystonia. If dystonia is a symptom of another condition, it's known as secondary dystonia. \n Primary dystonia \n Most people with primary dystonia don't have an identified cause. A minority of cases are associated with genetic mutations, which usually begin in childhood. \n There are currently over 12 types (or sub-types) of dystonia linked to genetic mutations, including generalised dystonia, dopa-responsive dystonia and paroxysmal dystonia. \n Read more about the  different types of dystonia . \n The genes responsible for these types of dystonia are passed down through families in a pattern that's known as autosomal dominant. This means if you have one of these abnormal genes, there's a one in two chance your children will inherit that gene and develop dystonia. \n Secondary dystonia \n Secondary dystonia, also known as acquired dystonia, can have a wide range of causes, including: \n \n  Parkinson\u2019s disease  \u2013 a neurological condition caused by the lack of a neurotransmitter called dopamine \n  Huntington\u2019s disease  \u2013 a genetic condition that\u00a0can lead to psychiatric problems and difficulties with behaviour, feeding, communication and abnormal movements \n Wilson\u2019s disease \u2013 a genetic condition that leads to a build-up of copper in the body\u2019s tissues \n  multiple sclerosis  \u2013 a condition caused by damage to the nervous system \n cerebral palsy \u2013 a condition caused by brain damage that occurs before or soon after birth \n certain medications \u2013 such as antipsychotics (used to treat certain mental health conditions) or anticonvulsants (used to treat  epilepsy ) which\u00a0can cause dystonia in a small number of people \n infections \u2013 such as\u00a0 HIV  or\u00a0encephalitis\u00a0 \n injury \u2013 to the skull or spine \n  brain tumours  \n  stroke  \u2013 a serious medical condition, where the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off \n poisoning \u2013 such as carbon monoxide poisoning", "treatment": "There are a number of treatment techniques that can control the involuntary movements and spasms of dystonia, including medication, physiotherapy, and in some cases, surgery. \n The aim is to provide relief from the abnormal movements and postures of dystonia, plus any associated pain and discomfort. \n In some cases, other conditions that arise as a result of dystonia, such as\u00a0stress, anxiety or depression,\u00a0may also need to be treated. \n Treatment for dystonia should be based on the individual and their specific needs.\u00a0As different people respond differently to different treatments, it may be necessary to try several options to find out which one works best. \n There are four main types of treatment for dystonia. They are: \n \n botulinum toxin \n medication \n physiotherapy \n surgery, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) \n \n Wherever possible, physiotherapy, medication or botulinum medication will be used to treat dystonia rather than surgery, particularly in the case of children and young people. \n Each type of treatment is discussed in more detail below. \n Botulinum toxin \n Since being introduced into clinical practice in the late 1980s, botulinum toxin has become an effective and widely used form of treatment for a number of different neurological conditions that involve abnormal muscle contractions, such as dystonia. \n It's given by injection directly into the affected muscles and works by blocking the neurotransmitters responsible for muscle spasms reaching the affected muscles. \n The effects of the injection usually last two to three months, after which time you'll need another injection. The site of the injection may feel painful for a few days, but this should soon pass. \n Other side effects of botulinum toxin will depend on which part of your body is injected. For example, injections: \n \n in the neck area may cause swallowing difficulties ( dysphagia ) \n around the eyes may lead to drooping of the eyes and double vision \n in the vocal cord may cause your voice to become soft and \"breathy\" \n \n These types of side effects should pass after about a week. \n Medication \n There are a number of different medications that can be used to treat dystonia.\u00a0 \n Anticholinergics \n Anticholinergics are a type of medication that can be used to effectively treat all types of dystonia. \n However, they're mainly used to treat generalised dystonia, because botulinum toxin now tends to be used to treat focal dystonia and segmental dystonia (see below). \n Anticholinergics work by blocking the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, known to cause muscle spasms in some cases of dystonia. Trihexyphenidyl and\u00a0procyclidine are two examples of anticholinergics.\u00a0 \n Side effects of anticholinergics include: \n \n  dry mouth  \n  constipation  \n difficulties urinating \n blurred vision \n memory problems \n confusion \n \n Baclofen \n Baclofen is a medication that's sometimes used to treat spasticity (excessive muscular tension) caused by\u00a0 stroke  or  multiple sclerosis . However, it\u2019s also helps in treating people with dystonia. \n In particular, daily doses of baclofen are effective in treating people with segmental and generalised dystonia, as well as those with oromandibular dystonia. \n Common side effects of Baclofen include: \n \n kidney problems \u2013 seek medical advice if you develop symptoms such as sleepiness or lethargy (lack of energy) \n nausea \u2013 this may be reduced by taking Baclofen with food or milk \n drowsinesss \n balance and co-ordination problems \n confusion \n \n Muscle relaxants \n Muscle relaxants are sometimes used to treat cases of dystonia that fail to respond to other types of medication. They\u00a0work by increasing the levels of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps to relax affected muscles. \n Diazepam, lorazepam and\u00a0clonazepam are all types of muscle relaxants that may be used to treat dystonia. \n Depending on the pattern of your symptoms, muscle relaxants can be given by injection (intravenously) or in tablet form (orally). Side effects of muscle relaxants include: \n \n drowsiness \n tiredness \n muscle weakness \n dizziness \n impaired co-ordination \n \n These side effects should be temporary and disappear once your body gets used to the medication. If you have symptoms of dizziness, avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. \n Don't suddenly stop taking muscle relaxants. If you do, you'll experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sweating or\u00a0tremors (shaking). \n If your care team decides you should stop taking muscle relaxants, your dose will gradually be reduced. \n Physiotherapy \n Physiotherapy uses specific exercises to help you maintain a full range of motion, improve your posture and prevent the shortening or weakening of affected muscles. \n Some people with dystonia find their symptoms improve by simply touching the affected body part or a nearby area. This is known as a \"sensory trick\" or \"geste antagoniste\". \n For example, people with cervical dystonia (where the neck muscles spasm and tighten) often find their symptoms improve by touching the back of their head or the side of their face. \n Pain management \n Many people with certain types\u00a0of\u00a0dystonia experience pain, caused by spasms or repeated twisting of joints. You may be referred to a pain management programme to help with managing chronic pain. \n Speech and language therapy \n You may be referred to a speech and language therapist for certain types of dystonia, such as laryngeal dystonia,\u00a0which causes difficulty speaking. \n Surgery \n Surgery may be recommended if your\u00a0 dystonia symptoms \u00a0don't respond to botulinum toxin, medication or physiotherapy. \n Deep brain stimulation (DBS) \n Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a type of brain surgery used to treat dystonia. During surgery, two small holes will be drilled into your skull. \n The surgeon will pass electrodes through each hole and position them in a part of the basal ganglia called the globus pallidus. The basal ganglia is part of the brain that affects muscle movement. \n The electrodes will be connected to a small pulse generator that's similar to a  pacemaker . It will be implanted under your skin, usually on your chest or lower abdomen. \n The pulse generator sends signals to the globus pallidus. This alters nerve impulses produced by the basal ganglia and improves the symptoms of dystonia. \n The most common complication of DBS is that either the pulse generator stops working or the electrodes become displaced, which may require further surgery to correct. \n DBS is a relatively new technique, so there's little information regarding its long-term safety or effectiveness. Therefore, before deciding to have DBS, you should discuss the risks and benefits of the treatment with your surgical team. \n If you have DBS, you're likely to need a series of follow-up appointments. This is because in most cases the signals produced by the pulse generator need to be adjusted to ensure your symptoms are being properly controlled. \n It may be several weeks or months before you begin to feel the benefit of DBS. The benefit should continue to increase for a few years following surgery. \n Selective peripheral denervation \n Selective peripheral denervation is a type of surgery used to treat cervical dystonia. However, these days it only tends to be used in a few, select cases. \n During the procedure, the surgeon will make an incision in your neck, before cutting some of the nerves connected to muscles prone to spasms. \n The surgery will be carried out under  general anaesthetic , which means you'll be unconscious throughout the procedure and unable to feel pain or discomfort. \n After\u00a0the procedure, you'll lose some feeling in your neck because the nerves have been disconnected. \n Selective peripheral denervation is generally a safe type of surgery and complications are rare. However, possible complications include: \n \n infection in the neck \n short-term swelling of the neck \n a feeling of\u00a0pins and needles in the neck \n occasional short episodes of neck pain", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Diagnosing dystonia isn't straightforward. It involves using a stepwise approach that starts by identifying the precise nature and specific features of your movement disorders. \n The specialist will try to identify which type of dystonia classification your movement disorders fall into, taking into consideration a number of factors, including: \n \n how old you were when your symptoms started \n the order in which your symptoms developed \n the speed at which the condition is progressing \n the results of initial tests and investigations \n \n It's important to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia to help determine the type of treatment you need. \n In primary dystonia, muscle spasms are the only symptom and there's no other associated condition. Secondary dystonia is caused by an underlying health condition, injury or some other type of damage. \n Further tests \n If you have the\u00a0typical signs of\u00a0late-onset focal dystonia, you may not need to have specific investigations. However, you may need to have a series of tests and examinations to confirm whether you have primary or secondary dystonia. These tests are described below: \n \n Your recent medical and family history will be discussed \u2013 for example, whether you've recently had a  head injury , or whether you have a relative with dystonia. \n Urine and  blood tests  \u2013 to check how well your organs, such as your liver, are functioning and whether you have an infection or high levels of toxins in your body. \n Genetic testing \u2013 a DNA sample can be taken from your blood and checked for\u00a0the abnormal genes associated with some types of dystonia; genetic testing can also confirm whether your dystonia is caused by a genetic condition, such as\u00a0 Huntington's disease . \n A  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013 can check whether there's any damage to your brain, or whether you have a condition that's affecting your brain, such as a  tumour . \n \n If you have early-onset dystonia, you may also be given a course of medication called levodopa. If your symptoms improve significantly after taking levodopa, a diagnosis of dopa-responsive dystonia can be made."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Dysphagia (swallowing problems)", "introduction": "Dysphagia is the medical term for swallowing difficulties. \n Some people with dysphagia have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids, while others can't swallow at all. \n Other signs of dysphagia include: \n \n  coughing \u00a0or choking when eating or drinking \n bringing food back up, sometimes through the nose \n a sensation that food is stuck in your throat or chest \n persistent drooling of saliva\u00a0 \n \n Over time, dysphagia can also cause symptoms such as weight loss and repeated chest infections. \n You should see your GP if you have swallowing difficulties. \n What causes dysphagia? \n Dysphagia is usually caused by another health condition, such as: \n \n a condition that affects the nervous system, such as a  stroke ,  head injury ,\u00a0or\u00a0 dementia  \n  cancer \u00a0\u2013 such as  mouth cancer \u00a0or  oesophageal cancer \u00a0 \n  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease\u00a0(GORD) \u00a0\u2013 where stomach acid leaks back up into the\u00a0oesophagus \n \n Dysphagia can also occur in children\u00a0as\u00a0the result of a developmental or learning disability. \n Dysphagia can be caused by problems with the: \n \n mouth or throat, known as oropharyngeal or \"high\" dysphagia \n oesophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach), known as oesophageal or \"low\" dysphagia \n \n Read more about the  causes of dysphagia . \n Treating dysphagia \n Treatment usually depends on the cause and type of dysphagia. The type of dysphagia you have can usually be diagnosed after testing your swallowing ability and examining your oesophagus. \n Many cases of dysphagia can be improved with treatment, but a cure isn't always possible. Treatments for dysphagia include: \n \n speech and language therapy to learn new swallowing techniques\u00a0 \n changing the consistency of food and liquids to make them safer to swallow \n alternative forms of feeding, such as tube feeding through the nose or stomach \n surgery to widen the narrowing of the oesophagus by stretching it or inserting a plastic or metal tube (known as a stent) \n \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing dysphagia  and  treating dysphagia . \n Complications of dysphagia \n Dysphagia can sometimes lead to further problems. One of the most common problems is coughing or choking when food\u00a0goes down the \"wrong way\" and blocks your airway. \n If this occurs frequently, you may avoid eating and drinking\u00a0because you fear\u00a0choking, which\u00a0can lead to  malnutrition  and  dehydration . \n Some people with dysphagia have a tendency to develop chest infections, such as aspiration  pneumonia , which require medical treatment. \n Dysphagia can also affect your quality of life\u00a0as it may prevent\u00a0you enjoying meals and social occasions. \n Read more about the\u00a0 complications of dysphagia .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "As swallowing is a complex process, there are many reasons why dysphagia can develop. \n Some causes of dysphagia are explained below. \n Neurological causes \n The nervous system is made up of the brain, nerves and spinal cord. Damage to the nervous system can interfere with the nerves responsible for starting and controlling swallowing. This can lead to dysphagia. \n Some neurological causes of dysphagia include: \n \n a  stroke \u00a0 \n neurological conditions that cause damage to the brain and nervous system over time,\u00a0including  Parkinson's disease ,\u00a0 multiple sclerosis ,  dementia ,\u00a0and  motor neurone disease  \n  brain tumours  \n myasthenia gravis\u00a0\u2013 a rare condition that causes your muscles to become weak \n \n Congenital and developmental conditions \n The term \"congenital\" refers to something you're born with. Developmental conditions affect the way you develop. \n Congenital or developmental conditions that may cause dysphagia include:\u00a0 \n \n learning disabilities\u00a0\u2013 where learning, understanding, and communicating are difficult \n cerebral palsy\u00a0\u2013 a group of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination \n a cleft lip\u00a0and\u00a0palate\u00a0\u2013 a common birth defect that results in a gap or split in the upper lip or roof of the mouth \n \n Obstruction \n Conditions that cause an obstruction in the throat or a narrowing of the oesophagus\u00a0(the tube that carries food from your mouth to the stomach)\u00a0can make swallowing difficult. \n Some causes of obstruction and narrowing include: \n \n  mouth cancer  or throat cancer, such as  laryngeal cancer  or  oesophageal cancer  \u2013 once these cancers are treated, the obstruction may no longer be an issue \n pharyngeal (throat) pouches, also known as Zenker diverticulum \u2013 where a large sac develops in the upper part of the oesophagus, which reduces the ability to swallow both liquids and solids;\u00a0it's a rare condition that mainly affects older people \n eosinophilic oesophagitis \u2013\u00a0where a type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil\u00a0builds up in the lining of the oesophagus as the result of a reaction to foods, allergens, or acid reflux; the build-up damages the lining of the oesophagus and causes swallowing difficulties \n  radiotherapy  treatment \u2013 this\u00a0can cause scar tissue, which narrows the passageway in your throat and oesophagus \n  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease\u00a0(GORD) \u00a0\u2013 stomach acid can cause scar tissue to develop, narrowing your oesophagus\u00a0 \n infections, such as  tuberculosis  or  thrush \u00a0\u2013 these\u00a0can lead to inflammation of the oesophagus (oesophagitis) \n \n Muscular conditions \n Any condition that affects the muscles used to push food down the oesophagus and into the stomach can cause dysphagia,\u00a0although\u00a0such conditions are rare. \n 2\u00a0muscular conditions associated with dysphagia are: \n \n scleroderma\u00a0\u2013 where the immune system (the body's natural defence system) attacks healthy tissue, leading to a stiffening of the throat and oesophagus muscles \n achalasia \u2013 where muscles in the oesophagus lose their ability to relax and open to allow food or liquid to enter the stomach \n \n Other causes \n As you get older, the\u00a0muscles\u00a0used for swallowing can become weaker. This may explain why dysphagia is relatively common\u00a0in elderly people. Treatment is available to help people with age-related dysphagia. \n  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\u00a0(COPD)  is a collection of lung conditions that make it difficult to breathe in and out properly. Breathing difficulties can sometimes affect your ability to swallow. \n Dysphagia can also sometimes develop as a complication of head or neck\u00a0surgery.", "treatment": "Most swallowing problems can be treated, although the treatment you receive will depend on the type of dysphagia you have. \n Treatment will depend on whether your swallowing problem\u00a0is in the mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or \"high\" dysphagia), or in the oesophagus (oesophageal, or \"low\" dysphagia). \n The cause of dysphagia is also considered when deciding on treatment. In some cases, treating the underlying cause, such as  mouth cancer  or  oesophageal cancer ,\u00a0can help relieve swallowing problems. \n Treatment for dysphagia may be managed by a\u00a0group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Your MDT may include\u00a0a speech and language therapist (SLT), a surgeon, and a dietitian. \n High (oropharyngeal) dysphagia \n High dysphagia is swallowing difficulties caused by problems with the mouth or throat. \n It can be difficult to treat if it's caused by a condition that\u00a0affects the nervous system.\u00a0This is because these problems can't usually be corrected using medication or surgery. \n There are 3\u00a0main treatments\u00a0for high dysphagia: \n \n swallowing therapy \n dietary changes\u00a0 \n feeding tubes \n \n Swallowing therapy \n You may be referred to a speech and language therapist (SLT) for swallowing therapy if you have high dysphagia. \n An SLT is a healthcare professional trained to work with people with feeding or swallowing difficulties. \n SLTs use a range of techniques that can be tailored\u00a0for your specific problem, such as\u00a0teaching you swallowing exercises. \n Dietary changes \n You may be referred to a dietitian (specialist in nutrition)\u00a0for advice about changes to your diet to make sure\u00a0you receive a  healthy, balanced diet . \n An SLT\u00a0can give you advice about\u00a0softer foods and thickened fluids that you may find easier to swallow. They may also try to ensure you're getting the support you need at meal times. \n Feeding tubes \n Feeding tubes can be used to provide nutrition while you're recovering your ability to swallow. They may also be required in severe cases of dysphagia that put you at risk of\u00a0 malnutrition  and\u00a0 dehydration . \n A feeding tube\u00a0can also make it easier for you to take the medication you may need for other conditions. \n There are 2\u00a0types of feeding tubes: \n \n a nasogastric tube \u2013 a tube that is passed down your nose and into your stomach \n a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube \u2013\u00a0a tube that is implanted directly into your stomach \n \n Nasogastric tubes are designed for short-term use. The tube will need to be replaced and swapped to the other nostril after about a month. PEG tubes are designed for long-term use and last several months before they need to be replaced. \n Most people with dysphagia prefer to use a PEG tube because it can be hidden under clothing. However, they carry a greater risk of complications compared\u00a0with nasogastric tubes. \n Minor complications of PEG tubes include tube displacement, skin infection, and a blocked or leaking tube. 2\u00a0major complications of PEG tubes are infection and internal bleeding. \n Resuming normal feeding may be more difficult with a PEG tube compared with using a nasogastric tube. The convenience of PEG tubes can make people less willing to carry out swallowing exercises and dietary changes than those who\u00a0use nasogastric tubes. \n You should discuss the pros and cons of both types of feeding tubes with your treatment team. \n Low (oesophageal) dysphagia \n Low dysphagia is swallowing difficulties\u00a0caused by\u00a0problems with the oesophagus. \n Medication \n Depending on the cause of low dysphagia, it may be possible to treat it with medication. For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) used to treat  indigestion  may improve symptoms caused by narrowing or scarring of the oesophagus.\u00a0 \n Botulinum toxin \n Botulinum toxin\u00a0can sometimes be used to treat achalasia. This is a condition where the muscles in the oesophagus become too stiff to allow food and liquid to enter the stomach. \n It can be used to paralyse the tightened muscles that prevent food from reaching the stomach. However, the effects only last for around 6\u00a0months. \n Surgery \n Other cases of low dysphagia can usually be treated with surgery. \n Endoscopic dilatation \n Endoscopic dilation is widely used to treat dysphagia caused by obstruction. It\u00a0can also be used to stretch your\u00a0oesophagus if it's scarred. \n Endoscopic dilatation will be carried out during an\u00a0internal examination of your oesophagus (gastroscopy)\u00a0using an endoscopy. \n An endoscope is passed down your throat and into your\u00a0oesophagus, and\u00a0images of the inside of your body are transmitted to a television screen. \n Using the image as guidance, a small balloon or a bougie (a thin, flexible medical instrument) is passed through the narrowed part of your oesophagus to widen it. If a balloon is used, it will be gradually inflated to widen your oesophagus before being deflated and removed. \n You may be given a mild sedative before the procedure to relax you. There's a small risk that the procedure\u00a0could cause a tear or perforate your\u00a0oesophagus. \n Find out more about gastroscopy. \n Inserting a stent \n If you have\u00a0 oesophageal cancer \u00a0that can't be removed, it's usually recommended that you have a\u00a0stent inserted instead of endoscopic dilatation. This is because, if you have cancer,\u00a0there's a higher risk of perforating your oesophagus if it's stretched. \n A stent (usually a metal mesh tube)\u00a0is inserted\u00a0into your\u00a0oesophagus during an endoscopy or under  X-ray  guidance. \n The stent then gradually expands to create a passage wide enough to allow food to pass through. You'll need to follow a particular diet to keep the stent open without having\u00a0blockages. \n Congenital dysphagia \n If your baby is born with difficulty swallowing (congenital dysphagia), their treatment will depend on the cause. \n Cerebral palsy \n Dysphagia caused by cerebral palsy\u00a0can be treated with speech and language therapy. Your child will be taught how to swallow, how to adjust the type of food they eat, and how to use feeding tubes.\u00a0 \n Cleft lip and palate \n Cleft lip and palate\u00a0is a facial birth defect that can cause dysphagia. It's usually treated with surgery.\u00a0 \n Narrowing of the oesophagus \n Narrowing of the oesophagus may be treated with a type of surgery called dilatation to widen the oesophagus.\u00a0 \n Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \n Dysphagia caused by\u00a0 gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \u00a0can be treated using special thickened feeds instead of your usual breast or formula milk. Sometimes medication may also be used. \n Breastfeeding or bottle feeding \n If you're having difficulty bottle feeding or breastfeeding your baby: \n \n see your midwife, health visitor or GP \n see  common breastfeeding\u00a0problems", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP if you're having any difficulty swallowing. They'll carry out an initial assessment and may refer you for further tests and treatment. \n Tests will help determine whether your dysphagia is\u00a0the result of\u00a0a problem with your mouth or throat (oropharyngeal, or \"high\" dysphagia), or your oesophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach (oesophageal, or \"low\" dysphagia). \n Diagnosing the specific type of dysphagia can make treatment more effective and reduce your chances of developing  complications of dysphagia , such as choking or  pneumonia . \n Your GP will want to know: \n \n how long you've had dysphagia \n whether your symptoms come and go, or are getting worse \n whether dysphagia has affected your ability to swallow solids, liquids, or both \n whether you've lost weight \n \n Specialist referral \n Depending on the suspected cause,\u00a0you may be referred for further tests with:\u00a0 \n \n an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist\u00a0 \n a speech and language therapist (SLT) \n a neurologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in conditions that affect the brain, nerves, and spinal cord \n a gastroenterologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in treating conditions of the gullet, stomach, and intestines \n a geriatrician\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in the care of elderly people \n \n The types of tests you might need are explained below. \n Water swallow test \n A water swallow test\u00a0is usually carried out by a speech and language therapist, and\u00a0can\u00a0give a good initial assessment of your swallowing abilities. You'll be given 150ml of water and asked to swallow it as quickly as possible. \n The time\u00a0it takes you to drink all of the water and the number of swallows required will be recorded. You may also be asked to swallow a soft piece of pudding or fruit. \n Videofluoroscopy \n A videofluoroscopy, or modified barium swallow, is one of the most effective ways of assessing your swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problem is. \n An\u00a0 X-ray \u00a0machine records a continuous moving X-ray on to video, allowing your swallowing problems to be studied in detail. \n You'll be asked to swallow different types of food and drink of different consistencies, mixed with a non-toxic liquid called barium that shows up on X-rays. \n A videofluoroscopy usually takes about 30 minutes. You may feel sick after the test, and the barium may cause  constipation . Your stools may also be white for a few days as the barium passes through your system. \n Nasoendoscopy \n A nasendoscopy, sometimes also known as fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES),\u00a0is a procedure that allows the nose and upper airways to be closely examined using\u00a0a very small flexible tube known as an endoscope. \n The endoscope is inserted into your nose so the specialist can look down on to your throat and upper airways. It has a light and camera at the end so images of the throat can be viewed on a television screen. This allows any blockages or problem areas to be identified. \n FEES can also be used to test for oropharyngeal dysphagia after you're asked to swallow a small amount of test liquid (usually coloured water or milk). \n Before the procedure, you may have\u00a0 local anaesthetic  spray into your nose, but because the camera doesn't go as far as your throat, it doesn't cause retching. The procedure is safe and usually only takes a few minutes. \n Read more about endoscopy. \n Manometry and 24-hour pH study \n Manometry is a procedure to assess the function of your oesophagus. It involves passing a small\u00a0tube (catheter) with pressure sensors through your nose and into your oesophagus to monitor its function. \n The test measures the pressures\u00a0within your\u00a0oesophagus when you swallow, which determines how well it's working. \n The 24-hour pH study involves inserting a tube into your oesophagus through your nose to measure the amount of acid that flows back from your stomach.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Down's syndrome", "introduction": "Down's syndrome, also known as Down syndrome, is a genetic condition that typically causes some level of learning disability and characteristic physical features. \n Around 775 babies are born with the condition each year in England and Wales. \n Many babies born with Down's syndrome are diagnosed with the condition after birth and are likely to have: \n \n reduced muscle tone leading to\u00a0floppiness (hypotonia) \n eyes that slant upwards and outwards \n a small mouth with a protruding tongue \n a flat back of the head \n below-average weight and length at birth \n \n Although children with Down's syndrome share some common physical characteristics, they do not all look the same. A child with Down's syndrome will look more like their mother, father or other family members than\u00a0other children with the syndrome. \n People with Down's syndrome also vary in personality and ability. Everyone born with Down's syndrome will have a degree of learning disability, but the level of disability will be different for each individual. \n Read more about the  characteristics of Down's syndrome  \n Screening for Down's syndrome \n In some cases, babies with the condition are identified before birth as a result of  screening for Down's syndrome . \n Screening tests can't tell you for definite if your baby has Down's syndrome, but they can tell you how likely it is. If screening suggests there is a chance your baby does have Down's syndrome, further tests can be carried out during pregnancy to confirm it. \n If testing indicates your child will be born with Down's syndrome, you should be offered genetic counselling to allow you and your partner to discuss the impact of the diagnosis. \n You may also be offered an appointment to meet a doctor or other health professional who works with children with Down's syndrome, who can also tell you more about the condition and answer any questions you may have. \n Read more about  diagnosing Down's syndrome  \n What causes Down's syndrome? \n Down's\u00a0syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in a baby's cells. \n In the vast majority of cases, this isn't inherited and is simply the result of a one-off genetic mistake in the sperm or egg. \n There is a small chance of having a child with Down's syndrome with every pregnancy, but the likelihood increases with the age of the mother. For example, a woman who is 20 has about a\u00a01 in 1,500 chance of having a baby with the condition, while a woman who is 40 has a\u00a01 in 100 chance. \n There is no evidence that anything done before or during pregnancy increases or decreases the chance of having a child\u00a0with Down's syndrome. \n Read more about the  causes of Down's syndrome  \n Life with Down's syndrome \n Although there is no \"cure\" for Down's syndrome, there are ways to help children with the condition develop into healthy and fulfilled individuals who are able to achieve the level of independence right for them. This includes: \n \n access to good healthcare, including a range of different specialists \n early intervention programmes to provide support for children and parents \n good parenting skills and an ordinary family life \n education and support groups to provide information and help for parents, friends and families \n \n Improved education and support has led to more opportunities\u00a0for people with Down's syndrome. These include being able to leave home, form new relationships, gain employment and lead largely independent lives. \n However, it is important to remember each child is different and it is not possible to predict how individuals will develop. \n Read more about  living with Down's syndrome  \n Care and support \n If you have Down's syndrome or care for someone who has Down's syndrome, it may be useful to visit  Care Information Scotland .\u00a0This site\u00a0is for people with care and support needs, as well as\u00a0their carers and relatives. \n Associated health conditions \n There are a number of\u00a0disorders that are more common in people with Down's syndrome. These include: \n \n hearing and vision\u00a0problems \n heart disorders, such as\u00a0 congenital heart disease  \n thyroid problems, such as an\u00a0 underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)  \n recurrent infections, such as\u00a0 pneumonia  \n \n Your child may be checked by a paediatrician more often than other children to pick up developing problems as early as possible.\u00a0If you have any concerns about your child's health, discuss them with your GP, health visitor or paediatrician. \n Read more about the  complications of Down's syndrome", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs as a result of an extra chromosome (chromosome 21). \n Chromosomes \n The human body is made up of cells that contain genes. Genes are grouped in thread-like structures called chromosomes. \n Chromosomes are blocks of DNA and contain detailed genetic instructions responsible for a wide range of factors, including: \n \n how the body's cells develop \n the colour of the eyes \n the sex of a baby \n \n Usually, cells contain 46 chromosomes. A child inherits 23 from the mother and 23 from the father. \n In people with Down's syndrome, all or some of the cells in their bodies contain 47 chromosomes, as there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. The additional genetic material causes physical and developmental characteristics associated with Down's syndrome. \n Types of Down's syndrome \n There are three forms of Down's syndrome, although the effects of each type are usually very similar. \n \n Trisomy 21 is the most common type, affecting around 94% of people with Down's syndrome. It's\u00a0where every cell in the body has an extra copy of chromosome 21. \n Translocation is where an extra\u00a0piece of chromosome 21 attaches itself to another chromosome. It affects around 4% of people with Down's syndrome.\u00a0In this situation, there are only 46 chromosomes in each cell but one of them has extra material attached, so the total amount of genetic material in the cell is similar to that seen in a trisomy. \n Mosaicism is the least common type, affecting around 2% of people with Down's syndrome. Only some of the cells have an extra copy of chromosome 21, which can mean people with mosaic Down's syndrome experience less delay with some aspects of their development. \n \n In the vast majority of cases,\u00a0Down's syndrome isn't inherited, and is simply the result of a one-off genetic mistake in the sperm or egg. \n However, in some cases\u00a0caused by the\u00a0translocation of chromosome 21, the genetic mistake is passed on from one of the child's parents, even if they have no signs of Down's syndrome themselves. \n What are the chances of having an affected pregnancy? \n With every pregnancy, there is a small chance of having a child with Down's syndrome. \n There's currently no clear\u00a0evidence to suggest that anything done before or during pregnancy increases or decreases this chance, although some people are more likely to have a child with Down's syndrome than others. \n The main factor that increases the chance\u00a0of having a baby with Down's syndrome is the age of the woman when she becomes pregnant. For example, a woman who is: \n \n 20 years of age has a chance of one in 1,500 \n 30 years of age has a\u00a0chance of one in 800 \n 35 years of age has a\u00a0chance of one in 270 \n 40 years of age has a\u00a0chance of one in 100 \n 45 years of age has a\u00a0chance of one in 50 or greater \n \n However,\u00a0babies with Down's syndrome are born to mothers of all ages. \n The chance\u00a0of having a child with Down's syndrome is\u00a0also increased if you have previously had an affected pregnancy. For most people this chance is still small (around one in 100), although this may be as high as one in 10\u00a0if you or your partner have the altered genes that can lead to the translocation of chromosome 21. \n There is around a one in two chance of a child having Down's syndrome if one of his or her parents has the condition.", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Screening during pregnancy can determine the likelihood of a baby being born with Down's syndrome, but in many cases the condition is only diagnosed after birth. \n Screening during pregnancy \n All pregnant women\u00a0are offered screening for Down's syndrome. \n Screening cannot\u00a0definitively diagnose Down's syndrome, but it can help determine the chances of your baby having Down's syndrome. \n The screening tests are: \n \n a blood test plus nuchal translucency ultrasound scan (nuchal translucency\u00a0is a collection of fluid at the back of the baby's neck) \u2013 this is called the combined test, and is offered between 11 and 14 weeks of pregnancy \n \n or \n \n a blood test that can be offered between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy if you are too far along to have the combined test \u2013 this blood test is less accurate than the combined test \n \n Read more about  screening for Down\u2019s syndrome  in pregnancy, including when it\u2019s carried out and the different tests used. \n If the screening test results\u00a0show that you have a higher chance of having a baby with Down's, you will be offered diagnostic tests to find out for certain if your baby has the condition. \n Diagnosis during pregnancy \n There are two main tests used to diagnose a baby with Down's syndrome while it's still in the womb. These are: \n \n  chorionic villus sampling (CVS)  \u2013 a small sample of the placenta (an organ attached to the lining of your womb during pregnancy) is removed with a needle or tube for examination; this is usually done from week 11 of pregnancy \n  amniocentesis  \u2013 a small sample of amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the foetus in the womb) is removed with a needle for examination; this is usually carried out from week 15 of pregnancy \n \n Make sure you discuss the benefits and risks of having either of these procedures with your doctor or midwife beforehand though, as both tests are thought to have around a one in 100 chance of causing a  miscarriage . \n Getting the results \n The results of CVS or amniocentesis\u00a0are normally available within a few days. \n If the test shows that your baby is unlikely to have Down's syndrome, your pregnancy should continue\u00a0as normal. \n If you are told that it's likely your baby does have\u00a0Down's syndrome,\u00a0you should be offered\u00a0genetic counselling to allow you and your partner to discuss the impact of the diagnosis on you, and talk about the available options. \n You may also be offered an appointment to meet a doctor or other health professional who works with children with Down\u2019s syndrome, who can also tell you more about the condition and answer any questions you may have. \n This will help you make an informed choice about how to proceed with the pregnancy. \n Diagnosis after birth \n Once your baby is born,\u00a0an initial diagnosis of Down's syndrome is usually based on your baby's appearance, as there are often clear physical  characteristics of Down's syndrome . \n If your doctor needs to confirm the diagnosis, a sample of your child's blood can be taken and analysed to look for the extra copy of chromosome 21 that causes Down's syndrome."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Diverticular disease and diverticulitis", "introduction": "Diverticular disease and diverticulitis are related digestive conditions that affect the large intestine (colon). \n In\u00a0diverticular disease,\u00a0small bulges or pockets (diverticula) develop in the lining of the intestine. Diverticulitis is when these pockets\u00a0become inflamed or infected. \n Symptoms of diverticular disease include: \n \n lower abdominal pain \n feeling bloated \n \n The majority of people with diverticula will not have any symptoms; this is known as diverticulosis. \n Symptoms of diverticulitis tend to be more serious and include: \n \n more severe abdominal pain, especially on the left side \n high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n diarrhoea or frequent bowel movements \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis . \n Diverticulosis, diverticular disease\u00a0and diverticulitis \n Diverticula \n \"Diverticula\" is the medical term used to describe the small bulges that stick out of the side of the large intestine (colon). \n Diverticula are common and associated with ageing. The large intestine becomes weaker with age, and the pressure of hard stools passing through the large intestine\u00a0is thought to\u00a0cause the bulges to form. \n Read more about the  causes of diverticula . \n It's estimated that\u00a05% of people have diverticula by the time they are 40 years old, and at least 50% of people have them by the time they are 80 years old. \n Diverticular disease \n 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0people who develop diverticula will experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain. \n Having symptoms associated with diverticula is known as diverticular disease. \n Diverticulitis \n Diverticulitis describes infection that occurs when bacteria becomes trapped inside one of the bulges, triggering more severe symptoms. \n Diverticulitis can lead to complications, such as an abscess next to\u00a0the intestine. \n Read more about the\u00a0 complications of diverticulitis . \n Treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis \n A high-fibre diet can often ease\u00a0symptoms of diverticular disease, and\u00a0 paracetamol  can be used to relieve pain\u00a0\u2013 other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. Speak to your GP if paracetamol alone is not working. \n Mild diverticulitis can usually be treated at home with  antibiotics \u00a0prescribed by your GP. More serious cases may need hospital treatment to prevent and treat complications. \n Surgery to remove the\u00a0affected section of the intestine is sometimes recommended if there have been serious complications, although this is rare. \n Read more about  treating diverticular disease and diverticulitis . \n Who is affected \n Diverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions. \n There were 113,983\u00a0hospital admissions due to diverticulitis in England in 2012-13. \n Both sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. Overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old. \n Diverticular disease is often described as a \"Western disease\" because the rates are high in European and North American countries, and low in African and Asian countries. \n A combination of genetics and diet is thought to be the reason for this and the fact that people in Western countries tend to\u00a0eat less fibre. \n People aged 50-70 who eat a high-fibre diet (25g a day) have a 40% lower chance of admission to hospital with complications of diverticular disease \u2013 compared to others in their age range with the lowest amount of dietary fibre.", "symptoms": "Symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis include abdominal pain, bloating and a change in normal bowel habits. \n Diverticulosis \n If diverticula have been discovered during a camera test for another reason (colonoscopy) or during a CT scan, you may be worried about what this means. \n However, if you have never had abdominal pain or bouts of diarrhoea, there is a 70-80% chance that you will never have any symptoms from them. \n Diverticula\u00a0are\u00a0extremely common over the age of 70 and they do not increase your risk of cancer.\u00a0It's thought that a high-fibre diet is likely to reduce the risk of any symptoms developing. \n Diverticular disease \n The most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side. \n The pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. Passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help\u00a0relieve the pain. \n Other long-term symptoms of diverticular disease include: \n \n a change in your normal bowel habits, such as\u00a0 constipation  or  diarrhoea , or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea \u2013 a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like \"rabbit pellets\" \n bloating \n \n Another possible symptom of diverticular disease is\u00a0bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). This usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is\u00a0an uncommon complication. \n Diverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your GP. \n Diverticulitis \n Diverticulitis shares\u00a0most of the symptoms of diverticular disease (see above). However, the\u00a0pain associated with diverticulitis is constant and severe, rather than intermittent. It is most likely to occur if you have previously had symptoms of diverticular disease, and develops over a day or 2. \n Other symptoms of diverticulitis can include: \n \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n a general feeling of being tired and unwell \n feeling sick (nausea) or  being sick  (vomiting) \n \n The pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen. \n In Asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. This is because East Asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon for genetic reasons. \n When to seek medical advice \n Contact your GP as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of diverticulitis. \n If you have symptoms of diverticular disease and the condition has previously been diagnosed, you do not usually need to contact your GP as\u00a0the symptoms can be treated at home.\u00a0 \n Read more about the\u00a0 treatment of\u00a0diverticular disease . \n If you have not been diagnosed with the condition, contact your GP so they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as: \n \n a  stomach ulcer  \n  pancreatitis  \n  cholecystitis  \n  bowel cancer  \n \n Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can also cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease.", "causes": "Diverticular disease is caused by small bulges in the large intestine (diverticula) developing and becoming inflamed. If any of the diverticula become infected, this leads to symptoms of diverticulitis. \n The exact reason why diverticula develop is not known, but\u00a0they\u00a0are associated with not eating enough fibre. \n Fibre makes your stools softer and larger, so less pressure is needed by your large intestine to push them out of your body. \n The pressure of moving hard, small pieces of stools through your\u00a0large intestine creates weak spots in the outside layer of muscle. This allows the inner layer (mucosa)\u00a0to squeeze through these weak spots, creating the diverticula. \n There is currently no clinical evidence to fully prove the link between fibre and diverticula. However, diverticular disease and diverticulitis are both much more common in Western countries, where many people do not eat enough fibre. \n Diverticular disease \n It is not known why only 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0people with diverticula go on to have symptoms of diverticulitis. Diverticular disease may be chronic low-level diverticulitis. The symptoms are very similar to\u00a0 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u00a0and may overlap. \n However,\u00a0factors that appear to increase your risk of developing diverticular disease include: \n \n  smoking  \n being overweight or  obese   \n having a history of  constipation   \n use of  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u00a0painkillers, such as\u00a0 ibuprofen  or naproxen \n having a close relative with diverticular disease, especially if they developed it under the age of 50 \n \n Exactly how these lead to developing diverticular disease is unclear. \n Diverticulitis \n Diverticulitis is caused by an infection of one or more of the diverticula. \n It is thought an infection develops when a hard piece of stool or undigested food\u00a0gets trapped in one of the pouches. This gives bacteria in the stool the chance to multiply and spread, triggering an infection.", "treatment": "Treatment options for diverticular disease and diverticulitis depend on how severe your symptoms are. \n Diverticular disease \n Most cases of diverticular disease can be treated at home. \n The over-the-counter painkiller  paracetamol  is recommended to help relieve your symptoms. \n Painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are not recommended because they may upset your stomach and increase your risk of internal bleeding. \n Eating a high-fibre diet may initially help to control your symptoms. Some people will notice an improvement after a few days, although it can take around a month\u00a0to feel the benefits fully. Read more advice about  using diet to improve the symptoms of\u00a0diverticular disease . \n If you\u00a0have  constipation , you may be given a bulk-forming laxative. These can cause flatulence (wind) and bloating. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent any obstruction in your digestive system. \n Heavy or constant rectal bleeding occurs in about 1 in\u00a020 cases of diverticular disease. This can happen if the blood vessels in your large intestine (colon) are weakened by the diverticula, making them vulnerable to damage. The bleeding is usually painless, but losing too much blood can be potentially serious and may need a  blood transfusion . \n Signs that you may be experiencing heavy bleeding (aside from the amount of blood) include: \n \n feeling very dizzy \n mental confusion \n pale clammy skin \n shortness of breath \n \n If you suspect that you (or someone in your care) is experiencing heavy bleeding, seek immediate medical advice. Contact your GP at once. If this is not possible then call  NHS 24 111 service  or your  local out-of-hours service . \n Diverticulitis \n Treatment at home \n Mild diverticulitis can often be treated at home. Your GP will prescribe\u00a0 antibiotics  for the infection and you should take paracetamol for the pain.\u00a0It's important that you finish the complete course of antibiotics, even if you are feeling better. \n Some types of antibiotics used to treat diverticulitis can cause side effects in some people, including vomiting and  diarrhoea .\u00a0 \n Your GP may recommend that you stick to a fluid-only diet for a few days until your symptoms improve. This is because trying to digest solid foods may make your symptoms worse. You\u00a0can gradually introduce solid foods over the next 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0days. \n For the 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0days of recovery, a low-fibre diet is suggested, until you return to the preventative high-fibre diet. This is to reduce the amount of faeces (poo) your large bowel has to\u00a0deal with\u00a0while it is inflamed. \n If you have not been diagnosed with diverticular disease before, your GP may refer you for a test such as a\u00a0colonoscopy or\u00a0CT colonography\u00a0after the symptoms have settled. \n Treatment at hospital \n If you have more severe diverticulitis, you may need to go to hospital, particularly if: \n \n your pain cannot be controlled using paracetamol \n you are unable to drink enough fluids to keep yourself hydrated \n you are unable to take antibiotics by mouth\u00a0 \n your general state of health is poor \n you have a weakened immune system \n your GP suspects complications \n your symptoms fail to improve after two days of treatment at home \n \n If you are admitted to hospital for treatment, you are likely\u00a0to receive injections of antibiotics and be kept hydrated and nourished using an intravenous drip (a tube directly connected to your vein). Most people start to improve within 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days. \n Surgery \n In the past, surgery was recommended as a preventative measure for people who had 2\u00a0episodes of diverticulitis as a precaution to prevent complications. \n This is no longer the case, as studies have found that in most cases, risks of serious complications from surgery (estimated to be around 1 in 100) usually outweigh the benefits. \n However, there are exceptions to this, such as: \n \n if you have a history of serious complications arising from diverticulitis \n if you have\u00a0symptoms of diverticular disease from\u00a0a young age (it is thought the longer you live with diverticular disease, the greater your chances of having a serious complication) \n if you have a weakened immune system or are more vulnerable to\u00a0infections \n \n If surgery is being considered, discuss both\u00a0benefits and risks carefully with the doctor in charge of your care. \n In rare cases, a severe episode of diverticulitis can only be treated with emergency surgery. This is when a hole (perforation) has developed in the bowel. This is uncommon, but causes very severe abdominal pain, which needs an emergency trip to hospital. \n Colectomy \n Surgery for diverticulitis involves removing the affected section of your\u00a0large intestine. This is known as a colectomy. There are 2\u00a0ways this operation can be performed: \n \n an open colectomy \u2013\u00a0where the surgeon makes a large incision (cut) in your abdomen (stomach) and removes a section of your\u00a0large intestine \n laparoscopic colectomy \u2013 a type of \"keyhole surgery\" where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments\u00a0guided by a camera to remove a section of\u00a0large intestine \n \n Open colectomies and laparoscopic colectomies are thought equally effective in treating diverticulitis, and have a similar risk of complications. People who have laparoscopic colectomies tend to recover faster and have less pain after the operation. \n Emergency surgery when the bowel has perforated is more likely to be open and may result in a\u00a0 stoma  being formed (see below). \n Stoma surgery ('having a bag') \n In some cases, the surgeon may decide your\u00a0large intestine needs to heal before it can be reattached, or that too much of your\u00a0large intestine has been removed to make reattachment possible. \n In such cases, stoma surgery provides a way of removing waste materials from your body without using all of your\u00a0large intestine. It is known as \"having a bag\" as a bag is stuck to the skin on your belly and the faeces (poo) are collected in the bag. \n Stoma surgery involves the surgeon making a small hole in your abdomen \u2013 known as a stoma. There are 2\u00a0ways this procedure can be carried out:\u00a0 \n \n An  ileostomy  \u2013\u00a0where a stoma is made in the right-hand side of your abdomen. Your small intestine is separated from your\u00a0large intestine and connected to the stoma, and the rest of the\u00a0large intestine is sealed. You will need to wear a pouch connected to the stoma to collect waste material (poo). \n A  colostomy  \u2013\u00a0where a stoma is made in your lower abdomen and a section of your\u00a0large intestine is removed and connected to the stoma. As with an ileostomy, you will need to wear a pouch to collect waste material. \n \n In most cases, the stoma will be temporary and can be removed once your\u00a0large intestine has recovered from the surgery. This will depend on the situation when you had the operation. If it was an emergency operation, you may need a few months to recover before having surgery to reverse the stoma. \n If a large section of your\u00a0large intestine is affected by diverticulitis and needs to be removed, or if you have multiple other conditions that make major surgery a risk, you may need a permanent ileostomy or colostomy. \n Results of surgery \n In general terms, elective (non-emergency) surgery is usually successful, although it does not achieve a complete cure in all cases. Following surgery, an estimated 1 in 12 people will have a recurrence of symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis.\u00a0 \n In an emergency setting, the success rate depends on how unwell you are when you require the operation.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Diverticular disease can be difficult to diagnose from the symptoms, alone because there are other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . \n As a first step, your GP may recommend\u00a0 blood tests  to rule out other conditions such as\u00a0 coeliac disease  (a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten) or  bowel cancer . \n In some cases, you may be offered treatment for IBS and diverticular disease at the same time. \n Colonoscopy \n To make sure there is not a more serious cause of your symptoms, your GP may refer you for a colonoscopy, where a\u00a0thin tube with a camera at the end (a colonoscope) is inserted into your rectum and guided into your colon. Before the procedure begins, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels. \n A colonoscopy is not usually painful,\u00a0but it\u00a0can feel uncomfortable. You may be\u00a0offered painkilling medication\u00a0and a\u00a0sedative beforehand to make you feel more relaxed and help\u00a0reduce any discomfort. \n CT pneumocolon or colonography \n Another technique for confirming the presence of diverticula is a  computerised tomography (CT scan) . A CT scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body. \n As with a colonoscopy, you will be given a laxative to clear out your bowels before you have the CT scan. \n Unlike a regular CT scan, the colonography scan involves a tube being inserted into your rectum, which is used to\u00a0pump some air\u00a0up into your rectum. The CT scan is then taken with you lying on your front, and again lying on your back. \n You may need to have an injection of contrast dye before the scan, but this is not always necessary. \n Diverticulitis \n If you have had a previous history of diverticular disease, your GP will usually be able to diagnose diverticulitis from your symptoms and a\u00a0physical examination. A blood test may be taken, because a high number of white blood cells indicates infection. If your symptoms are mild, your GP will treat it at home and you should recover within 4\u00a0days. \n Further tests will be needed if you have no previous history of diverticular disease. \n If you are unwell, your GP may refer you to hospital for blood tests and investigations.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Dry mouth", "introduction": "It's normal to occasionally have a dry mouth if you\u2019re dehydrated or feeling nervous, but a persistently dry mouth can be a sign of an underlying problem. \n You should see your dentist or GP if you have an unusually\u00a0dry mouth (known as xerostomia) so they can try to determine the cause. \n What can cause a dry mouth? \n A dry mouth can occur when\u00a0the salivary glands in your mouth don't produce enough saliva. \n This\u00a0is often the result of  dehydration , which means you don\u2019t have enough fluid in your body to produce the saliva you need. It's also common for your mouth to become dry if you're feeling anxious or nervous. \n A dry mouth can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem or medical condition, such as: \n \n medication \u2013\u00a0many different medications can cause a dry mouth, including  antidepressants ,\u00a0antihistamines and diuretics; check the leaflet that comes with your medicine, or find it in the  medicines section \u00a0to see if dry mouth is listed as a side effect \n a blocked nose \u2013\u00a0breathing through your mouth while you sleep can cause it to dry out \n  diabetes \u00a0\u2013 a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high \n  radiotherapy \u00a0to the head and neck \u2013 this can cause the salivary glands to become inflamed (mucositis) \n  Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome \u00a0\u2013 a condition where the immune system attacks and damages the salivary glands \n \n If you see your dentist or GP, let them know about any other symptoms you're experiencing and any treatments you\u2019re having, as this will help them work out why your mouth is dry. \n What problems can a dry mouth cause? \n Saliva plays an important role in keeping your mouth healthy. If you have a dry mouth, you may experience a number of other problems too, such as: \n \n a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth \n dry lips \n bad breath (halitosis) \n a decreased or altered sense of taste \n recurrent mouth infections, such as\u00a0 oral thrush  \n  tooth decay  and\u00a0 gum disease  \n difficulty speaking, eating or swallowing \n \n It\u2019s important to maintain good\u00a0 oral hygiene  if you have a dry mouth to reduce the risk of dental problems. You should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on. \n Treating a dry mouth \n Treating the underlying cause \n If your doctor or dentist is able to determine what's causing your dry mouth, treating this may improve your symptoms. \n For example, if medication is suspected as the cause of your dry mouth, your doctor may reduce your dose or suggest trying an alternative medication. \n Some of the conditions mentioned above\u00a0have specific treatments, such as nasal\u00a0 decongestants  for a blocked nose and insulin for diabetes. \n Things to try yourself \n There are simple measures you can\u00a0try to help keep your mouth moist. For example, it may help to: \n \n increase your fluid intake \u2013 take regular sips of cold water or an unsweetened drink \n suck on sugar-free sweets or chew sugar-free gum \u2013 this can stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva \n suck on ice cubes \u2013 the ice will melt slowly and moisten your mouth \n avoid alcohol (including alcohol-based mouthwashes), caffeine and smoking \u2013 these can all make a dry mouth worse \n \n Saliva substitutes and stimulants \n If the measures above don\u2019t help, your dentist, GP\u00a0or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute to keep your mouth moist. This may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. Use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals. \n If your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome,\u00a0a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed. This is taken as a tablet several times a day to\u00a0help stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva. \n However, pilocarpine isn't suitable for everyone, as it may cause side effects, such as sweating or  headaches .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

You can reduce your risk by making sure you maintain high standards of hygiene. \n For example, you should: \n \n wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after going to the toilet and before eating or preparing food \n clean the toilet, including the handle and the seat, with disinfectant after each bout of diarrhoea \n avoid sharing towels, flannels, cutlery, or utensils with other household members \n \n It's also important to\u00a0practise good food and water hygiene while travelling\u00a0abroad, such as avoiding potentially unsafe tap water and undercooked food. \n Read more about  preventing diarrhoea .", "symptoms": "Diarrhoea is where you frequently pass watery or loose poo.

This is an operation to remove part of the stomach\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, as a\u00a0treatment for\u00a0 stomach cancer .", "treatment": "Diarrhoea will usually clear up without treatment after a few days, particularly if it's caused by an infection. \n In children, diarrhoea will usually pass within 5\u00a0to 7\u00a0days and will rarely last longer than 2\u00a0weeks. \n In adults, diarrhoea usually improves within 2\u00a0to 4\u00a0days, although some infections can last a week or more. \n While waiting for your diarrhoea to pass, you can ease your symptoms by following the advice\u00a0outlined below. \n Drink fluids \n It's\u00a0important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid  dehydration , particularly if you're also vomiting. Take small, frequent sips of water. \n Ideally, adults should drink a lot of liquids that contain water, salt, and sugar. Examples are water mixed with juice and soup broth. If you're drinking enough fluid, your urine will be light yellow or almost clear. \n It's also very important for babies and small children not to become dehydrated. Give your child frequent sips of water, even if they are vomiting. A small amount is better than none.\u00a0 \n Fruit juice or\u00a0fizzy drinks should be avoided as they can make diarrhoea worse in children. \n If you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby and they have diarrhoea, you should continue to feed them as normal. \n Contact your GP immediately\u00a0if you or your child develop any  symptoms of dehydration . \n Oral rehydration solutions \n Your GP or pharmacist may suggest using an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to\u00a0prevent dehydration if you're at risk\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if you're frail or elderly. ORS can also be used to treat dehydration that has already occurred. \n Rehydration\u00a0solutions usually come in sachets available\u00a0from your local pharmacist\u00a0without a prescription. They are dissolved\u00a0in water and replace salt, glucose, and other important minerals that are lost\u00a0if you are\u00a0dehydrated. \n Children \n Your GP or pharmacist may recommend giving\u00a0your child an ORS\u00a0if they are dehydrated or at risk of becoming dehydrated. \n The usual recommendation is for\u00a0your child\u00a0to drink an ORS each time they have an episode of diarrhoea. The amount they should drink will depend on their size and weight. \n Your pharmacist can advise you about this. The manufacturer's instructions should\u00a0also give information about the recommended dose. \n You may be able to give your baby an ORS if they become dehydrated, but check with your GP, pharmacist, or health visitor first. \n Eating \n Opinion is divided over when and what you should eat if you have diarrhoea. However, most experts agree you should eat solid food as soon as you feel able to. Eat small, light meals and avoid fatty or spicy foods. \n Good examples are potatoes, rice, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables. Salty foods help the most. \n You don't need to eat if you've lost your appetite, but you should continue to\u00a0drink fluids and eat as soon as you feel able to. \n Children \n If your child is dehydrated, do not give them any solid food until they have drunk enough fluids. Once they have stopped showing signs of dehydration, they can start eating their normal diet. \n If your child is not dehydrated, offer them their normal diet. If they refuse to eat, continue to give them\u00a0fluids and wait until their appetite returns. \n Medication \n Antidiarrhoeal medicines \n Antidiarrhoeal medicines may help reduce your diarrhoea and slightly shorten how long it lasts. However, they're not usually necessary. \n Loperamide is the main antidiarrhoeal medicine used,\u00a0as it has been shown to be effective and causes few side effects. \n Loperamide slows down the muscle movements in your gut so\u00a0more water is absorbed from your stools. This makes your stools firmer and they're passed less frequently. \n An alternative to loperamide is\u00a0a different type of antidiarrhoeal medicine called\u00a0racecadotril, which works by reducing the amount of water produced by the small intestine. Evidence suggests this medication may be as effective as loperamide for treating diarrhoea. \n Some antidiarrhoeal medicines can be bought from a pharmacy without a prescription. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine to find out whether it's suitable for you and what dose you should take. Ask your pharmacist for advice if you're unsure. \n Do not take antidiarrhoeal medicines if there is blood or mucus in your stools or you have a high temperature (fever).\u00a0Instead, you should contact your GP for advice. \n Most\u00a0antidiarrhoeal medicines should not be given to children. Racecadotril can be used in children over 3\u00a0months old if it's combined with oral rehydration and the other measures mentioned above, although not all doctors recommend it. \n Painkillers \n Painkillers will not treat\u00a0diarrhoea, but  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen \u00a0can help relieve a fever and a  headache . If necessary, you can give your child liquid paracetamol or ibuprofen. \n Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication to check if it's suitable for you or your child and find out the correct dose. Children under 16 years of age\u00a0should not be given aspirin. \n Antibiotics \n Treatment with\u00a0 antibiotics \u00a0is not recommended for diarrhoea if the cause is unknown. This is because antibiotics: \n \n will\u00a0not work if the diarrhoea is caused by a virus\u00a0 \n can cause unpleasant side effects\u00a0 \n can become less\u00a0effective at treating more serious conditions if they're repeatedly used to treat mild conditions \n \n Antibiotics may be recommended\u00a0if you have severe diarrhoea and a specific type of bacteria has been identified as the cause. \n They may also be used if you have an underlying health problem, such as a weakened immune system. \n Hospital treatment\u00a0 \n Occasionally, hospital treatment may be needed if you or your child are seriously\u00a0dehydrated. Treatment will involve administering fluids and nutrients directly into\u00a0a vein (intravenously). \n Treating the underlying cause \n If you've been diagnosed with a specific condition that's causing your diarrhoea, treating this may help improve your symptoms. \n For example: \n \n  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \u00a0can be treated with changes to your diet and medications \u2013 read more about\u00a0 treating IBS  \n inflammatory bowel disease\u00a0can be treated with medications that help reduce inflammation in the bowel \n  coeliac disease \u00a0can be treated by excluding foods containing gluten from your diet \u2013 read more about\u00a0 treating coeliac disease  \n bile acid malabsorption can be treated with medication that helps stop bile building up in the digestive system \n \n Read more about  common causes of diarrhoea .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Most cases of diarrhoea get better within a week and you may not need to visit your GP. \n Read more about  when to visit your GP if you have diarrhoea . \n The information below explains what will happen if you need to see your GP. \n Identifying the cause \n To identify what is causing your diarrhoea, your GP may ask you questions, such as: \n \n what your stools\u00a0are like\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, if they are very watery or contain blood \n how often you need to go to the toilet \n whether you have\u00a0other symptoms, such as a\u00a0high temperature (fever)\u00a0 \n whether you have been in contact with anyone else who has diarrhoea, or\u00a0recently travelled abroad\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this may mean you have picked up an infection \n whether you have recently eaten out anywhere\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this may mean you have  food poisoning  \n whether you're taking medication and\u00a0if it has recently changed\u00a0 \n whether you have been stressed or anxious recently \n \n Stool sample \n Your GP may ask you for a stool sample so\u00a0it can be analysed\u00a0for signs of an infection if you have: \n \n persistent diarrhoea that has lasted more than two weeks \n blood or pus in your stools\u00a0 \n symptoms that affect your whole body, such as a fever or  dehydration  \n a weakened immune system\u00a0\u2013 for example, because you have\u00a0 HIV \u00a0 \n recently travelled abroad \n recently been in hospital or been taking  antibiotics  \n \n Blood tests \n Your GP may suggest you have some\u00a0 blood tests  if they suspect\u00a0your diarrhoea is being caused by\u00a0an underlying health condition. \n For example, your blood can be tested for signs of inflammation, which may suggest inflammatory bowel disease. \n Read more about the  possible causes of diarrhoea . \n Rectal examination \n Your GP may recommend a digital rectal examination (DRE)\u00a0if you have unexplained persistent diarrhoea, particularly if you're over 50. \n During a\u00a0DRE, your GP will insert\u00a0a gloved\u00a0finger into your bottom to feel for any abnormalities.

See your GP if your eczema does not improve after using an over-the-counter preparation. \n Self-help \n There are also some self-help tips\u00a0that may help to control symptoms of discoid eczema, such as: \n \n avoiding soaps and detergents, including liquid soaps, bubble bath, shower gels and wet wipes \u2013 even if these do not obviously irritate your skin; you should use an emollient soap substitute instead \n protecting your skin from minor cuts (for example, by wearing gloves) as they may trigger discoid eczema \n taking daily lukewarm baths or showers \u2013 using an emollient when washing may reduce your symptoms, and remember to apply your treatments soon afterwards \n not scratching the patches \u2013 keeping your hands clean and your fingernails short may help reduce the risk of skin damage or infection from unintentional scratching \n making sure you use and apply your treatments as instructed by your GP or pharmacist \n \n If you suspect your skin is infected, for example because there is excessive weeping or tenderness in the patches of eczema, see your GP. Infection can spread quickly, and the use of topical corticosteroid creams can mask or further spread the infection. \n Emollients \n Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as eczema. \n Choice of emollient \n Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as: \n \n an ointment for very dry skin \n a cream or lotion for less dry skin \n an emollient to use instead of soap \n an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower \n one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body \n \n The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. \n Creams and lotions tend to be more suitable for red, inflamed (swollen) areas of skin. Ointments are more suitable for areas of dry skin that are not inflamed. \n If you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. If this is the case, your GP will be able to prescribe another product. \n How to use emollients \n Use your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms as they can help limit the return of your condition. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school. \n To apply the emollient: \n \n use a large amount \n don't rub it in, smooth it into the skin in the same direction that the hair grows instead \n for very dry skin, apply the emollient every two to three hours \n after a bath or shower, gently dry the skin and then immediately apply the emollient while the skin is still moist \n \n If you are exposed to irritants at work, make sure you apply emollients regularly during and after work. \n Don't share emollients with other people. \n Side effects \n Occasionally, some emollients can irritate the skin. If you have discoid eczema, your skin will be sensitive and can react to certain ingredients in over-the-counter emollients. If your skin reacts to the emollient, stop using it and speak to your GP, who can recommend an alternative product. \n Emollients added to bath water can make your bath very slippery, so take care getting in and out of the bath. \n Topical corticosteroids \n To treat the patches of discoid eczema, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (corticosteroid medication that is applied directly to your skin) to reduce the inflammation. \n You may be concerned about using medication that contains steroids. However, corticosteroids are not the same as anabolic steroids, which are sometimes used by bodybuilders and athletes. When used as instructed by your pharmacist or doctor, corticosteroids are a safe and effective treatment for discoid eczema. \n Choice of topical corticosteroid \n There are different strengths of topical corticosteroids that can be prescribed depending on the severity of your eczema. Discoid eczema usually needs a stronger type of corticosteroid than other types of eczema. \n You might be prescribed a cream to be used on visible areas, such as face and hands, and an ointment to be used at night or for more severe flare-ups. \n How to use topical corticosteroids \n When using corticosteroids, apply the treatment accurately to the affected areas. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, you should follow directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with the corticosteroid. \n Do not apply the corticosteroid more than twice a day. Most people will only have to apply it once a day.\u00a0 \n To apply the topical corticosteroid, take the following steps: \n \n apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes before applying the topical corticosteroid, until the emollient has soaked into your skin \n apply a\u00a0good amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area\u00a0\u00a0 \n use the topical corticosteroid until the inflammation has cleared up, unless otherwise advised by your GP \n \n Speak to your prescriber if you have been using a topical corticosteroid and your symptoms have not improved. \n Side effects \n Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild and short-lived burning or stinging sensation as you apply them. In rare cases, they may also cause: \n \n thinning of the skin \n changes in skin colour \n  acne  (spots) \n increased hair growth \n \n Most of these side effects will improve once treatment stops. \n Generally, using a stronger topical corticosteroid, or using a large amount of topical corticosteroid, will increase your risk of getting side effects. For this reason, you should use the weakest and smallest amount possible to control your symptoms. \n Corticosteroid tablets \n If you have a severe flare-up, your doctor may prescribe corticosteroid tablets to take for up to a week. \n If corticosteroid tablets are taken often or for a long time, they can cause a number of side effects, such as: \n \n reduced growth rate in children \n  high blood pressure  (hypertension) \n  osteoporosis  (brittle bones) \n  diabetes  \n \n For this reason, your doctor is unlikely to prescribe repeat courses of corticosteroid tablets without referring you to a specialist. \n Antibiotics \n If your eczema becomes infected, you may also be prescribed an antibiotic. \n Oral antibiotics \n If you have an extensive area of infected eczema, you may be prescribed an antibiotic to take by mouth. This is most commonly flucloxacillin, which is usually taken for one week. If you are allergic to penicillin, you might be given an alternative such as clarithromycin. \n Topical antibiotics \n If you have a small amount of infected eczema, you will normally be prescribed a topical antibiotic, such as fusidic acid. This means\u00a0the medicine is applied directly to the affected area of skin, in the form of an ointment or cream. \n Some topical antibiotics are available in creams or ointments that also contain topical corticosteroids. \n Topical antibiotics should normally be used for\u00a0up to 2\u00a0weeks as necessary. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines are a type of medicine that work by stopping the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. Your body often releases histamine when it comes into contact with an irritant. Histamine can cause a wide range of symptoms, including sneezing, watery eyes and itching. \n Antihistamines may be prescribed during flare-ups of discoid eczema to cope with the symptom of itching, particularly if it is interfering with your sleep. However, they will not treat the damaged skin. \n Many older types of antihistamines can make you drowsy, which can be useful if your symptoms affect the quality of your sleep. Otherwise, ask your pharmacist or GP to recommend one of the more modern \u201cnon-sedating\u201d antihistamines. \n Further treatments \n If the treatments prescribed by your GP are not successfully controlling your symptoms, they may refer you for assessment and treatment by a dermatologist (specialist in treating skin conditions). \n Further treatments that may be available from your dermatologist include: \n \n phototherapy \u2013 where the affected area of skin is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light to help reduce inflammation \n bandaging \u2013 where medicated dressings are applied to your skin \n immunosuppressant therapy \u2013 medicines that reduce inflammation by suppressing your immune system", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

It can cause blindness if left undiagnosed and untreated. \n However, it usually takes several years for diabetic retinopathy to reach a stage where it could threaten your sight. \n To minimise the risk of this happening, people with diabetes should: \n \n ensure they control their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol \n attend diabetic eye screening appointments \u2013 annual screening is offered to all people with diabetes aged 12 and over to pick up and treat any problems early on \n \n This page covers: \n  How diabetes can affect the eyes  \n  Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy?  \n  Symptoms of\u00a0diabetic retinopathy  \n  Diabetic eye screening  \n  Reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy  \n  Treatments for diabetic retinopathy  \n How diabetes can affect the eyes \n The retina is the light-sensitive layer of cells at the back of the eye that converts light into electrical signals. The signals are sent to the brain\u00a0and the\u00a0brain turns them into the images you see. \n The retina needs a constant supply of blood, which it receives through a network of tiny blood vessels. Over time, a persistently\u00a0high blood sugar level can damage these blood vessels in three main stages: \n \n tiny bulges develop in the blood vessels, which may bleed slightly but don\u2019t usually affect your vision \u2013 this is known as background retinopathy \n more severe and widespread changes affect the blood vessels, including more significant bleeding into the eye\u00a0\u2013 this is known as pre-proliferative retinopathy \n scar tissue and new blood vessels, which are weak and bleed easily, develop on the retina\u00a0\u2013 this is known as proliferative retinopathy and it can result in some\u00a0loss of vision \n \n However, if a problem with your eyes is picked up early, lifestyle changes and/or treatment can stop\u00a0it getting worse. \n Read about the\u00a0 stages of diabetic retinopathy  \n Am I at risk of diabetic retinopathy? \n Anyone with\u00a0 type 1 diabetes  or\u00a0 type 2 diabetes  is potentially at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy. \n You're at a greater risk if you: \n \n have\u00a0had diabetes for a long time \n have a persistently high blood sugar (blood glucose)\u00a0level \n have\u00a0 high blood pressure  \n have  high cholesterol  \n are pregnant \n are of Asian or Afro-Caribbean background \n \n By keeping your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control, you can  reduce your\u00a0chances\u00a0of developing diabetic retinopathy . \n Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy \n You won't usually notice diabetic retinopathy in the early stages, as\u00a0it doesn't tend to have\u00a0any obvious symptoms until\u00a0it's more advanced. \n However, early signs of the condition can be picked up by taking photographs of the eyes during\u00a0 diabetic eye screening . \n Contact your GP or diabetes care team immediately if you experience: \n \n gradually worsening vision \n sudden vision loss \n shapes floating in your field of vision (floaters) \n blurred or patchy vision \n eye pain or redness \n \n These symptoms don't necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it's important to get them checked out.\u00a0Don't wait until your next screening appointment. \n Diabetic eye screening \n Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years old or over\u00a0is invited for eye screening once a year. \n Screening is\u00a0offered because: \n \n diabetic retinopathy doesn't tend to cause any symptoms in the early stages \n the condition can cause permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly \n screening can detect problems in your eyes before they start to affect your\u00a0vision \n if problems are caught early, treatment can help prevent or reduce vision loss \n \n The screening test involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs. Depending on your result, you may be advised to return for another appointment a year later, attend more regular appointments, or discuss treatment options with a specialist. \n Read more about  diabetic eye screening  \n Reduce your risk of diabetic retinopathy \n You can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, or help prevent it getting worse, by: \n \n controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels \n taking your diabetes medication as prescribed \n attending all your screening appointments \n getting medical\u00a0advice quickly if you notice any changes to your vision \n maintaining a healthy weight, eating a  healthy, balanced diet ,  exercising regularly \u00a0and  stopping smoking  \n \n Read more about  how to prevent diabetic retinopathy . \n Treatments for diabetic retinopathy \n Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk. \n If the condition hasn't reached this stage, the above advice on managing your diabetes is recommended. \n The main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are: \n \n laser treatment \n injections of medication into your eyes \n an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes \n \n Read more about the  treatment of diabetic retinopathy", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Diabetic retinopathy usually only requires specific treatment when it reaches an advanced stage and there's a risk to your vision. \n It's\u00a0typically offered if\u00a0 diabetic eye screening \u00a0detects stage three (proliferative) retinopathy, or if you have symptoms caused by diabetic maculopathy. \n At all stages, managing your diabetes is crucial. \n Read about the\u00a0 stages of diabetic retinopathy \u00a0for more information about what these terms mean. \n Managing your diabetes \n The most important part of your treatment is to keep your diabetes under control. \n In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, controlling your diabetes can help prevent vision problems developing. \n In the more advanced stages, when your vision is affected or at risk, keeping your diabetes under control can help stop the condition getting worse. \n Read about  what you can do to reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy progressing  \n Treatments for advanced diabetic retinopathy \n For diabetic retinopathy that is threatening or affecting your sight, the main treatments are: \n \n  laser treatment \u00a0\u2013\u00a0to treat the growth of new blood vessels at the back of the eye (retina) in cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and to stabilise some cases of maculopathy \n  eye injections \u00a0\u2013\u00a0to treat severe maculopathy that's threatening your sight \n  eye surgery  \u2013 to remove blood or scar tissue from the eye if\u00a0laser treatment isn't possible because\u00a0retinopathy is too advanced \n \n Laser treatment \n Laser treatment is used to treat new blood vessels at the back of the eyes in the advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy. This is done because the new blood vessels tend to be very weak and often cause bleeding into the eye. \n Treatment\u00a0can help stabilise the changes in your eyes caused\u00a0by your diabetes and stop your vision getting any worse, although\u00a0it won't usually improve your sight. \n Laser treatment: \n \n involves shining a laser into your eyes \u2013 you'll be given  local anaesthetic  drops to numb\u00a0your eyes; eye drops are used to widen your pupils and special contact lenses are used to hold your eyelids open and focus the laser onto your retina \n normally takes around 20-40 minutes \n is usually\u00a0carried out\u00a0on an outpatient basis, which\u00a0means you won't need\u00a0to stay in hospital overnight\u00a0 \n may\u00a0require\u00a0more than one\u00a0visit to a laser treatment clinic \n isn't usually painful, although you may feel a sharp pricking sensation when certain areas of your\u00a0eye are being treated \n \n Side effects \n After treatment, you may have some side effects for a few hours.

These can help stop the problems in your eyes getting worse, and may also lead to an improvement in your vision. \n During treatment: \n \n the skin around your eyes\u00a0will be cleaned and\u00a0covered with a sheet \n small clips will be used to keep your eyes open \n you'll be given local anaesthetic\u00a0drops to numb your eyes \n a\u00a0very fine\u00a0needle is carefully guided into your eyeball and the injection\u00a0is given \n \n The injections are usually given once a month to begin with. Once your vision starts to stabilise, they'll be stopped or given less frequently. \n Injections of\u00a0 steroid medication \u00a0may sometimes be given\u00a0instead of\u00a0anti-VEGF injections, or if the anti-VEGF injections don't help. \n Risks and side effects \n Possible risks and side effects of anti-VEGF injections include: \n \n eye irritation or discomfort \n bleeding inside the eye \n floaters or a feeling of having something in your eye \n watery or dry,\u00a0itchy\u00a0eyes \n \n There's also a risk that the injections could cause\u00a0 blood clots  to form, which could lead to a\u00a0 heart attack  or  stroke . This risk is small, but it should be discussed with you before you give your consent to treatment. \n The main risk with steroid injections is increased pressure inside the eye. \n Eye surgery \n Surgery may be carried out to remove some of the\u00a0vitreous humour from the eye. This is\u00a0the transparent, jelly-like substance that fills the space behind the lens of the eye. \n The operation, known as vitreoretinal surgery, may be needed if: \n \n a large amount of blood has collected in your eye \n there's extensive scar tissue\u00a0that's likely to cause, or has already caused,\u00a0retinal detachment \n \n During the procedure, the surgeon will make a small incision in your eye before removing some of the vitreous humour, removing any scar tissue and using a laser to prevent a further deterioration in your vision. \n Vitreoretinal surgery is usually carried out under local anaesthetic and sedation. This means you will not experience any pain or have any awareness of the surgery being performed. \n After the procedure \n You should be able to go home on the same day or the day after your surgery. \n For the first few days, you may need to wear a\u00a0patch over\u00a0your\u00a0eye.\u00a0This is because activities such as reading and watching television can quickly tire your eye to begin with. \n You will probably have blurred vision after the operation. This should improve gradually, although it may take several months for your vision to fully return to normal. \n Your surgeon will advise you about any activities you\u00a0should avoid during your recovery. \n Risks and side effects \n Possible risks of vitreoretinal surgery include: \n \n developing a\u00a0cataract \n further bleeding into the eye \n retinal detachment \n fluid build-up in the cornea (outer layer at the front of the eye) \n infection in the eye \n \n There's also a small chance that you will need further retinal surgery afterwards.

When these stressful events happen, you\u00a0have a higher risk of becoming\u00a0depressed\u00a0if you stop seeing your friends and family and you\u00a0try to deal with your problems on your own. \n Illness \n You may have a higher risk of\u00a0depression if you\u00a0have a\u00a0longstanding\u00a0or life-threatening illness, such as\u00a0 coronary heart disease  or  cancer . \n Head injuries are also an often under-recognised cause of depression. A\u00a0 severe head injury  can trigger mood swings and emotional problems. \n Some people may have an\u00a0 underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) \u00a0resulting from\u00a0problems with their immune system. In rarer cases a\u00a0 minor head injury  can damage the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland at the base of\u00a0your brain that produces thyroid-stimulating hormones. \n This can cause a number of symptoms, such as extreme tiredness\u00a0and\u00a0a loss of\u00a0interest in sex (loss of libido), which can in turn\u00a0lead to\u00a0depression.\u00a0 \n Personality \n You may\u00a0be\u00a0more vulnerable to\u00a0depression\u00a0if you have\u00a0certain personality traits,\u00a0such as\u00a0low self-esteem or being overly self-critical. This may be\u00a0because of\u00a0the genes you've inherited from your parents, or because of your early life experiences.\u00a0 \n Family history \n If someone else in your family has suffered from depression in the past, such as a parent or sister or brother, then it's more likely you will too. \n Giving birth \n Some women are particularly vulnerable to\u00a0depression after pregnancy. The hormonal and physical changes, as well as added responsibility of a new life, can lead to  postnatal depression . \n Loneliness \n Becoming\u00a0cut off from your family and friends\u00a0can\u00a0increase your risk of\u00a0depression. \n Alcohol and drugs \n Some people try to cope when life is getting them down by  drinking too much alcohol  or taking drugs. This can result in a spiral of\u00a0depression.\u00a0 \n Cannabis helps you relax, but there is evidence that it can bring on depression, especially in teenagers. \n And don't be\u00a0tempted to drown your sorrows\u00a0with a drink. Alcohol is categorised as a \"strong depressant\" and actually makes depression worse.", "treatment": "Talking treatments \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) helps you understand your thoughts and behaviour and how they affect you. \n CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. \n It teaches you how to overcome\u00a0negative thoughts, for example being able to challenge hopeless feelings. \n CBT\u00a0is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem that it has been shown to help. \n You normally have a\u00a0short course\u00a0of sessions, usually six to eight sessions, over 10 to 12 weeks on a one-to-one basis with a counsellor trained in CBT. In some cases, you may be offered group CBT. \n Online\u00a0CBT \n Computerised CBT is a form of CBT that works through a computer screen, rather than face-to-face with a therapist. \n It's delivered\u00a0in a series of weekly sessions and should be supported by a healthcare professional. For instance, it's usually prescribed by your GP and you may have to use the surgery computer to access the programme. \n Interpersonal therapy (IPT) \n IPT focuses on your relationships with other people and on problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. \n There's some evidence that IPT can be as effective as\u00a0antidepressants\u00a0or CBT, but more research is needed. \n Psychodynamic psychotherapy \n In psychodynamic (psychoanalytic) psychotherapy, a psychoanalytic therapist will encourage you to say whatever is going through your mind. \n This will help you to become aware of hidden meanings or patterns in what you do or say that may be contributing to your problems. Read more about  psychotherapy . \n Counselling \n Counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you are experiencing in your life to find new ways of dealing with them. Counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems, but do not tell you what to do. \n Counselling on the NHS usually\u00a0consists of six\u00a0to 12 hour-long sessions.\u00a0You talk in confidence to a counsellor, who\u00a0supports you and offers practical advice. \n Counselling is\u00a0ideal for people who are basically healthy but need help coping with a current crisis, such as anger, relationship issues, bereavement, redundancy, infertility or the onset of a serious illness. \n Getting help \n Your first port of call should be your GP, who can refer you for NHS talking treatments for depression available locally. \n In some parts of the country, you also\u00a0have\u00a0the option of self-referral. This\u00a0means that if you\u00a0prefer not to talk to\u00a0your GP, you\u00a0can\u00a0go directly to a professional therapist. \n Antidepressants \n  Antidepressants \u00a0are medicines that treat the symptoms of depression. There are almost 30 different kinds available. \n Most people with moderate or severe depression benefit from antidepressants, but not everybody does.\u00a0You may\u00a0respond to one antidepressant but not to another,\u00a0and you\u00a0may need to try two or more treatments before\u00a0you\u00a0find one that works for you. \n The different types of antidepressant work about as well as each other. However,\u00a0side effects vary\u00a0between different treatments and\u00a0people. \n When you start taking antidepressants, you should see your GP or specialist nurse every week or two for at least four weeks to see how well they are working. If\u00a0they are working, you'll need to\u00a0continue taking them at the same dose for at least four to six months after your symptoms have eased. \n If you've had bouts of depression in the past, you\u00a0may\u00a0need to\u00a0continue to\u00a0take antidepressants for up to five years or longer. \n Antidepressants aren't addictive, but you may\u00a0get some withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or you miss a dose (see below). \n Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \n If your GP thinks you would benefit from taking an antidepressant, you'll usually be prescribed a modern type called a\u00a0 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) . Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are Seroxat (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine)\u00a0and Cipramil (citalopram). \n They help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a \"good mood\" chemical. \n SSRIs\u00a0work\u00a0just as well\u00a0as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects. \n They can, however, cause nausea and headaches, as well as a\u00a0dry mouth and problems\u00a0having sex. However, all these negative effects usually improve over time. \n Some SSRIs\u00a0aren't suitable for\u00a0children under the age of 18. Research shows that the risk of\u00a0 self-harm  and suicidal behaviour may increase if they're taken by under-18s. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can\u00a0be prescribed for under-18s, and even then only when a specialist has given the go-ahead. \n Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) \n This group of antidepressants is used to treat moderate to severe depression. \n TCAs, which includes Imipramil (imipramine) and amitriptyline,\u00a0have been around for longer than SSRIs. \n They\u00a0work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood.\u00a0 \n They're generally quite safe, but it's a bad idea to smoke cannabis\u00a0if you are taking TCAs because it can cause your heart to beat rapidly. \n Side effects of TCAs\u00a0may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, light-headedness and excessive drowsiness, but vary from person to person. \n The side effects\u00a0usually ease after\u00a0seven to 10 days, as your body gets used to the medication. \n Other antidepressants \n New antidepressants, such as Efexor (venlafaxine),\u00a0Cymbalta or Yentreve (duloxetine)\u00a0and\u00a0Zispin Soltab\u00a0(mirtazapine), work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs. \n Venlafaxine and duloxetine\u00a0are known as SNRIs (serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors). Like TCAs,\u00a0they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. \n Studies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, though\u00a0they're not routinely prescribed as\u00a0they can lead to a rise in blood pressure. \n Withdrawal symptoms \n Antidepressants are not addictive in the same\u00a0way that\u00a0illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but when you stop taking them you may have some withdrawal symptoms, including: \n \n upset stomach \n flu-like symptoms \n anxiety \n dizziness \n vivid dreams at night \n sensations in the body that feel like electric shocks \n \n In most cases these are quite mild and last no longer than a week or two, but occasionally\u00a0they can be quite severe. They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and\u00a0venlafaxine (Efexor). \n Withdrawal symptoms occur very soon after stopping the tablets, so can easily be told apart from symptoms of depression relapse, which tend to occur after a few weeks. \n Other treatments \n St John's wort \n St John's wort is a herbal treatment that some people take for depression. It's available from health food shops and pharmacies. \n There's some evidence that it may help mild\u00a0to moderate depression, but\u00a0it's not recommended by doctors. This is because the amount\u00a0of active ingredients varies among individual brands and batches, so\u00a0you can never\u00a0be sure\u00a0what sort of effect it\u00a0will have on you. \n Taking St John's wort with other medications, such as anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, can also cause serious problems. \n You shouldn't\u00a0take St John's wort if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, as we don't know for sure that it's safe. \n Also, St John's wort can interact with the contraceptive pill, reducing its contraceptive effect.\u00a0Read more about  St John's wort . \n Electric shock treatment \n Sometimes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be recommended if you have severe depression and other treatments, including antidepressants, haven't worked. \n During ECT, you'll first be given an anaesthetic and medication to relax your muscles. Then you'll receive an electrical \"shock\" to your brain through electrodes placed on your head. \n You may be given a series of ECT sessions. It is usually given twice a week for\u00a0three to six\u00a0weeks. \n For most people,\u00a0ECT is good for\u00a0relieving severe depression, but the beneficial\u00a0effect tends to wear off after several months. \n Some people\u00a0get unpleasant side effects, including short-term headaches, memory problems, nausea and muscle aches. \n Read more information about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on the  Mind website . \n Lithium \n If you've tried several different antidepressants and had no improvement, your doctor may offer you a type of medication called lithium in addition to your current treatment. \n There are two types of lithium: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you are taking one that works for you, it's best not to change. \n If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high,\u00a0it can become toxic. You will therefore need blood tests every three months to check your lithium levels while you're on the medication. \n You'll also need to avoid\u00a0eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic.\u00a0Ask your GP for advice about your diet.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day, every day for more than two weeks, you should seek help from your GP. \n It is especially important to speak to your GP if you experience: \n \n symptoms of depression that are not improving \n your mood affects your work, other interests, and\u00a0relationships with\u00a0your family and friends \n thoughts of\u00a0 suicide  or self-harm \n \n Sometimes, when people are depressed they\u00a0find it hard to\u00a0imagine that treatment can actually help. But the sooner you seek treatment, the sooner\u00a0your depression will lift. \n There are no physical tests for depression, though your GP may examine you\u00a0and do some urine or\u00a0 blood\u00a0tests  to rule out other conditions that have similar symptoms, such as an  underactive thyroid . \n The main way in which your GP will\u00a0tell if you have depression is by asking you lots of questions about your general health and how the\u00a0way you are feeling\u00a0is affecting you mentally and physically. \n Try to be as open as you can be with the doctor. Describing your symptoms and how they are affecting you will really help your GP understand if you have depression and how severe it is. \n Read more about the  symptoms of depression . \n Any discussion you have with your GP will be confidential.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Dementia with Lewy bodies", "introduction": "Dementia with Lewy bodies is a common form of dementia estimated to affect more than 100,000 people in the UK. \n The term \"dementia\" describes a loss of mental ability (cognitive impairment) associated with gradual death of brain cells. It's rare in anyone younger than 65. \n Symptoms\u00a0usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of\u00a0several\u00a0years. \n Signs and symptoms \n People with dementia with Lewy bodies not only experience problems with memory and judgement, like those with  Alzheimer's disease , but are also likely to\u00a0have difficulties with concentration and visual perception (recognising objects and making judgements about where they are in space). \n They may experience: \n \n slowed movement, stiff limbs, and tremors \n recurrent visual\u00a0hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) \n sleep disturbances, including sleepiness during the day \n fainting, unsteadiness, and\u00a0 falls  \n \n People with the condition\u00a0tend to swing from a state of alertness to drowsiness or staring into space. These extreme changes may be unpredictable and happen from hour to hour or day to day. \n Read more about the  symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies  \n What causes dementia with Lewy bodies? \n Dementia with Lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an\u00a0abnormal protein called Lewy bodies inside brain cells. These deposits, which are also found in people with\u00a0 Parkinson\u2019s disease , build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement. \n It's not clear why the deposits develop and how exactly they damage the brain, but it's thought\u00a0they disrupt the brain's normal functions by interfering with chemical signals transmitted from one brain cell to another. \n Dementia with Lewy bodies usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, although\u00a0there have been reports of rare cases that seem to run in families. \n Diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies \n If you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment, and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. \n Your GP can do some simple checks to see if there is chance you could have dementia, and they can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist clinic if necessary. \n At one of these clinics,\u00a0you will be asked about your symptoms and have a physical check-up and memory test. You may also have\u00a0 blood tests  and brain scans. \n The results of these checks and tests will give your doctor a good idea as to whether your symptoms are caused by\u00a0dementia with Lewy bodies, another type of dementia, or\u00a0something else\u00a0entirely. \n Read more\u00a0about  how dementia with Lewy bodies is diagnosed  \n How dementia with Lewy bodies is managed \n There is no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies or any\u00a0medication that will slow it down. \n However, a few different medicines can be effective in controlling some of the symptoms. In particular,\u00a0acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (used to treat  Alzheimer's disease ) have been shown to improve symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion in some people. \n Supportive\u00a0treatments\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0physiotherapy,  occupational therapy , and speech and language\u00a0therapy\u00a0\u2013 can help improve any problems with movement, everyday tasks, and communication. \n Psychological therapies and specific\u00a0 dementia activities , such as memory caf\u00e9s, can also help\u00a0with memory loss, confusion, and feelings of disorientation. \n Read more about  treating dementia with Lewy bodies  \n Outlook \n How quick dementia with Lewy bodies progresses varies from person to person. Home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home. \n The average survival after the time of diagnosis is similar to that of Alzheimer's disease\u00a0\u2013 around five to eight years. However, as with Alzheimer's disease, this can be highly variable. \n If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, remember that you are not alone. The NHS, social services, and voluntary organisations will be able to provide advice and support to help you and your family.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies usually develop gradually and become more severe over the course of a few years. \n Like other forms of dementia, the\u00a0condition causes problems with: \n \n thinking speed \n language \n understanding \n judgement \n memory (although significant memory loss may not occur until later on) \n \n People with\u00a0dementia with Lewy bodies may also have other symptoms that can help distinguish it from other types of dementia, such as: \n \n extreme swings\u00a0between alertness\u00a0and confusion or drowsiness, which may happen unexpectedly and change from hour to hour or day to day \n slow movement, stiff limbs, and\u00a0tremors (as seen in  Parkinson's disease ), which cause shuffling when walking \n seeing or hearing things that aren't\u00a0real (hallucinations), which can\u00a0range from\u00a0pleasant to distressing \n fainting, unsteadiness, and\u00a0 falls \u00a0 \n sleep disturbances, which\u00a0can cause talking in your sleep or acting out dreams \n loss of facial expression \n difficulty\u00a0swallowing\u00a0 (dysphagia)  \n  depression \u00a0 \n \n These symptoms can make daily activities very difficult and can lead to further health problems, such as injuries from falls, and\u00a0 chest infections  caused by accidentally inhaling\u00a0food instead of swallowing it.\u00a0 \n Seeking medical advice \n If you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP.

This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16. \n It may also help to: \n \n avoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse \n try eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth \n use a soft toothbrush and temporarily avoid flossing around the affected tooth \n \n These measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn't use them to delay getting help from a dentist. \n Treatments for a dental abscess \n Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus. \n Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include: \n \n removing the affected tooth (extraction) \u2013 this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn't possible \n root canal treatment \u2013 a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it \n incision and drainage \u2013 where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed) \n \n  Local anaesthetic  will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under  general anaesthetic \u00a0(where you're asleep). \n  Antibiotics  aren't routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe. \n What causes dental abscesses? \n Your mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque. \n If you don't keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to\u00a0 tooth decay  or  gum disease . \n The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess: \n \n poor oral hygiene \u2013 plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don't floss and brush your teeth regularly \n consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink \u2013 these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess \n an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums \u2013 bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums \n having a weakened immune system \u2013 this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as\u00a0 diabetes ,\u00a0and\u00a0those having treatment, including\u00a0 steroid medication \u00a0or  chemotherapy \u00a0 \n \n Preventing dental abscesses \n You can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. \n To do this, you should: \n \n use floss or an interdental brush at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line \n brush your teeth with a\u00a0fluoride toothpaste twice a day \u2013\u00a0spending at least two minutes each time \n avoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away \u2013 just spit out any excess toothpaste \n cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks \u2013\u00a0particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed \n visit your dentist regularly \u2013 your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health\u00a0 \n \n Read more on\u00a0 how to keep your teeth clean \u00a0and  dental check-ups .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

Over many years, the lungs become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly. \n Most cases of cystic fibrosis in the UK are now identified through screening tests carried out soon after birth. It's estimated that 1 in every 2,500 babies born in the UK\u00a0has cystic fibrosis. \n A number of treatments are available to help reduce the problems caused by the condition,\u00a0but unfortunately average\u00a0life expectancy is reduced for people who have it. \n \u00a0 \n Symptoms of cystic fibrosis \n Symptoms of cystic fibrosis tend to start in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop very\u00a0soon after birth, or may not be obvious until adulthood. \n Some of the main symptoms of cystic fibrosis can include: \n \n recurring\u00a0 chest infections  \n difficulty putting on weight \n frequent, wet-sounding\u00a0 coughs  \n  diarrhoea  \n occasional wheezing and\u00a0 shortness of breath  \n \n People with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, including  diabetes ,\u00a0thin, weakened bones ( osteoporosis ) and liver problems. \n Read more about the  symptoms of cystic fibrosis  \n Causes of cystic fibrosis \n Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both of their parents. \n The faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways. \n To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit two copies of this faulty gene \u2013 one from each of their parents. Their parents will not usually have the condition themselves, because they will only carry one faulty gene and one that works normally. \n If both parents carry the faulty gene, there's a 25% chance that each child they have will be born with cystic fibrosis. \n Read more about the  causes of cystic fibrosis  \n Screening and testing for cystic fibrosis \n Most cases of cystic fibrosis are now detected soon after birth through the\u00a0 newborn blood spot test . \n This involves collecting a drop of blood from the baby's heel and testing it for\u00a0abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis. \n More tests\u00a0will be needed to confirm the diagnosis, such as: \n \n a sweat test \u2013 to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal \n a genetic test \u2013 where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis \n \n These tests can also be carried out in older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who haven't been screened previously. \n If you have a family history of cystic fibrosis, you can be tested to determine if you're at risk of having a child with the condition by checking if you're a\u00a0\"carrier\" of the faulty gene that causes it. \n Read more about  how cystic fibrosis is diagnosed  \n Treatments for cystic fibrosis \n There's currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a number of treatments are available to help control the symptoms, prevent\u00a0complications, and make the condition easier to live with. \n Possible treatments include: \n \n  antibiotics \u00a0to prevent and treat\u00a0 chest infections  \n medicines\u00a0to\u00a0make the mucus in the lungs thinner and easier to cough up \n medicines to widen the airways and reduce inflammation \n special techniques and devices to help clear mucus from the lungs \n medicines that help the person absorb food better \n following a special diet and taking supplements to prevent  malnutrition  \n \n A\u00a0 lung transplant  may eventually be needed if the lungs become greatly damaged. \n Read more about  treating cystic fibrosis  \n Outlook for cystic fibrosis \n Cystic fibrosis is a progressive condition, which means it tends to get worse over time. \n Eventually the condition can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly. \n The outlook for cystic fibrosis has improved considerably in recent years\u00a0because of\u00a0advancements in treatment, although most people with cystic fibrosis will have a shorter-than-average life expectancy. \n Currently, about half of the people with cystic fibrosis will live past the age of 40. Children born with the condition nowadays are likely to live longer than this. \n Information about you \n If you or your child has\u00a0cystic fibrosis, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child\u00a0on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

The lungs and digestive system are the main areas that are affected. \n Symptoms tend to start in early childhood,\u00a0but sometimes they can develop soon after birth\u00a0and very occasionally\u00a0they may not be obvious until adulthood. \n Nowadays, cystic fibrosis is usually\u00a0diagnosed before symptoms appear, through screening tests carried out soon after birth. Read more about  screening for\u00a0cystic fibrosis . \n The main problems associated with cystic fibrosis are outlined below. \n Lung problems \n Cystic fibrosis can cause sticky mucus to clog the lungs and airways. This can cause: \n \n recurring  chest infections  \u2013 these occur because mucus in the lungs is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria \n persistent inflammation of the airways, which can cause them to become abnormally widened ( bronchiectasis ) \n increased\u00a0 coughing  \n occasional wheezing and\u00a0 shortness of breath  \n \n Over time, the lungs can become increasingly damaged and may eventually stop working properly. \n Digestive system problems \n The mucus can also block parts of the digestive system, which\u00a0can affect how food travels through the gut and how it's\u00a0broken down or absorbed. \n This can cause: \n \n a serious bowel obstruction\u00a0in the first few days of life (meconium ileus)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this will often need an operation to remove the blockage \n jaundice \n  diarrhoea  or large, smelly stools \n problems putting on weight and growing\u00a0\u2013 this can occur because the body\u00a0struggles to\u00a0digest and absorb nutrients ( malnutrition ) \n  diabetes  from late childhood or early adulthood\u00a0\u2013 this can develop if the pancreas becomes severely damaged \n \n Other problems \n People with cystic fibrosis can also\u00a0experience a number of other problems, including: \n \n  sinusitis  \n nasal polyps \n thin,\u00a0weakened bones ( osteoporosis )\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can occur as a result of repeated infections, poor growth, lack of physical activity and malnutrition \n swelling and pain in the joints ( arthritis  or arthralgia) from late childhood \n difficulty conceiving children \u2013 most men with cystic fibrosis are unable to have children naturally (although some fertility treatments may still work) because the tubes that carry sperm don't develop correctly; women can become pregnant, however \n liver problems caused by\u00a0the tiny bile ducts in the liver becoming blocked by mucus \n leaking of small amounts of urine, particularly during coughing fits ( stress incontinence )", "causes": "Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both their parents. \n The faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways \u2013 particularly the lungs and digestive system. \n The condition is present from birth and cannot be caught from someone else who has it. \n How cystic fibrosis is inherited \n Genes come in pairs. You inherit one set from your mother and one set from your father. \n To be born with cystic fibrosis, a child has to inherit a copy of the faulty gene from both of their parents. \n This can happen if\u00a0the parents are \"carriers\" of the faulty gene. This means they don't have cystic fibrosis themselves, but they can have a child with the condition if their partner also carries the faulty gene. \n It's estimated that around 1 in every 25 people in the UK are carriers of the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis. \n If both parents are carriers, there's a: \n \n 25% chance that each child they have will not inherit any faulty genes and won't have\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0or be able to pass it on \n 50% chance that each child they have will just inherit one copy of the faulty gene from one parent and be a carrier \n 25% chance that each child they have will inherit copies of the faulty gene from both parents and will have\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0 \n \n This is known as an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.", "treatment": "There's currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but it's possible to help control the symptoms, prevent or reduce complications, and make the condition easier to live with. \n A person with cystic fibrosis will be supported by a\u00a0team of healthcare professionals at a specialist cystic fibrosis centre. A care plan will be drawn up that's tailored to their individual needs. \n A range of treatments may be\u00a0used and sometimes treatment in hospital will be needed. Regular appointments to monitor the condition will also be recommended. \n Some of the main treatments for cystic fibrosis include: \n Medications for lung problems \n People with cystic fibrosis may need to take a number of different medicines to treat and prevent lung problems. These may be swallowed, inhaled or injected. \n Some of the main medicines for cystic fibrosis are: \n \n  antibiotics  to prevent and treat\u00a0 chest infections  \n medicines to make the sticky mucus in the lungs thinner, such as dornase alfa, hypertonic saline and mannitol dry powder \n a medicine called ivacaftor to help reduce the levels of mucus in the body \u2013 although this is only suitable for fewer than 1 in every 20 people (4%) with cystic fibrosis \n  bronchodilators  to widen the airways and help make breathing easier \n  steroid medication  to treat\u00a0nasal polyps\u00a0(small growths inside the nose) \n \n It's also\u00a0important that people with cystic fibrosis are up to date with all  routine vaccinations  and have the\u00a0 flu jab \u00a0each year once they're old enough. \n Airway clearance techniques \n In addition to medication, special techniques can be used to help keep the lungs and airways clear. A physiotherpist\u00a0can give you advice. \n Some of the main techniques include: \n \n active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) \u2013 a technique that involves a sequence of relaxed breathing, followed by deep breathing exercises and then huffing \n autogenic drainage \u2013 a series of gentle breathing techniques that clear mucus from the lungs \n modified postural drainage \u2013 a technique that involves changing your position to make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs \n airway clearance devices \u2013 handheld devices that use vibration and air pressure to help remove mucus from your airways; you may have to pay in the region of \u00a345-60 for one of these devices \n \n Your care team can provide more information on the techniques mentioned above.\u00a0 \n Dietary and nutritional advice \n For people with cystic fibrosis, getting the right nutrition is vital in helping them develop normally and stopping them becoming frequently ill. \n However, the majority of people with cystic fibrosis cannot digest food and absorb nutrients from when they're a baby. Occasionally, the condition can cause the pancreas to become damaged over time, causing the same problem. \n A dietitian will advise on what you can do to help avoid  malnutrition . They may recommend: \n \n taking digestive enzyme capsules with all meals and snacks to help with digestion \u2013 the number of capsules needed depends on the food being eaten and varies from person to person \n following a special balanced diet that's high in calories (energy), fat and protein \n taking\u00a0vitamin and mineral supplements \n \n The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has information on\u00a0 eating well with cystic fibrosis . It also has\u00a0 various factsheets, including nutrition advice for adults and children .\u00a0 \n Lung transplants \n In severe cases of cystic fibrosis, when the lungs stop working properly and all medical treatments have failed to help, a  lung transplant  may be recommended. \n A lung transplant is a serious operation that carries risks, but it can greatly improve the length and quality of life for people with severe cystic fibrosis. \n The outlook for people with cystic fibrosis is often better than for many transplant patients, as they're often younger and in better general health. It's\u00a0estimated that up to 9 out of 10 people will survive for at least a year after a transplant. \n The Cystic Fibrosis Trust has information on  lung transplants in cystic fibrosis . \n Treatments for associated problems \n People with cystic fibrosis can have a number of other problems that may benefit from treatment. \n For example: \n \n exercise can help keep bones and joints healthy, and is recommended for everyone with\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0any sport or exercise is usually good, but if you're not sure about a particular activity, you should ask your physiotherapist for advice \n medicines called bisphosphonates can help treat weak and brittle bones that may occur as a result of cystic fibrosis if the person doesn't get enough\u00a0vitaminD and calcium\u00a0(from their diet and/or from supplements) \n insulin medication and a special diet may help someone with  diabetes  caused by\u00a0cystic fibrosis control their blood sugar levels", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Tests can be carried out to diagnose cystic fibrosis at any age. \n Most cases are now detected soon after birth through newborn screening, but older children and adults with symptoms of cystic fibrosis who weren't screened can also have tests to check for the condition. \n Tests to find out if you are a \"carrier\" of the faulty gene responsible for\u00a0cystic fibrosis\u00a0may also be recommended for some people. \n Newborn screening \n A\u00a0 newborn blood spot test  is now offered to all babies in England to help detect problems early on, including cystic fibrosis. \n When your baby is five to eight days old, a health professional will prick their heel and collect drops of blood on a special card. The blood is then sent to a laboratory to be checked for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis. \n You should receive the results by the time your baby is six to eight weeks old. You will be contacted sooner if a problem is found, and you'll be asked to attend a hospital appointment. \n The screening result isn't 100% accurate, so more tests will be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. You, your partner and any other children you have may also be tested to see if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis (see below). \n Confirming\u00a0a diagnosis \n Tests to confirm a diagnosis will be carried out if screening suggests that your child may have cystic fibrosis, or your doctor thinks you could have the condition and you haven't been screened previously. \n Two main tests can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis: \n \n sweat test \u2013 a test to measure the amount of salt in sweat, as the sweat of someone with cystic fibrosis has higher levels of salt than normal \n genetic test \u2013 where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis \n \n The sweat test is most commonly used, although\u00a0genetic testing may be done if the sweat test result is inconclusive or to identify the specific genetic fault that's causing the condition. \n Carrier testing \n Testing to\u00a0find out if you carry the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis may be useful if: \n \n you\u00a0have a close relative, such as a child, sibling or parent,\u00a0who's a known carrier \n you\u00a0have a close relative\u00a0with cystic fibrosis \n your partner is known to carry the\u00a0cystic fibrosis gene \n \n This can be done using a blood test, or occasionally a special mouthwash, to collect a sample of cells. The sample is then sent to a laboratory so it can be checked for the faulty gene. \n Finding out whether you're a carrier of the faulty gene can help determine if you're at risk of having a child with cystic fibrosis.\u00a0A genetic counsellor\u00a0will explain the results of the test\u00a0to you and discuss the implications and options available for\u00a0future pregnancies."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Dehydration", "introduction": "Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in. \n When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it\u00a0upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions. \n Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion,\u00a0flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy. \n Some of the early warning signs of\u00a0dehydration include: \n \n feeling\u00a0thirsty and lightheaded \n a\u00a0dry mouth \n tiredness \n having dark coloured, strong-smelling urine \n passing urine less often than usual \n \n A baby may be dehydrated if they: \n \n have a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head \n have few or no tears when they cry \n have fewer wet nappies \n are drowsy \n \n The body\u00a0is affected\u00a0even when you lose a small amount of fluid. \n Read more about the  symptoms of dehydration  \n What causes dehydration? \n Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in\u00a0hot weather)\u00a0and your diet can contribute to dehydration. \n You can also\u00a0become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as\u00a0persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or\u00a0sweating from a fever. \n Read more about the  causes of dehydration  \n Who is at risk from dehydration? \n Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include: \n \n babies and infants \u2013 they have a low body weight and are sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss \n older people \u2013 they may be less aware that they are becoming dehydrated and need to keep drinking fluids \n people with a long-term health condition \u2013 such as  diabetes  or  alcoholism  \n athletes \u2013 they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods\u00a0 \n \n What to do \n If you're dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids\u00a0such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts. \n If you're finding it difficult to keep water down because you're vomiting,\u00a0try drinking small amounts more frequently. \n Infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is\u00a0because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems. \n Instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child. \n If left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death. \n Read more about  treating dehydration  \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated. \n If your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a  blood test  or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. \n Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or\u00a0 NHS 24 111  service straight away if you have any of the following symptoms: \n \n extreme thirst \n feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused \n not passing urine for eight hours \n rapid heartbeat \n dizziness when you stand up that doesn't go away after a few seconds \n \n You should also contact your GP if your baby has had\u00a0six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.", "symptoms": "Dehydration can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on how much of your body weight is lost through fluids. \n Two early signs of dehydration are\u00a0 thirst  and dark-coloured urine. This is the body's way of\u00a0trying to increase water intake and decrease water loss. \n Other symptoms may include: \n \n dizziness or light-headedness \n  headache \u00a0 \n tiredness \n  dry mouth , lips and eyes \n passing small amounts of urine\u00a0infrequently (less than three or four\u00a0times a day) \n \n Dehydration can\u00a0also\u00a0lead to\u00a0a\u00a0loss of\u00a0strength and stamina. It's\u00a0a main\u00a0cause of heat exhaustion. \n You should be able to reverse dehydration at this stage\u00a0by drinking\u00a0more fluids. \n If dehydration is ongoing (chronic), it can affect your kidney function and increase the risk of\u00a0 kidney stones . It can also lead to muscle damage and  constipation . \n When to see your GP \n See your GP if your symptoms continue despite drinking fluids, or if you suspect that your baby or toddler is dehydrated. \n You should also contact your GP if your baby has\u00a0had\u00a0six or more episodes of diarrhoea\u00a0in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours. \n If dehydration is suspected, you may be given a\u00a0 blood test  or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. \n Severe dehydration \n If dehydration is left untreated, it can become severe. \n Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. \n Contact your GP,\u00a0out-of-hours service\u00a0or\u00a0 NHS 24 111 \u00a0service\u00a0straight away if you have any of the following symptoms: \n \n feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused, and you think you may be dehydrated \n dizziness when you stand up that doesn't go away after a few seconds \n not passing urine for eight hours \n a weak pulse \n a rapid pulse \n  fits (seizures)  \n a low level of conciousness \n \n If\u00a0severe\u00a0dehydration is not treated immediately, it can lead to complications. This level of dehydration needs hospital treatment and you will be put on a drip to restore the substantial loss of fluids. \n Dehydration in babies \n A baby may be dehydrated if they have: \n \n a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head \n few or no tears when they cry \n a dry mouth \n fewer wet nappies \n dark yellow urine \n drowsiness \n fast breathing \n cold and blotchy-looking hands and feet \n \n Read about  how to treat dehydration in babies", "causes": "Dehydration is caused by not drinking enough fluid or by losing more fluid than you take in. Fluid is lost through sweat, tears, vomiting, urine or diarrhoea. \n The severity of dehydration\u00a0can\u00a0depend on a number of factors,\u00a0such as climate, level of physical activity and diet. \n There are several causes of dehydration, which are described below. \n Illness \n Dehydration is often the result of an illness, such as  gastroenteritis , where fluid is lost through persistent bouts of  diarrhoea  and vomiting. \n Sweating \n You can also become dehydrated if you sweat excessively after a fever, exercise, or carrying out heavy, manual work in hot conditions. \n In these situations, it's important to drink regularly to replace lost fluids. It doesn't necessarily need to be hot for you to lose a significant amount of fluid from sweating. \n Children and teenagers are particularly at risk because they may ignore the  symptoms of dehydration , or not know how to recognise and treat them. \n Alcohol \n Dehydration can also occur as a result of drinking too much  alcohol . Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you wee more. \n The headache associated with a hangover indicates that your body is dehydrated. You should try to drink plenty of water when you have been drinking alcohol. \n Diabetes \n If you have diabetes, you're at risk of becoming dehydrated because you have high levels of glucose in your bloodstream. Your kidneys will try to get rid of the glucose by creating more urine, so your body becomes dehydrated from going to the toilet more frequently. \n Read more about the different  types of diabetes  \n Who's at risk? \n The groups of people most at risk of dehydration are: \n \n babies and infants \u2013 their low body weight makes them sensitive to even small amounts of fluid loss \n older people \u2013 they may be less aware they're becoming dehydrated and need to drink fluids \n people with a long-term health condition \u2013 such as  diabetes  or\u00a0alcoholism \n athletes \u2013 they can lose a large amount of body fluid through sweat when exercising for long periods \n \n Hyponatremia \n It's possible to become overhydrated while exercising. This is known as hyponatremia and it's caused by low sodium (salt) levels in the blood. It can occur if too much water is drunk over a short period of time. \n Hyponatremia sometimes affects athletes whose blood sodium level is reduced through sweat and then diluted by drinking large amounts of water. \n Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting and  headache . In serious cases, the brain can swell, causing confusion, seizures,  coma  and, in rare cases, death.", "treatment": "The best way to treat dehydration is to rehydrate the body by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, diluted squash or diluted fruit juice. \n A sweet drink can help to replace lost sugar, and a salty snack can help to replace lost salt. \n Babies \n If your baby is dehydrated, take\u00a0them to see your GP\u00a0as soon as possible. They'll be able to recommend appropriate treatments, such as those outlined below. \n Give\u00a0your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula. It can often be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more frequently. \n Don't dilute your baby's formula (if you use it). Babies who are formula-fed\u00a0and those on solids can be\u00a0given extra water. \n Avoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly\u00a0if they have diarrhoea and vomiting,\u00a0because it can\u00a0make it worse. \n Giving your baby regular sips\u00a0(a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution (ORS)\u00a0in addition to their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk\u00a0and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars. \n Infants and children \n Infants and children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given solely water, because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse. Instead, they should have diluted squash or a special ORS (see below). \n If you or your child is finding it difficult to hold down fluids because of vomiting, take smaller amounts more frequently.\u00a0You may find it easier to\u00a0use a spoon or a syringe to give your child small amounts of fluid. \n Read more about\u00a0 vomiting in adults  and  vomiting in children and babies  \n Oral rehydration solutions \n When\u00a0you're dehydrated, you lose sugar and salts, as well as water. Drinking a rehydration solution\u00a0will enable you to re-establish the right balance of body fluids. The solution should contain a mixture of potassium and sodium salts, as well as glucose or starch. \n There are several different rehydration products available over the counter from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP, including solutions that are suitable for infants and children. \n Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice about the most suitable rehydration solution for you or your child. \n Severe dehydration \n Seek\u00a0immediate\u00a0medical\u00a0help if you suspect someone is severely dehydrated (see  symptoms of severe dehydration ). \n They may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.

Adults can also get croup but this is rare. \n The condition is more common during the\u00a0late autumn and early winter months.\u00a0 \n It\u00a0tends to affect more boys than girls. \n A child may experience croup more than once during childhood. \n Treating croup \n Most cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. \n A\u00a0single dose of an oral corticosteroid medication called dexamethasone or prednisolone will usually also be prescribed to help reduce the swelling in the throat. \n If your child has breathing problems they may need hospital treatment, such as adrenaline and oxygen through a mask. \n Read more about  treating croup  \n Complications \n Most\u00a0cases\u00a0of croup clear up within 48 hours.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Deep vein thrombosis", "introduction": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops within a deep vein in the body, usually in the leg. \n  Blood clots \u00a0that\u00a0develop in\u00a0a vein are also known as venous thrombosis. \n DVT usually occurs in a deep leg vein,\u00a0a larger vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh. \n It can cause pain and\u00a0swelling in the leg and may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. This is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs. \n DVT and pulmonary embolism together are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). \n Symptoms of DVT \n In some cases, there may be no\u00a0symptoms of DVT. If symptoms do occur they can include: \n \n pain, swelling and tenderness in one of\u00a0your legs (usually your calf) \n a heavy ache in the affected area \n warm skin in the area of the clot \n red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee \n \n DVT usually (although not always)\u00a0affects one\u00a0leg. The pain may be worse when you bend your foot upward towards your knee. \n Pulmonary embolism \n If\u00a0left untreated, about 1\u00a0in 10 people with a DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a very serious condition which causes: \n \n  breathlessness \u00a0\u2013 which may come on gradually or suddenly \n chest pain\u00a0\u2013 which may become worse when you breathe in \n sudden collapse\u00a0 \n \n Both DVT and pulmonary embolism require urgent investigation and treatment. \n Seek immediate medical attention if you have pain, swelling and tenderness in your leg and you develop breathlessness and chest pain. \n Read more about the  complications of DVT  \n What causes DVT? \n Each year,\u00a0DVT affects around 1\u00a0person in every 1,000 in the UK. \n Anyone can develop\u00a0DVT, but\u00a0it becomes more common over the age of 40. As well as age, there are also a number of other risk factors, including: \n \n having a history of DVT or pulmonary embolism \n having a family history of blood clots \n being inactive for long periods\u00a0\u2013 such as after an operation or during a long journey \n blood vessel damage\u00a0\u2013 a damaged blood vessel wall can result in the formation of a blood clot \n having certain\u00a0conditions or treatments\u00a0that cause your blood to clot more easily than normal\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as cancer (including  chemotherapy  and\u00a0 radiotherapy  treatment), heart and lung disease, thrombophilia and Hughes syndrome \n being pregnant\u00a0\u2013 your blood also clots more easily during pregnancy \n being overweight or\u00a0 obese  \n \n The\u00a0 combined contraceptive pill  and\u00a0hormone replacement therapy (HRT)\u00a0both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. If you're taking either of these, your risk of developing DVT is\u00a0slightly increased. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of DVT  \n Diagnosing DVT \n See your GP as soon as possible if\u00a0you think you may have DVT\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg.\u00a0They'll ask you about your\u00a0symptoms and medical history. \n D-dimer test \n It\u00a0can be\u00a0difficult to diagnose DVT from symptoms alone, so your GP may advise that you have a specialised\u00a0 blood test  called a D-dimer test. \n This test detects pieces of blood clot that have been broken down and are loose in your bloodstream. The larger the number of fragments found, the more likely it is that you have a blood clot in your vein. \n However, the D-dimer test isn't always reliable because blood clot fragments can increase after an operation, injury or during pregnancy. Additional tests, such as\u00a0an ultrasound scan, will need to be carried out to confirm DVT. \n Ultrasound scan \n An\u00a0 ultrasound scan  can be used to detect clots in your veins. A special type of ultrasound called a Doppler ultrasound can also be used to find out how fast the blood is flowing through a blood vessel. This helps doctors identify when blood flow is slowed or blocked, which could be caused by a blood clot. \n Venogram \n A venogram may be used if the results of a D-dimer test and ultrasound scan can't confirm a diagnosis of DVT. \n During a venogram, a liquid called a contrast dye is injected into a vein in your foot. The dye travels up\u00a0the leg and can be detected by  X-ray , which will highlight\u00a0a gap in\u00a0the blood vessel where a clot is stopping the flow of blood. \n Treating DVT \n Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines, which reduce the blood's ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger. \n Heparin and\u00a0warfarin are 2 types of anticoagulant often used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting. After initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming. \n A number of anticoagulants, known as directly acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), may also be used to treat conditions such as DVT. These medications include rivaroxaban and apixaban, and they've been shown to be as effective as heparin and warfarin with less serious side effects. \n You'll also be prescribed compression stockings to wear every day, which will improve your symptoms and help prevent complications. \n Read more  about treating DVT  \n Preventing DVT \n If you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you're there. \n If you're at risk of developing DVT, there are a number of things you can do to prevent a blood clot occurring, both before you go into hospital, such as temporarily stopping taking the combined contraceptive pill,\u00a0and while you're in hospital, such as wearing compression stockings. \n When you leave hospital, your care team may also make a number of recommendations to help prevent DVT returning or complications developing. These may include: \n \n  not smoking  \n  eating a healthy, balanced diet  \n  taking regular exercise \u00a0 \n maintaining a healthy weight or\u00a0losing weight if you're\u00a0 obese  \n \n There's no evidence to suggest that taking aspirin reduces your risk of developing DVT. \n See your GP before embarking on long-distance travel if you're at risk of getting a DVT, or if you've had a DVT in the past. \n When taking a long-distance journey\u00a0(6 hours or more) by plane, train or car, you should take steps to avoid getting DVT, such as drinking plenty of\u00a0water, performing\u00a0simple leg exercises and taking regular, short walking breaks. \n Read more about\u00a0 preventing DVT", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) sometimes occurs for no apparent reason. \n However, the risk of developing DVT is increased in certain circumstances. \n Inactivity\u00a0 \n When you're inactive your blood tends to collect in the lower parts of your body, often in your lower legs. This is usually nothing to worry about because when you start to move, your blood flow increases and moves evenly around your body. \n However, if you're unable to move for a long period of time\u00a0\u2013 such as after an operation, because of\u00a0an illness or injury, or during a long journey\u00a0\u2013\u00a0your blood flow can slow down considerably. A slow blood flow increases the chances of a\u00a0 blood clot  forming. \n In hospital \n If you have to go into hospital for an operation or procedure, your risk of getting a blood clot increases. This is\u00a0because DVT is more likely to occur when you're unwell or inactive, or less active than usual. \n As a patient, your risk of developing DVT depends on\u00a0the type of treatment you're having. You may be at increased risk of DVT if any of the following apply: \n \n you're having an operation that takes longer than 90 minutes, or 60 minutes if the operation is on your leg, hip or abdomen \n you're having an operation for an inflammatory or abdominal condition, such as\u00a0 appendicitis  \n you're confined to a bed, unable to walk, or spending a large part of the day in a bed or chair for at least three days \n \n You may also be at increased risk of DVT if you're much less active than usual because of an operation or serious injury and have other DVT risk factors, such as a family history of the condition. \n When you're admitted to hospital you'll be assessed for your risk of developing a blood clot and, if necessary, given preventative treatment. \n Blood vessel damage \n If the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, it may become narrowed or blocked, which can cause a blood clot to form. \n Blood vessels can be damaged by injuries such as broken bones or severe muscle damage. Sometimes, blood vessel damage that occurs during surgery can cause a blood clot, particularly in operations on the lower half of your body. \n Conditions such as\u00a0vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels),  varicose veins  and some forms of medication, such as  chemotherapy ,\u00a0can also damage blood vessels. \n Medical and genetic conditions \n Your risk of getting DVT is increased if you have a condition that causes your blood to clot more easily than normal. These conditions include: \n \n cancer \u2013 cancer treatments such as\u00a0chemotherapy and\u00a0 radiotherapy  can increase this risk further \n  heart disease \u00a0and lung disease \n infectious conditions, such as hepatitis \n inflammatory conditions, such as\u00a0 rheumatoid arthritis  \n thrombophilia\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition where your blood has an increased tendency\u00a0to clot \n antiphospholipid syndrome\u00a0\u2013 an immune system disorder that causes an increased risk of blood clots\u00a0 \n \n Pregnancy \n During pregnancy, blood clots more easily. It's the body's way of preventing too much blood being lost during childbirth. \n Venous thromboembolism (VTE)\u00a0\u2013 DVT and pulmonary embolism\u00a0\u2013 affects about 1\u00a0in 100,000 women of childbearing age. \n DVTs are also rare in pregnancy, although\u00a0pregnant women are up to 10 times more likely to develop thrombosis than non-pregnant women of the same age. A clot can form at any stage of pregnancy and up to 6\u00a0weeks after the birth. \n Having thrombophilia (a condition where the blood has an increased tendency to clot), or having a parent, or brother or sister, who's had a thrombosis, increase your risk of developing a DVT during pregnancy. \n Other risk factors during pregnancy include: \n \n being over 35 years old \n being\u00a0 obese  (with a BMI of 30 or more) \n expecting 2 or more babies \n having recently had a\u00a0caesarean section \n being immobile for long periods of time \n smoking (find out how to  stop smoking ) \n having severe  varicose veins  \n  dehydration  \n \n Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is usually used to treat pregnant women with DVT. LMWH is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents the blood clot getting bigger. It's given by injection and doesn't affect your developing baby. \n Contraceptive pill and HRT \n The\u00a0 combined contraceptive pill \u00a0and\u00a0 hormone replacement therapy (HRT) \u00a0both contain the female hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen causes the blood to clot a bit more easily than normal,\u00a0so your risk of getting DVT is slightly increased. There's no increased risk from the progestogen-only contraceptive pill. \n Other causes \n Your risk of getting DVT is also\u00a0increased if you or a close relative have previously had DVT and: \n \n you're overweight or obese \n you smoke \n you're dehydrated \n you're over 60\u00a0\u2013 particularly if you have a condition that restricts your mobility", "treatment": "If you have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), you'll need to take a medicine called an anticoagulant. \n Anticoagulation \n Anticoagulant medicines\u00a0prevent  blood clots  getting bigger.\u00a0They can also help stop part of the blood clot breaking off and becoming lodged in another part of your bloodstream (an embolism). \n Although they're often referred to as \"blood-thinning\" medicines, anticoagulants don't actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily. \n Heparin and warfarin are 2 types of anticoagulants that are used to treat DVT. Heparin is usually prescribed first because it works immediately to prevent further clotting.\u00a0After this initial treatment, you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming. \n Heparin \n Heparin is available in 2\u00a0different forms: \n \n standard (unfractioned) heparin \n low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) \n \n Standard (unfractioned) heparin can be given as: \n \n an intravenous injection\u00a0\u2013 an injection straight into one of your veins \n an intravenous infusion\u00a0\u2013 where a continuous drip of heparin (via a pump)\u00a0is fed through a narrow tube into a vein in your arm (this must be done in hospital) \n a subcutaneous injection\u00a0\u2013 an injection under your skin \n \n LMWH is usually given as a subcutaneous injection. \n The dose of standard (unfractionated) heparin to treat a blood clot varies significantly from person to person, so the dosage must be carefully monitored and adjusted if necessary. You may need to stay in hospital for 5 to 10 days and have frequent\u00a0 blood tests  to ensure you receive the right dose. \n LMWH\u00a0works differently from standard heparin. It contains small molecules, which means its effects are more reliable and you won't have to stay in hospital and be monitored. \n Both standard heparin and LMWH can cause side effects, including: \n \n a skin rash and other\u00a0 allergic reactions  \n bleeding\u00a0 \n weakening of the bones if taken for a long time (although rare with LMWH) \n \n In rare cases, heparin can also cause an extreme reaction that makes existing blood clots worse and causes new clots to develop.\u00a0This reaction, and weakening of your bones, is less likely to occur when\u00a0taking LMWH. \n In most cases, you'll be given LMWH\u00a0because\u00a0it's easier to use and causes fewer side effects. \n Warfarin \n  Warfarin \u00a0is taken as a tablet. You may need to take it after initial treatment with heparin\u00a0to prevent further blood clots occurring. Your doctor may recommend that you take warfarin for 3\u00a0to 6 months. In some cases, it may need to be taken for longer,\u00a0even for\u00a0life. \n As with standard heparin, the effects of warfarin vary from person to person. You'll need to be closely monitored by having frequent blood tests to ensure you're taking the right dosage. \n When you first start taking warfarin, you may need to have 2 to 3\u00a0blood tests a week until your regular dose is decided. After this, you should only need to have a blood test every 4\u00a0weeks at an anticoagulant outpatient clinic. \n Warfarin can be affected by your diet, any other medicines you're taking, and by how well your liver is working. \n If you're taking warfarin you should: \n \n keep your diet consistent \n limit the amount of\u00a0 alcohol  you drink (no more than 14 units of alcohol a week) \n take your dose of warfarin at the same time every day \n not start to take any other medicine without checking with your GP, pharmacist or anticoagulant specialist \n not take herbal medicines \n \n Warfarin isn't recommended for pregnant women who are given heparin injections for the full length of treatment. \n Rivaroxaban \n Rivaroxaban is a medication recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0as a possible treatment for adults with DVT, or to help prevent recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism. \n Rivaroxaban comes in tablet form. It's a type of anticoagulant known as a\u00a0directly acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC). It prevents blood clots forming by inhibiting a substance called factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin (an enzyme that helps blood clot). \n Treatment usually lasts 3\u00a0months and involves taking rivaroxaban twice a day for the first 21 days and then once a day\u00a0until\u00a0the end of the course. \n Read the  NICE guidance about rivaroxaban  \n Apixaban \n NICE also recommends\u00a0apixaban as a possible method of treatment and prevention for DVT and pulmonary embolism. \n Like\u00a0rivaroxaban, apixaban is a DOAC that's taken orally as a tablet, and prevents blood clots forming by hindering factor Xa and restricting the formation of thrombin. \n Treatment usually lasts at least 3 months and involves taking apixaban twice a day. \n Read the  NICE guidance about apixaban  \n Compression stockings \n Wearing compression stockings helps prevent calf pain and swelling, and lowers the risk of ulcers developing after having DVT. \n They can also help prevent post-thrombotic syndrome. This is damage to leg tissue caused by the increase in venous pressure that occurs when a vein is blocked by a clot and blood is diverted to the outer veins. \n After having DVT, stockings should be worn every day for at least 2\u00a0years. This is because symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome may develop several months or even years after having a DVT. \n Compression stockings should be fitted professionally and your prescription should be reviewed every 3 to 6\u00a0months. The stockings need to be worn all day but can be taken off before going to bed or in the evening while you rest with your leg raised. A spare pair of compression stockings should also be provided. \n Exercise \n Your healthcare team will usually advise you to walk regularly once compression stockings have been prescribed. This can help prevent symptoms of DVT returning and may help to improve or prevent complications of DVT, such as post-thrombotic syndrome. \n Raising your leg \n As well as wearing compression stockings, you might be advised to raise your leg whenever you're resting. This helps to relieve the pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf itself. \n When raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. This will help the returning blood flow from your calf. Putting a cushion underneath your leg while you're\u00a0lying down\u00a0should help raise your leg above the level of your hip. \n You can also slightly raise the end of your bed to ensure that your foot and calf are slightly higher than your hip. \n Read more about  preventing DVT  \n Inferior vena cava filters \n Although anticoagulant medicines and compression stockings are usually the only treatments needed for DVT, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters may be used as an alternative. This is\u00a0usually because anticoagulant treatment needs to be stopped, isn't suitable, or isn't working. \n IVC filters are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. They trap large fragments of a blood clot and stop it travelling to the heart and lungs. They can be used\u00a0to help prevent blood clots developing in the legs of people diagnosed with: \n \n DVT \n pulmonary embolism \n multiple severe injuries \n \n IVCs\u00a0can be placed in the vein permanently, or newer types of filters can be placed temporarily and removed after the risk of a blood clot has decreased. \n The procedure to insert an IVC filter is carried out using\u00a0a  local anaesthetic  (where you're awake but the area is numb). A small cut is made in the skin and a catheter (thin, flexible\u00a0tube) is inserted into a vein in the neck or groin area. The\u00a0catheter is guided using an  ultrasound scan . The IVC filter is then\u00a0inserted through the catheter and into the vein.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Crohn's disease", "introduction": "Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. \n Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon). \n Common\u00a0symptoms can\u00a0include: \n \n  diarrhoea  \n  abdominal pain  \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n unintended weight loss \n blood and mucus in your faeces (stools) \n \n People with Crohn's disease sometimes go for long periods\u00a0without symptoms or with very mild symptoms. This is known as remission. Remission can be followed by periods where symptoms flare up and become particularly troublesome. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of Crohn's disease \u00a0and  diagnosing Crohn's disease . \n Why it happens \n The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, research suggests a combination of factors may be responsible.\u00a0These include: \n \n genetics \u2013 genes you inherit from your parents may increase your risk of developing Crohn's disease \n the immune system \u2013 the inflammation may be caused by a problem with\u00a0the immune system (the body's defence against infection and illness) that causes it to\u00a0attack healthy bacteria in the gut \n previous infection \u2013 a previous infection may trigger an abnormal response from the immune system \n smoking \u2013\u00a0smokers with Crohn's disease usually have more severe symptoms than non-smokers \n environmental factors \u2013 Crohn's disease is most common in westernised countries such as the UK, and least common in poorer parts of the world such as Africa, which suggests the environment (particularly sanitation) has a part to play \n \n Read more about the possible  causes of Crohn's disease . \n Treating Crohn's disease \n There's currently no cure for Crohn's disease, so the aim of treatment\u00a0is to stop the inflammatory process, relieve symptoms (induce and maintain remission) and avoid surgery wherever possible. \n The first treatment offered to reduce symptoms is usually steroid medication ( corticosteroids ). If\u00a0this doesn't\u00a0help, medication to suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) and medication to reduce inflammation may be used. \n In\u00a0some cases, surgery\u00a0may be needed to remove\u00a0the inflamed section of intestine. \n Once your symptoms are under control (in remission), further medication may be needed to help maintain this. \n Who is affected? \n Crohn's disease is a relatively\u00a0uncommon condition. There are currently at least 115,000 people living with the condition in the UK. \n Crohn's disease\u00a0can affect people of all ages, including children. However, most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30.\u00a0 \n A large number of cases\u00a0also develop between the\u00a0ages of\u00a060 and 80. \n It affects slightly more women than men, but in children more boys are affected than girls. \n The condition\u00a0is more common in white people than in black or Asian people. It's most prevalent among Jewish people of European descent. \n Read more about  treating Crohn's disease . \n Complications \n Over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system, resulting in complications such as narrowing of the intestine (stricture), or a channel developing between the end of the\u00a0bowel and the skin near the anus or vagina (fistula). These problems usually require surgical treatment. \n Read more about the possible  complications of Crohn's disease . \n Information about you \n If you have Crohn's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register .", "symptoms": "The symptoms of Crohn's disease vary, depending on which part of the digestive system is inflamed. \n Common symptoms include: \n \n recurring  diarrhoea  \n  abdominal pain \u00a0and cramping, which\u00a0is usually worse after eating \n extreme tiredness (fatigue) \n unintended weight loss \n blood and mucus in your faeces (stools) \n \n You may experience all or only one of the above. Some people experience severe symptoms, but\u00a0others only\u00a0have mild problems. \n There may be long periods, lasting for weeks or months, where you have very mild or no symptoms (known as remission), followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome (known as flare-ups or relapses). \n Less common symptoms include: \n \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100F) or above \n feeling sick (nausea) \n being sick (vomiting) \n joint pain and swelling ( arthritis ) \n inflammation and irritation of the eyes (uveitis) \n areas of painful, red and swollen skin\u00a0\u2013 most often the legs \n mouth ulcers \n \n Children with Crohn's disease may grow at a slower rate than expected, because the inflammation can prevent the body absorbing nutrients from food. \n When to seek medical advice \n You should contact your GP if you have: \n \n persistent diarrhoea \n persistent abdominal pain \n unexplained weight loss \n blood in your stools \n \n You should also see your GP if you're concerned about your child's development.", "causes": "The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Most researchers think it's caused by a combination of factors. \n These are thought to be: \n \n genetics \n the immune system \n smoking \n previous infection \n environmental factors \n \n There's no evidence to suggest a particular diet can cause Crohn's disease, although dietary changes can control certain symptoms and may be recommended by your specialist or dietitian. \n Read about\u00a0 treatment for Crohn's disease  for more information. \n Genetics \n There's evidence to suggest genetics plays a role in the development of Crohn's disease. \n Researchers have identified\u00a0more than\u00a0200 different genes that are more common in people with Crohn's disease than in the general population. \n There's also evidence that Crohn's disease can\u00a0run in families. About 3 in 20 people with the condition have a close relative (mother, father, sister or brother) who also has Crohn's disease. For example, if you have an identical twin with the condition, you have a 70% chance of developing it. \n The fact that Crohn's disease is more common in some ethnic groups than in others also suggests that genetics plays an important role. \n The immune system \n The immune system provides protection against harmful bacteria that could potentially find their way into the digestive system. \n The digestive system is also home to\u00a0many different types of so-called \"friendly bacteria\" that help to digest food. The immune system\u00a0usually recognises these bacteria and lets them do their job without attacking them. \n However, in Crohn's disease, it seems that something disrupts the immune system, which sends a special protein known as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) to kill\u00a0all bacteria, regardless of whether they're friendly or not. This causes\u00a0most of the inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. \n Previous infection \n In certain genetically susceptible individuals, a previous childhood infection may lead to an abnormal immune response, causing the symptoms of Crohn's disease. \n Smoking \n Aside from family history and ethnic background, smoking is the most important risk factor for Crohn's disease. Smokers are twice as likely to develop the condition than non-smokers. \n Furthermore, people with Crohn's disease who smoke usually experience more severe symptoms and are much more likely to require surgery. \n Read about  how to get help\u00a0to stop smoking . \n Environmental factors \n There are 2\u00a0unusual aspects of Crohn's disease that have led many researchers to believe that environmental factors may play a role. These are explained below: \n \n Crohn's disease is a \"disease of the rich\". The highest number of cases occurs in developed parts of the world, such as the UK and the US, and the\u00a0lowest number occur in developing parts of the world, such as Africa and Asia. \n Crohn's disease became much more widespread from the 1950s onwards. \n \n This suggests there is something\u00a0associated with modern Western lifestyles that increases a person's risk of developing the condition. \n One theory to explain this is known as the hygiene hypothesis. It suggests that as children grow up in increasingly germ-free environments, their immune system doesn't fully develop\u00a0because of\u00a0a lack of exposure to childhood infections. However, there's little in the way of hard scientific evidence to support this theory. \n An alternative theory is the cold-chain hypothesis, which suggests that the increase in Crohn's disease cases might be linked to the increased use of refrigerators after the Second World War.", "treatment": "There's currently no cure for Crohn's disease, but treatment can improve the symptoms. \n The main aims of treatment are to: \n \n reduce symptoms\u00a0\u2013\u00a0known as inducing remission (remission is a period without symptoms) \n maintain remission \n \n In children, treatment also aims to promote healthy growth and development. \n Your treatment will usually be provided by a range of healthcare professionals, including specialist doctors (such as gastroenterologists or surgeons), GPs and specialist nurses. \n Reducing symptoms \n If you have Crohn's disease and it's causing moderate or severe symptoms, this is known as an \"active disease\". Treatment for active Crohn's disease usually involves medication, but surgery is sometimes the best option. \n Initial treatment \n In most cases, the first treatment offered is steroid medication (corticosteroids) to reduce the inflammation. Examples of corticosteroids used for Crohn's disease include prednisolone tablets or hydrocortisone injections. \n These medications are often effective in reducing the symptoms of Crohn's disease, but they can have significant side effects, such as: \n \n weight gain \n swelling of the face \n increased vulnerability to infections \n thinning and weakening of the bones (osteopenia and  osteoporosis ) \n \n Because of\u00a0these possible side effects, your dose will be gradually reduced when your symptoms start to improve. \n If you prefer, you may be able to choose to have a milder steroid called budesonide, or a type of medication called a 5-aminosalicylate (such as mesalazine), as an alternative initial treatment. These medications have fewer side effects, but they're less effective. \n In children or young people, where there are concerns about growth and development, a special liquid diet may be recommended as an initial treatment. This is known as an elemental or polymeric diet, and it can reduce inflammation by allowing your digestive system to recover while ensuring you get all the nutrients\u00a0you need. \n Additional treatment \n If your symptoms\u00a0flare\u00a0up\u00a0twice or more during 12 months, or return when your steroid dose is reduced,\u00a0further treatment may be necessary. \n In these cases, medicines to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants)\u00a0may be combined with your initial medication. Medicines\u00a0called azathioprine or mercaptopurine are most commonly used. \n These medicines aren't suitable for everyone, so a\u00a0 blood test  should be carried out to check if you can use them. If they're not suitable, an alternative immunosuppressant medication called methotrexate may be used. \n Side effects of these immunosuppressants can include: \n \n nausea and vomiting \n increased vulnerability to infection \n pancreatitis \n feeling tired, breathless and weak, which is caused by\u00a0 anaemia  \n liver problems \n \n During the course of medication, you'll have regular blood tests to check for serious side effects. \n The immunosuppressants azathioprine and mercaptopurine are considered safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women can continue to\u00a0use these drugs when trying to start a family and during pregnancy. \n However, methotrexate must not be taken for at least 6\u00a0months before trying for a baby, as this drug is known to cause birth defects.\u00a0This applies to both men and women.\u00a0It must also be avoided\u00a0while you're breastfeeding. \n It's important to speak to your doctor if you're planning a pregnancy or if you become pregnant during your course of treatment for Crohn's disease. \n Severe Crohn's disease \n For people in\u00a0poor general health\u00a0with severe symptoms of Crohn's disease, medicines called biological therapies may be used\u00a0to reduce your symptoms if corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are unsuitable or ineffective. \n Biological therapies are a type of powerful immunosuppressant medication created using naturally occurring biological substances, such as antibodies and enzymes. \n The 2\u00a0medicines used to treat Crohn's disease in the UK are called infliximab and adalimumab. They work by targeting a protein called tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which is believed to be responsible for the inflammation associated with Crohn's disease. Infliximab can be used for children over 6\u00a0years old and adults,\u00a0but adalimumab should only be used\u00a0by adults. \n Infliximab is given as a drip into a vein in your arm (known as an infusion) in hospital. Adalimumab is given as an injection, and it may be possible for you, a family member or a friend to be taught how to give it, so you don't need to visit hospital for every treatment. \n Treatment usually lasts at least 12 months, unless these drugs\u00a0stop being effective sooner than this. After this time, your condition will be assessed to determine if further treatment is necessary. \n There's a risk of these medicines causing an allergic reaction,\u00a0which can cause symptoms such as: \n \n itchy skin \n a high temperature \n joint and muscle pain \n swelling of the hands or lips \n problems swallowing \n \n You should seek immediate medical assistance if you experience these symptoms. Reactions can occur immediately after treatment,\u00a0although they have been known to occur months\u00a0later, even after treatment stops. \n Surgery \n Surgery may be\u00a0recommended to reduce your symptoms if\u00a0your healthcare team feel the benefits outweigh the risks. \n In many cases, a type of surgery called a resection is used. This involves removing the inflamed area of the\u00a0intestine and stitching the healthy sections together. \n In some cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure called an  ileostomy \u00a0to\u00a0temporarily divert digestive waste away from the inflamed colon (large intestine) to give it a chance to heal. \n During this operation,\u00a0the end of the small intestine (the ileum) is disconnected from the colon\u00a0and re-routed through a hole made in the abdomen, which is known as a stoma. An external bag is attached to the opening to collect waste products. \n Once the colon has sufficiently recovered\u00a0\u2013 usually after several months\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a second operation will be needed to close the stoma and re-attach the small intestine to the colon. \n Maintaining remission \n Remission is a period when you don't have any symptoms or your symptoms are mild. During these periods, you can choose whether or not to\u00a0use medication to help maintain this. \n If you decide not to have further treatment, you\u00a0should be advised about attending regular follow-up appointments and which symptoms to look out for. These symptoms\u00a0include unintended weight loss, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. \n If you choose to have treatment, this will usually involve immunosuppressants. Corticosteroids aren't recommended for maintaining remission. \n Complications \n If you develop complications of Crohn's disease, such as\u00a0anal fistulas or intestinal narrowing (stricture), these will also need to be treated. Surgery is\u00a0necessary in most of these cases. \n See  complications of Crohn's disease \u00a0for more information. \n Diet and smoking \n Although there's no evidence to suggest diet plays a role in Crohn's disease, some people have found\u00a0certain foods aggravate their symptoms. It may be useful to keep a food diary to make a note of the foods you eat and to record the effects they have on your symptoms. \n If you notice\u00a0certain foods make your symptoms worse, avoiding these may reduce your symptoms. However, the total elimination of entire food types, such as grains or sugars, isn't usually recommended. \n Some people find that eating 6\u00a0smaller meals a day, rather than three larger meals, improves their symptoms. \n If you smoke, stopping can also reduce your symptoms and maintain remission. \n Read about  treatments to help you quit smoking .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "A number of different tests may be needed to diagnose Crohn's disease, as it has similar symptoms to several other conditions. \n Initial assessment \n During your initial assessment, your GP will usually ask you about the pattern of your symptoms and check whether there may be any contributing causes, such as: \n \n diet \n recent travel \u2013 for example, you may have developed travellers' diarrhoea while travelling abroad \n whether you're taking any medication, including any over-the-counter medicines \n whether you have a family history of Crohn's disease \n \n Your GP may also carry out a series of standard tests to assess your general state of health. For example, they may: \n \n check your pulse \n check your blood pressure \n measure your height and weight \n measure your temperature \n examine your abdomen (tummy) \n \n Blood tests \n Your GP may then arrange a series of\u00a0 blood tests . These can be used to assess: \n \n the levels of inflammation in your body \n whether you have an infection\u00a0 \n whether you're\u00a0 anaemic , which could suggest you're  malnourished  or losing blood from your bowel \n \n Stool sample \n You may be asked to provide a\u00a0stool sample, which\u00a0can be checked for blood and mucus. It can also be used to determine whether your symptoms are being caused by a parasitic infection such as\u00a0roundworm, or other infections. \n A\u00a0faecal calprotectin test may be offered to adults who have recently developed symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation and are being considered for specialist treatment. This test helps clinicians to distinguish between irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). \n After you've provided a stool and blood sample,\u00a0you'll probably be referred to a gastroenterologist (a specialist in conditions of the digestive system). They'll discuss the results with you and carry out\u00a0the tests described below if they're necessary. \n Colonoscopy \n A\u00a0colonoscopy is a test used to examine the inside of your colon. It involves inserting a long, flexible tube\u00a0called\u00a0an endoscope into your colon through your\u00a0back passage (rectum). \n The endoscope has a light and a camera on the end. The camera can be used to send images to a television screen. These show\u00a0the level and extent of inflammation inside your colon. \n The endoscope can also be fitted with surgical tools that can be used to take a number of small tissue samples from different sections of your digestive system. This is known as a  biopsy . The procedure may feel uncomfortable, but it's not painful. \n These tissue samples will be examined under a microscope for the cell changes known to occur in cases of Crohn's disease. \n Wireless capsule endoscopy \n A wireless capsule endoscopy is a new type of test that involves swallowing a small capsule (about the size of a large vitamin tablet). The capsule works its way down to your small intestines, where it transmits images to a recording device worn on a belt or in a small shoulder bag. \n A few days after the test, the capsule passes out of your body in\u00a0the stool. The capsule is disposable, so you don't have to worry about retrieving it from your stools. \n As this is a relatively new test, availability may be limited. In some cases, MRE or CTE scans\u00a0may be used instead of capsule endoscopy. \n MRE and CTE scans \n Scans called\u00a0 magnetic resonance \u00a0enterography/enteroclysis (MRE) or  computerised tomography \u00a0enterography/enteroclysis (CTE) may be used\u00a0to examine the small intestine in people with suspected Crohn's disease. \n Before having these scans, you'll either need to drink a harmless liquid called a contrast agent (enterography), or contrast agent may be placed through a tube in your nose that leads to your small intestine (enteroclysis). These contrast agents allow your small intestine to show up more clearly during the scans. \n During an MRE scan, magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of your small intestines. During CTE scans, several X-rays are taken and assembled by computer to create a detailed image. \n These tests are\u00a0increasingly used instead of\u00a0a small bowel enema or small bowel follow-through, because they\u00a0allow more detailed examination of the small intestine.\u00a0MRE scans also avoid any exposure to X-ray radiation. \n Small bowel enema or small bowel follow-through \n A small bowel\u00a0enema\u00a0(SBE) and small bowel follow-through (SBFT) are 2\u00a0similar tests that have traditionally been used to examine the whole of the inside of the small intestine, usually at the point where it meets the colon. They're sometimes used because only about the last 20cm of the small intestine is usually seen during colonoscopy. \n During an SBE/SBFT, a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  spray is used to numb the inside of your nose and throat. A tube is passed down your nose and into your throat before being threaded into your small intestine. This can feel unpleasant at first, but most people find they get used to the sensation after a few minutes. \n A harmless liquid called barium is passed down the tube. The barium coats the lining of your small intestines, so they show up clearly on X-ray. A series of X-ray images will then be taken. The images can often highlight the areas of narrowing and inflammation caused by Crohn's disease. \n After the test, you'll be advised to drink plenty of fluid to help wash the barium out of your body. You may notice that your stools look white for the first few days after having an SBE or SBFT. This is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about."},

For more persistent coughs, it's a good idea to see your GP so they can investigate the cause. \n What can cause a\u00a0cough? \n Some of the main causes of short-term (acute) and\u00a0persistent\u00a0(chronic) coughs are outlined below. \n Short-term coughs \n Common causes of a short-term cough include: \n \n an upper\u00a0respiratory tract infection\u00a0(URTI) that affects the throat, windpipe or sinuses\u00a0\u2013 examples are\u00a0a  cold ,\u00a0 flu ,  laryngitis ,  sinusitis  or  whooping cough  \n a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) that affects your lungs or lower airways\u00a0\u2013\u00a0examples are\u00a0acute  bronchitis \u00a0or  pneumonia  \n an  allergy , such as  allergic rhinitis \u00a0or  hay fever  \n a flare-up of a long-term condition such as  asthma ,\u00a0 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  or chronic  bronchitis  \n inhaled dust or smoke \u00a0 \n \n In rare cases, a short-term cough may be the first sign of a health condition that causes a\u00a0persistent cough. \n Persistent\u00a0coughs \n A persistent cough may be caused by: \n \n a\u00a0long-term\u00a0respiratory tract infection, such as\u00a0chronic bronchitis\u00a0\u00a0 \n asthma\u00a0\u2013 this also usually causes other symptoms, such as wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath \n an\u00a0 allergy  \n smoking\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a smoker's cough can also be a symptom of\u00a0COPD \n bronchiectasis\u00a0\u2013 where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened \n postnasal drip\u00a0\u2013 mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose, caused by a condition such as\u00a0rhinitis\u00a0or\u00a0sinusitis \n  gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where the throat becomes\u00a0irritated by leaking stomach acid \n a prescribed medicine, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor), which is used to treat\u00a0high blood pressure and\u00a0cardiovascular disease \n \n Rarely, a\u00a0persistent cough can be\u00a0a symptom of a more serious condition, such as  lung cancer ,  heart failure , a pulmonary\u00a0embolism\u00a0(blood clot on the lung) or\u00a0 tuberculosis .\u00a0 \n Coughs\u00a0in children \n Coughs\u00a0in children\u00a0often have similar causes to those mentioned above. For example, respiratory tract infections,\u00a0asthma and\u00a0GORD can all affect children. \n Causes of coughs that are more common in children than adults include: \n \n bronchiolitis\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0mild respiratory tract infection that usually causes cold-like symptoms \n croup\u00a0\u2013 this causes a distinctive barking cough and a harsh sound known as stridor when the child\u00a0breathes in \n  whooping cough \u00a0\u2013 look out for symptoms such as intense, hacking bouts of coughing, vomiting, and a\u00a0\"whoop\" sound with each sharp intake of breath after coughing \n \n Occasionally, a persistent cough in a child can be a\u00a0sign of a serious long-term condition, such as\u00a0 cystic fibrosis . \n When to see your GP \n There's usually no need to see your GP if you or your child\u00a0have a mild cough for a week or two. However, you should seek medical advice if: \n \n you've had a cough for more than three weeks \n your cough is particularly severe or is\u00a0getting worse \n you\u00a0cough up blood\u00a0or experience shortness of breath, breathing difficulties or chest pain \n you have any other worrying symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss, a persistent change in your voice,\u00a0or\u00a0lumps or swellings in your neck \n \n If your GP is unsure what's causing your cough, they may refer you to a hospital specialist for an assessment. They may also request some tests, such as\u00a0a chest\u00a0 X-ray , allergy tests, breathing tests, and an analysis of a sample of your phlegm to check for infection. \n What treatments are available? \n Treatment isn't always necessary for mild, short-term coughs because it's likely to be a viral infection that will get\u00a0better on its own within a few weeks. You can look after yourself at home by resting, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking painkillers such as\u00a0 paracetamol  or  ibuprofen . \n Cough medicines and remedies \n Although some people find them helpful,\u00a0medicines that claim to suppress your cough or stop you bringing up phlegm are not usually recommended. This is because\u00a0there's little evidence to suggest they're any more effective than simple home remedies, and they're not suitable for everyone. \n The\u00a0 Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  recommends that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines shouldn't be given to children under the age of six. Children aged 6 to 12 should only use them on the advice of a doctor or pharmacist. \n A\u00a0homemade remedy containing honey and lemon is likely to be just as useful and safer to take. Honey shouldn't be given to babies under the age of one because of the risk of infant botulism. \n Treating the underlying cause \n If your cough has a specific cause, treating this may help. For example: \n \n asthma\u00a0can be treated\u00a0with\u00a0inhaled\u00a0steroids\u00a0to reduce inflammation in\u00a0your airways \n allergies can be treated by avoiding things you're allergic to and taking\u00a0antihistamines\u00a0to dampen down your allergic reactions \n bacterial infections can be treated with  antibiotics  \n GORD can be treated with\u00a0antacids\u00a0to neutralise your stomach acid and medication to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces \n COPD can be treated with\u00a0bronchodilators to widen your airways \n \n If you smoke, quitting\u00a0is also likely to help improve your cough.

It can mean that you're not passing stools regularly or you're unable to completely empty your bowel. \n Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as\u00a0unusually large or small. \n The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life. \n Read more about the  symptoms of constipation . \n What causes constipation? \n It's often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation.\u00a0However, there are a number of things that\u00a0contribute to the condition, including: \n \n not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals \n a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits \n ignoring the urge to pass stools \n side effects of certain medications \n not drinking enough fluids \n  anxiety \u00a0or\u00a0 depression  \n \n In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems\u00a0 toilet training  can all\u00a0lead\u00a0to constipation. \n Read more about the  causes of constipation . \n Who's affected \n Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It's estimated that around 1\u00a0in every 7\u00a0adults and up to 1\u00a0in every 3\u00a0children in the UK has constipation at any one time. \n The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy. \n When to see your GP \n You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don't help and the problem continues, you should see your GP. \n Also speak to your GP if you think your child might be constipated. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing constipation . \n Treating constipation \n Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation. \n This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise. \n If these aren't effective, your GP may prescribe an oral\u00a0laxative medication\u00a0that can\u00a0help you empty your bowels. \n Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established. \n Read more about  treating constipation . \n Preventing constipation \n Making the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also\u00a0help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place. \n Giving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to\u00a0ignore the urge to go to the toilet. \n Read more about  preventing constipation . \n Complications \n For most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with\u00a0long-term constipation can develop: \n \n  haemorrhoids (piles)  \n faecal impaction (where dry, hard stools collect in the rectum) \n  bowel incontinence (the leakage of liquid stools)  \n \n Read more about the\u00a0 complications of constipation .", "symptoms": "When you're constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual. \n Normal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0days. Similarly, some infants pass stools several times a day, while others only pass them a few times a week. \n If you or your child pass stools less than usual, it could be a sign of constipation. \n It may also be more difficult to pass stools and you may feel unable to empty your bowel\u00a0completely. Your stools may appear dry, hard and lumpy, as well as abnormally large or small. \n Other symptoms of constipation can include: \n \n  stomach ache and cramps \u00a0 \n feeling bloated \n feeling\u00a0sick \n loss of appetite \n \n Constipation in children \n As well as infrequent or irregular bowel movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms: \n \n loss of appetite \n a lack of energy \n being irritable, angry or unhappy \n foul-smelling wind and stools \n stomach\u00a0pain and discomfort \n soiling their clothes \n generally feeling unwell \n \n When to see your GP \n You may be able to\u00a0 treat constipation yourself  by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle. However, you should see your GP if these changes don't help. \n You should also see your GP for advice if you notice any rectal bleeding,\u00a0unexplained weight loss or persistent tiredness. \n Take your child to see your GP if you think they are constipated.  Laxatives  are often recommended for children alongside diet and lifestyle changes.", "causes": "Constipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry. \n Most cases of constipation aren't caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. However, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including: \n \n not eating enough fibre, such as fruit, vegetables and cereals \n a change in your routine or lifestyle, such as a change in your eating habits \n having limited privacy when using the toilet \n ignoring the urge to pass stools \n immobility or lack of exercise \n not drinking enough fluids \n having a high temperature (fever) \n being underweight or overweight \n  anxiety \u00a0or\u00a0 depression  \n psychiatric problems, such as those brought on by sexual abuse, violence or trauma \n \n Medication \n Constipation may sometimes be a side effect of a medicine you're taking. Common types of medication that can cause constipation include: \n \n aluminium\u00a0antacids (medicine to treat  indigestion ) \n  antidepressants \u00a0 \n antiepileptics (medicine to treat  epilepsy ) \n antipsychotics (medicine to treat\u00a0 schizophrenia  and other mental health conditions) \n calcium\u00a0supplements \n opiate painkillers, such as codeine and morphine \n diuretics (water tablets) \n  iron\u00a0supplements  \n \n If constipation is caused by medication, the condition will usually ease once you stop taking the medicine. However, you shouldn't stop taking any prescribed medication unless your GP advises you to. \n Speak to your GP if you have constipation that's caused by\u00a0a medicine. They may be able to prescribe an alternative. \n Pregnancy \n About 2\u00a0in every 5\u00a0women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages. \n Constipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant. \n The bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. This is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. An increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along. \n If you're pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Read more about  treating constipation . \n Other conditions \n In rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as: \n \n  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  \n  diabetes  \n hypercalcaemia \u2013 where there's too much calcium in the bloodstream \n  underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)  \n muscular dystrophy\u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that causes muscle wasting \n  multiple sclerosis \u00a0\u2013 a condition that affects the nervous system \n  Parkinson's disease \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where part of the brain becomes progressively damaged, affecting the co-ordination of body movements \n spinal cord injury \n anal fissure\u00a0\u2013 a small tear or ulcer\u00a0in the skin\u00a0just inside the anus \n inflammatory bowel disease\u00a0\u2013 a condition that causes the intestines to become inflamed (irritated and swollen) \n  bowel cancer  \n \n Babies and children \n Constipation in babies and children is quite common. It's estimated that up to 1\u00a0in every 3\u00a0children in the UK has constipation at any time. Poor diet, fear about using the toilet and poor\u00a0 toilet training  can all be responsible. \n Poor diet \n Children who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don't get enough fluids. Babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. As with adults, it's very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet. \n Toilet training \n It's important that you don't make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. It's also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). Constantly intervening when they're using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation. \n Toilet habits \n Some children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. They may have a  phobia  about using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school. \n This fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. This can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. However, if they do this, their condition will only get worse. \n Other conditions \n In rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as: \n \n Hirschsprung's disease \u2013 which affects the bowel, making it difficult to pass stools \n anorectal malformation \u2013 where the baby's anus and rectum don't form properly \n spinal cord abnormalities \u2013 including rare conditions such as spina bifida and cerebral palsy \n  cystic fibrosis  \u2013 a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick and sticky mucus, which can lead to constipation", "treatment": "Treatment for constipation depends on the cause, how long you've had it and how severe your symptoms are. \n In many cases, it's possible to relieve the symptoms by making dietary and lifestyle changes. \n The various treatments for\u00a0constipation\u00a0are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Lifestyle advice \n Changes to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. In many cases,\u00a0this will improve the condition\u00a0without the need for medication. \n Some self-help methods of treating constipation are listed below: \n \n Increase your daily intake of fibre. You should eat at least 18-30g of fibre a day. High-fibre foods include plenty of fresh\u00a0 fruit and vegetables  and cereals. \n Add some bulking agents, such as wheat bran, to your diet. This will help to make your stools softer and easier to pass. \n Avoid\u00a0 dehydration  by drinking plenty of water. \n Exercise more regularly\u00a0\u2013 for example,\u00a0by going for a daily\u00a0 walk  or  run . \n If constipation is causing pain or discomfort, you may want to take a painkiller, such as  paracetamol . Always follow the dosage instructions carefully. Children under 16 shouldn't take  aspirin . \n Keep to a routine (a place and time of day) when you're able to spend time on the toilet. Respond to your bowel's natural pattern: when you feel the urge, don't delay. \n Try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so that your knees are above your hips; this can make passing stools easier.\u00a0 \n If medication you're taking\u00a0could be causing constipation, your GP may be able to prescribe an alternative. \n \n Read about\u00a0 preventing constipation  for more ways to change your diet and lifestyle. \n Your GP may prescribe an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don't help. \n Laxatives \n  Laxatives \u00a0are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. There are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system. \n Bulk-forming laxatives \n Your GP will usually start\u00a0you on\u00a0a bulk-forming laxative. These work by helping your stools to retain fluid. This means they're less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass. \n Commonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk,\u00a0methylcellulose and sterculia. When taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don't take them before going to bed. It will usually be 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative. \n Osmotic laxatives \n If your stools remain hard after you've taken a bulk-forming laxative, your GP may prescribe an osmotic laxative instead. Osmotic laxatives increase the amount of fluid in your bowels. This\u00a0softens your stools and stimulates your body to pass them. \n Commonly prescribed osmotic laxatives include\u00a0lactulose and macrogols. As with bulk-forming laxatives, make sure you drink enough fluids. It will usually be 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days before you feel the effect of the laxative. \n Stimulant laxatives \n If your stools are soft, but you still have difficulty passing them, your GP may prescribe a stimulant laxative. This type of laxative stimulates the muscles that line your digestive tract, helping them to move stools and waste products along your large intestine to your anus. \n The most commonly prescribed stimulant laxatives are senna, bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate. These laxatives are usually only used on a short-term basis, and they start to work within 6 to 12 hours. \n According to your individual preference and\u00a0how quickly\u00a0you need\u00a0relief, your GP may decide to combine different laxatives. \n How long will I need to take laxatives for? \n If you've had constipation for a short time, your GP will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed. \n However, if your constipation\u00a0is caused by\u00a0an underlying medical condition or a medicine you're taking,\u00a0you may have to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or\u00a0even years. \n If you've been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. If you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you'll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. This can take several months. \n Your GP will advise you about when it's best to stop taking laxatives.\u00a0 \n Treating faecal impaction \n Faecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. This obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along. \n Sometimes as a result of impaction, overflow\u00a0 diarrhoea  may occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). You may have difficulty controlling this. \n If you have faecal impaction, you'll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. After a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative. \n If you don't respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the medications described below. \n \n Suppository \u2013 this type of medicine is inserted into your anus. The suppository gradually dissolves at body temperature and is then absorbed into your bloodstream. Bisacodyl is an example of a medication that can be given in suppository form. \n Mini enema \u2013 where a medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus and into your large bowel. Docusate and sodium citrate can be given in this way. \n \n Pregnancy or breastfeeding \n If you're pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Your GP will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. You'll also be advised to do gentle exercise. \n If dietary and lifestyle changes don't work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly. \n Lots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren't absorbed by the digestive system. This means that your baby won't feel the effects of the laxative. \n Laxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. If these don't work, your GP may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives). \n However, senna may not be suitable if you're in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it's partially absorbed by your digestive system. \n Read more about  constipation and other common pregnancy problems . \n Babies\u00a0who haven't been weaned \n If your baby is constipated but hasn't started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. If you're using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don't dilute the mixture. \n You may want to try gently moving your baby's legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels. \n Babies who are eating solids \n If your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. Try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be pur\u00e9ed or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. The best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are: \n \n apples \n apricots \n grapes \n peaches \n pears \n plums \n prunes \n raspberries \n strawberries \n \n Never force your baby to eat food if they don't want to. If you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience. \n If your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. Bulk-forming laxatives aren't suitable for babies, so they'll usually be given an osmotic laxative. However, if this doesn't work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative. \n Children \n For\u00a0children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. Osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary. \n As well as eating fruit, older children should have a  healthy, balanced diet , which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta. \n Try to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or\u00a0using the toilet. It's important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. Allow your child\u00a0at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they've passed as many stools as possible. \n To encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child's bowel movements linked to a reward system. This can help them focus on using the toilet successfully.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Constipation is a very common condition. Your GP won't usually need to carry out any tests or procedures, but will confirm a diagnosis based on your symptoms and medical history. \n Your GP will ask you some questions about your bowel habits. Don't feel embarrassed about discussing this with your GP. It's important they're aware of all of your symptoms, so they can make the correct diagnosis. \n Your GP may also ask questions about your diet, level of exercise and whether there have been any recent changes to your routines. \n Doctors define constipation in a number of ways: \n \n opening the bowels less than 3\u00a0times a week \n needing to strain to open your bowels on more than a quarter of occasions \n passing a hard or pellet-like stool on more than a quarter of occasions \n \n Physical examination \n If your GP thinks you may have faecal impaction (when dry, hard stools collect in your rectum), they may carry out a physical examination. See  complications of constipation  for more information about faecal impaction. \n A typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the GP feels your abdomen (tummy). You'll then lie on your side while your GP carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. Your GP will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected. \n An internal physical examination rarely needs to be carried out on a child. Instead, the diagnosis can usually be made by feeling the child's tummy. \n Further tests \n If you're experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor may request further tests, such as  blood tests  or thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions. \n Other tests you may have include: \n \n an abdominal  X-ray  \u2013 where X-ray\u00a0radiation is used to produce images of the inside of your abdomen \n transit study examination \u2013 where you take a short course of special capsules that show up on X-rays; one or more X-rays are taken later on to see how long it takes for the capsules to pass through your digestive system \n anorectal manometry \u2013 where a small device with a balloon at one end is inserted into your rectum and\u00a0attached to a machine that measures pressure readings from the balloon as you squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles; this gives an idea of how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working \n \n As there's an increased risk of  bowel cancer  in older adults, your doctor may also request tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  or colonoscopy."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Conjunctivitis", "introduction": "Conjunctivitis is a common condition that causes redness and inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye (the conjunctiva). \n People often refer to conjunctivitis as red eye. \n Other symptoms of conjunctivitis include itchiness and watering of the eyes, and sometimes a sticky coating on the eyelashes (if\u00a0it's caused by an\u00a0allergy). \n Read more about the  symptoms of conjunctivitis  \n Conjunctivitis can affect one eye at first, but usually affects both eyes after a few hours. \n What causes conjunctivitis? \n The conjunctiva can become inflamed as a result of: \n \n a bacterial or viral infection \u2013 this is known as infective conjunctivitis \n an allergic reaction to a substance such as pollen or dust mites \u2013 this is known as allergic conjunctivitis \n the eye coming into contact with things that can irritate the conjunctiva, such as\u00a0shampoo or chlorinated water, or a loose eyelash rubbing against the eye \u2013 this is known as irritant conjunctivitis \n \n Read more about the  causes of conjunctivitis  \n Treating conjunctivitis \n Treatment isn't usually needed for conjunctivitis, because the symptoms often clear up within a couple of weeks. If treatment is needed, the type of treatment will depend on the cause. In severe cases, antibiotic eye drops can be used to clear the infection. \n Irritant conjunctivitis will clear up as soon as whatever is causing it is removed. \n Allergic conjunctivitis can usually be treated with anti-allergy medications such as antihistamines. If possible, you should avoid the substance that triggered the allergy. \n It's best not to wear contact lenses until the symptoms have cleared up. Any sticky or crusty coating on the eyelids or lashes can be cleansed with cotton wool and water. \n Washing your hands regularly and not sharing pillows or towels will help prevent it spreading. \n Read more about  treating conjunctivitis  \n See your GP immediately if you have: \n \n eye pain \n sensitivity to light (photophobia) \n disturbed vision \n intense redness in one eye or both eyes \n a newborn baby with conjunctivitis\u00a0 \n \n Work and school \n Public Health England (PHE) advises that you don't need to stay away from work or school if you or your child has conjunctivitis, unless you (or they) are\u00a0feeling particularly unwell. \n If there are a number of conjunctivitis cases at your child's school or nursery, you may be advised to keep them away until their infection has cleared up. \n Generally, adults who work in close contact with others, or share equipment such as phones and computers, shouldn't return to work until the discharge has cleared up. \n Complications \n Conjunctivitis can be a frustrating condition\u00a0\u2013 particularly allergic conjunctivitis\u00a0\u2013 but in most cases it doesn't pose a serious threat to health. \n Complications of conjunctivitis are rare, but when they do occur they can be serious and include: \n \n a severe case of allergic conjunctivitis can lead to scarring in the eye \n in cases of infective conjunctivitis, the infection can spread to other areas of the body, triggering more serious secondary infections, such as  meningitis  \n \n Read more about the  complications of conjunctivitis", "symptoms": "The symptoms of conjunctivitis will depend on what's causing the condition. \n However,\u00a0the two main symptoms are usually: \n \n eye redness \u2013 as a result of the inflammation and widening of the tiny blood vessels in the conjunctiva (the thin layer of cells covering the front of the eyes) \n a discharge \u2013 the conjunctiva contains thousands of cells that produce mucus and tiny glands that produce tears\u00a0\u2013\u00a0inflammation causes the glands to become overactive, so that they produce more water and mucus \n \n Only one eye\u00a0tends to be\u00a0affected at first,\u00a0but symptoms usually\u00a0affect both eyes\u00a0within a few hours. \n Infective conjunctivitis \n If you have infective conjunctivitis, you may also have: \n \n a burning sensation in your eyes \n a feeling of grit in\u00a0your eyes \n a sticky coating on the eyelashes\u00a0\u2013 usually when you first wake up in the morning \n an enlarged lymph node (gland) in front of the ear \n \n Allergic conjunctivitis \n You may have itchy eyes\u00a0if you have allergic conjunctivitis.\u00a0\u00a0 \n The pattern of symptoms for allergic conjunctivitis depends on the substance you're allergic to. \n  Allergies \u00a0to\u00a0pollen ( hay fever ) occur during certain parts of the year. You can have an allergy to: \n \n tree pollen, released during spring \n grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer \n weed pollen, released any time from early spring to late autumn \n \n It's highly likely that the pollen will also cause other symptoms, such as sneezing and\u00a0a runny or blocked nose. \n Allergies to dust mites or animal fur cause symptoms throughout the year. Both eyes are usually affected and you may find the symptoms worse in the morning. \n Some people develop an allergy to eye drops. This is known as contact dermatoconjunctivitis and it can also affect your eyelids, causing them to become dry and sore. \n Some people are allergic to wearing contact lenses, which is known as giant papillary conjunctivitis. The symptoms progress much more slowly and you may also develop small spots on the inside of your upper eyelids.\u00a0This type of conjunctivitis carries a high risk of complications, so you need to seek medical advice as soon as possible \n When to seek medical advice \n Most cases of conjunctivitis aren't a cause for concern, but you should contact your GP if you think you have it, particularly if you think it's related to wearing contact lenses. \n Your GP can check whether there's a more serious underlying cause of your symptoms. \n When to seek immediate medical advice \n The following symptoms could be the sign of a more serious eye condition: \n \n pain in your eyes \n sensitivity to light (photophobia) \n disturbed vision \n intense redness in one eye or both eyes \n \n Contact your GP immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. If this isn't possible, visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department.", "causes": "Conjunctivitis is a condition that occurs when the conjunctiva (a thin layer of cells covering the front of your eyes) becomes inflamed. \n The three most common causes of this inflammation are: \n \n infection (infective conjunctivitis) \n an allergic reaction (allergic conjunctivitis) \n something irritating the conjunctiva, such as a loose eyelash (irritant conjunctivitis) \n \n These are\u00a0discussed in more detail below. \n Infective conjunctivitis \n Eye infections are most commonly caused by: \n \n bacteria\u00a0\u2013 for example, the strains of bacteria that\u00a0often cause lung and ear infections \n a virus\u00a0\u2013 most commonly an adenovirus that may also cause a  sore throat  and high temperature (fever) \n  sexually transmitted infections (STIs) \u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0chlamydia or gonorrhoea \n \n Viral conjunctivitis causes a watery discharge, while the discharge from bacterial conjunctivitis contains pus. An eye swab\u00a0can also determine the cause of the infection (read more about  diagnosing conjunctivitis ). \n Spreading the infection \n You're more likely to develop infective conjunctivitis if you've been in close contact with someone who's already infected with it. \n It's therefore very important to wash your hands thoroughly after coming into contact with anyone who has infective conjunctivitis. You should also avoid sharing pillows or towels with anyone with the infection. \n Risk groups \n You may be more at risk of getting infective conjunctivitis if: \n \n you're old or young \u2013 it's more common in children and the elderly, possibly because children come into contact with more infections at school, and elderly people may have a weaker immune system \n you've recently had an upper respiratory tract infection \u2013 such as a  cold  \n you have  diabetes  or another condition that weakens your immune system \u2013 as you may be more vulnerable to infections \n you're taking  corticosteroids (steroids) \u00a0\u2013 which can weaken your immune system \n you have blepharitis (inflammation of the rims of the eyelids)\u00a0\u2013 which can be caused by a bacterial infection and may lead to conjunctivitis \n you've been in a crowded place \u2013 such as a busy train \n \n Allergic conjunctivitis \n Allergic conjunctivitis is caused when your eyes come into contact with an allergen (a particular substance that causes your immune system to react abnormally). This is known as an allergic reaction. \n There are four main types of allergic conjunctivitis: \n \n seasonal allergic conjunctivitis \n perennial allergic conjunctivitis \n contact dermatoconjunctivitis \n giant papillary conjunctivitis \n \n Seasonal and perennial conjunctivitis \n Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are usually caused by: \n \n pollen from grass, trees or flowers \n dust mites \n flakes of dead animal skin \n \n These types of conjunctivitis are more common in people who also have other allergies, such as\u00a0 asthma ,\u00a0and often occur with\u00a0allergic rhinitis. \n Contact dermatoconjunctivitis \n Contact dermatoconjunctivitis is\u00a0usually caused by eye drops, but it can also be caused by make-up or chemicals. \n Giant papillary conjunctivitis \n Giant papillary conjunctivitis is caused by: \n \n contact lenses \n stitches used in eye surgery \n a prostheses (artificial) part of the eye that's fitted during eye surgery \n \n Giant papillary conjunctivitis is estimated to affect around 1-5% of people who use soft contact lenses and 1% of people who use hard contact lenses. \n Irritant conjunctivitis \n Irritant conjunctivitis can have a wide range of potential causes. Some common causes include: \n \n chlorinated water used in swimming pools\u00a0 \n shampoo \n a stray eyelash rubbing against the conjunctiva \n smoke or fumes", "treatment": "The recommended treatment for conjunctivitis will depend on whether it's caused by infection, an allergic reaction or an irritant, such as a stray eyelash. \n Each treatment option is discussed in more detail below. \n Infective conjunctivitis \n Most cases of infective conjunctivitis don't need medical treatment and clear up in one to two weeks. \n Self care \n There are several ways you can treat infective conjunctivitis at home. The advice below\u00a0should help ease your symptoms. \n \n Remove your contact lenses\u00a0\u2013 if you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the symptoms of the infection have gone; don't re-use old lenses after the infection has gone because they could be a potential source of re-infection; always use new lenses, solutions and cases after an infection. \n Use lubricant eye drops \u2013 these are available over the counter at pharmacies or they may be prescribed for you; they may help ease any soreness and stickiness in your eyes; always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n Gently clean away sticky discharge from your eyelids and lashes using cotton wool soaked in water. \n Wash your hands regularly \u2013 this is particularly important after touching your eyes and will stop the infection spreading to others. \n \n Antibiotics \n  Antibiotics \u00a0aren't usually prescribed for infective conjunctivitis because it usually clears up by itself and there's a very low risk of complications for untreated conjunctivitis. \n However, if the infection is particularly severe or it has lasted for more than two weeks, you may be prescribed antibiotics. Some schools or playgroups may insist that a child is treated with antibiotics before they can return, although this is rare. \n Chloramphenicol and\u00a0fusidic acid are the two main types of antibiotics that may be prescribed. \n Chloramphenicol \n Chloramphenicol is usually the first choice of antibiotic and comes in the form of eye drops. It's available without a prescription from pharmacies to treat bacterial conjunctivitis. \n Chloramphenicol needs to be used carefully to get the best results, so make sure you follow the advice of your pharmacist about how and when to use it, or check the patient information leaflet that comes with the medication so you know how to use it properly. \n If eye drops aren't suitable for you, you may be prescribed the antibiotic as an eye ointment instead. \n Fusidic acid \n Fusidic acid\u00a0may be prescribed if chloramphenicol isn't suitable for you. It's often better for children and elderly people because it doesn't need to be used as often. It's also the preferred treatment for pregnant women. \n Like\u00a0chloramphenicol, fusidic acid comes in the form of eye drops and should be used as advised by your doctor or as described in the instructions that come with the medication. \n Side effects \n Eye drops can briefly cause\u00a0blurred\u00a0vision. Avoid driving or operating machinery straight after using eye drops. \n Chloramphenicol and fusidic acid can also cause other side effects, such as a slight stinging or burning sensation in your eye, although this shouldn't last long. \n Further treatment \n It's very important to go back\u00a0to your GP if you still have symptoms after two weeks. You should also contact your GP immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: \n \n eye pain \n sensitivity to light (photophobia) \n loss of vision \n intense redness in one eye or both eyes \n \n Your GP may recommend that you're tested for  sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . Some STIs, such as chlamydia, can cause infective conjunctivitis. If this is the case, your symptoms may last for several months. \n Allergic conjunctivitis \n Your treatment will depend on the type of allergic conjunctivitis you have. \n The four main types of allergic conjunctivitis are: \n \n seasonal conjunctivitis \u2013 typically caused by an allergy to pollen \n perennial conjunctivitis \u2013 usually caused by an allergy to dust mites or pets \n contact dermatoconjunctivitis \u2013 usually caused by an allergy to eye drops or cosmetics \n giant papillary conjunctivitis \u2013 usually caused by an allergy to contact lenses \n \n Whatever the cause, you'll find that some self-help methods can ease your symptoms. \n Self care \n If you have allergic conjunctivitis, you can follow the guidelines below to treat your condition at home. \n \n If you wear contact lenses, take them out until all the signs and symptoms of the conjunctivitis have gone. \n Don't rub your eyes, even though they may be itchy. Rubbing your eyes can make your symptoms worse. \n Place a cool compress over your eyes.\u00a0Wetting a flannel with cool water and holding it over your eyes will help ease your symptoms. \n Avoid exposure to the allergen, if possible. \n \n Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis \n If you have seasonal or perennial conjunctivitis, you may be prescribed the following medicines: \n \n antihistamines\u00a0 \n mast cell stabilisers \n  corticosteroids \u00a0 \n \n These are described in more detail below. \n Antihistamines \n If allergic conjunctivitis needs rapid relief, your GP will probably prescribe a medicine known as an antihistamine. \n Antihistamines work by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it's under attack from an allergen. This prevents the symptoms of the allergic reaction occurring. \n Antihistamine eye drops \n You may be prescribed antihistamine eye drops, such as: \n \n azelastine\u00a0(not suitable for children under four years of age) \n emedastine\u00a0(not suitable for children under three years of age) \n ketotifen\u00a0(not suitable for children under three years of age) \n antazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin, not suitable for children under 12 years of age) \n \n Antazoline with xylometazoline (Otrivine-Antistin) is also available over the counter from pharmacies without prescription. Always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, some antihistamine eye drops may not be suitable.\u00a0Speak to your GP for advice. \u00a0 \n Oral antihistamines \n You may be prescribed an antihistamine such as: \n \n cetirizine \n fexofenadine \n loratadine \n \n You'll usually only have to take an antihistamine once a day. \n If possible, oral antihistamines shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Speak to your GP for advice. \n Although new antihistamines shouldn't make you drowsy, they may still have a sedating effect. This is\u00a0more likely if you take high doses or drink alcohol while you're taking antihistamines. \n Mast cell stabilisers \n Mast cell stabilisers are an alternative type of medicine. Unlike antihistamines, they won't provide rapid symptom relief, but they are better at controlling your symptoms over a longer period of time. \n It may take several weeks to feel the effects of a mast cell stabiliser, so you may also be prescribed an antihistamine to take at the same time. \n Mast cell stabilisers that are commonly prescribed in the form of eye drops include: \n \n lodoxamide \n nedocromil sodium \n sodium cromoglicate \n \n Corticosteroids \n If your symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are particularly severe, you may be prescribed a short course of\u00a0topical corticosteroids (a cream, gel or ointment). However, these aren't usually prescribed unless absolutely necessary. \n Giant papillary conjunctivitis \n As giant papillary conjunctivitis is usually caused by contact lenses, the symptoms often clear up after you stop wearing them. The spots that form on the inside of your upper eyelid may last slightly longer. \n If you develop giant papillary conjunctivitis as a result of recent eye surgery, you'll be immediately referred to an ophthalmologist. This is so that your eyes can be carefully monitored and the most effective treatment given. \n Irritant conjunctivitis \n Most cases of irritant conjunctivitis don't need any treatment, as the condition should clear up once the irritant is removed from the eye. \n An exception to this is if your eyes were exposed to harmful substances such as bleach or acid. This is usually regarded as a medical emergency and you'll need to be admitted to hospital so your eyes can be washed out with saline solution.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP should be able to diagnose conjunctivitis by asking about your symptoms and examining your eyes. \n Describing how your conjunctivitis started can help your GP diagnose which type it is and decide whether it needs to be treated. \n The most common symptoms of infective conjunctivitis are sticky, red and watery eyes. However, infective conjunctivitis can sometimes be confused with other types of conjunctivitis, which are treated differently. \n Swab test \n Your GP may suggest further tests, such as a swab test, if your conjunctivitis hasn't responded to treatment, or to help decide what treatment to use. \u00a0 \n A swab looks similar to a cotton bud. It's used to collect a small sample of mucus from your infected eye, which is sent to\u00a0a laboratory to find out the cause of your conjunctivitis. \n If your symptoms are severe or don't respond to treatment, you may need to see an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). \n Other conditions \n Most cases of\u00a0conjunctivitis clear up within\u00a0one to\u00a0two\u00a0weeks without needing any medical treatment. In some cases, it can last for longer than two weeks, which is known as persistent infective conjunctivitis. \n If you have any unusual symptoms, such as severe pain, blurred vision or sensitivity to light, it may mean that you have a more serious condition. \n If you have any of these symptoms, it's very important to seek medical assistance immediately, either by contacting your GP or going to your nearest hospital. \n Other more serious\u00a0conditions include: \n \n acute glaucoma \u2013\u00a0a rare form of glaucoma that causes a painful build-up of pressure in your eye \n keratitis \u2013 where the cornea (the clear layer at the front of your eye) becomes swollen and develops open sores \n iritis \u2013\u00a0a type of\u00a0uveitis (swelling of the middle layer of your eye) that causes pain,\u00a0 headaches  and\u00a0watery eyes \n \n Newborn babies \n Contact your GP straight away if you think your baby may have infective conjunctivitis (also called neonatal conjunctivitis). \n If this isn't possible, call\u00a0NHS 24's ' 111 ' service\u00a0or your local out-of-hours service. Your GP will examine your baby closely to see if they have sticky eyes or infective conjunctivitis. \n All newborn babies with infective conjunctivitis must be referred to an eye specialist straight away for treatment. \n Read more about the  symptoms of infective conjunctivitis"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Costochondritis", "introduction": "Costochondritis is the medical term for inflammation of the cartilage that joins your ribs to your breastbone (sternum). This area is known as the costochondral joint. \n Cartilage is tough but flexible connective tissue found throughout the body, including in the joints between bones. It acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the joints. \n Costochondritis\u00a0may improve on its own after a few weeks, although\u00a0it can\u00a0last for several months or more. The condition doesn't lead to any permanent problems, but may sometimes relapse. \n Tietze's syndrome \n Costochondritis\u00a0may be confused with a separate condition called Tietze's syndrome. Both conditions\u00a0involve\u00a0inflammation of the costochondral joint and can cause very similar symptoms. \n However, Tietze's syndrome is much less common and\u00a0often causes chest swelling, which may last after any pain and tenderness has gone. \n Costochondritis\u00a0also tends to affect adults aged 40 or over, whereas Tietze's syndrome usually affects young adults under 40. \n As the conditions are very similar, most of the information below\u00a0also applies to Tietze's syndrome. \n Signs and symptoms \n When the costochondral joint becomes inflamed it can result in sharp chest pain and tenderness, which may develop gradually or start suddenly. \n The pain may be made worse by: \n \n a particular posture\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as lying down \n pressure on\u00a0your chest\u00a0\u2013 such as wearing a seatbelt or hugging someone \n deep breathing, coughing and sneezing \n physical activity \n \n When to seek medical help \n It can be difficult to tell the difference between the\u00a0chest pain associated with costochondritis and pain caused by more serious conditions, such as\u00a0a  heart attack . \n However, a heart attack usually causes more widespread pain and additional symptoms, such as\u00a0 breathlessness , nausea and sweating. \n If you, or someone you're with, experiences sudden chest pain and you think there's a possibility it could be\u00a0a heart attack, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. \n If\u00a0you've\u00a0had chest pain\u00a0for a while, don't ignore it. Make an appointment to see your GP so they can investigate the cause. \n Causes of costochondritis \n Inflammation is the body's natural response to infection, irritation or injury. \n It's not known exactly\u00a0why the costochondral joint becomes inflamed, but in some cases it's been linked to: \n \n severe  coughing \u00a0\u2013 which\u00a0strains your chest area \n an injury to your chest \n physical strain from repeated exercise or sudden exertion that you're not\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as moving furniture \n an infection\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including\u00a0respiratory tract infections (RTIs)\u00a0and wound infections \n wear and tear\u00a0\u2013\u00a0your chest moves in and out 20 to 30 times a minute, and over time this motion can lead to discomfort in these joints \n \n Diagnosing costochondritis \n If you have symptoms of\u00a0costochondritis, your GP will examine and touch the upper chest area around your costochondral joint. They'll ask you when and where your pain occurs and look at your recent medical history. \n Before a diagnosis can be confirmed, some tests may need to be carried out to rule out other possible causes of your chest pain. \n These may include: \n \n an\u00a0 electrocardiogram (ECG) \u00a0\u2013 which records the rhythms and electrical activity of your heart \n a\u00a0blood test to check for signs of underlying inflammation \n a chest\u00a0 X-ray  \n \n If no other condition is suspected or found, a diagnosis of costrochondritis may be made. \n Treating costochondritis \n Costochondritis\u00a0often gets better after a few weeks, but self-help measures and medication can manage the symptoms. \n Self-help \n Costochondritis can be aggravated by any activity that places stress on your chest area, such as strenuous exercise or even simple movements like reaching up to a high cupboard. \n Any activity that makes the pain in your chest area worse should be avoided until the inflammation in your ribs and cartilage has improved. \n You may also find it\u00a0soothing to regularly apply heat to the painful area\u00a0\u2013 for example, using a cloth or flannel that's been warmed with hot water. \n Painkillers \n Painkillers, such as  paracetamol ,\u00a0can be used to ease mild to moderate pain. \n Taking\u00a0a type of medication called a\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) \u00a0\u2013 such as  ibuprofen \u00a0and naproxen\u00a0\u2013 two or three times a day can also help control the pain and swelling.\u00a0 \n Aspirin is also a suitable alternative,\u00a0but shouldn't be given to children under 16 years old. \n These medications are available from pharmacies without a prescription, but you should make sure you carefully read the instructions that come with them before use. \n NSAIDs aren't suitable for people with certain health conditions, including: \n \n  asthma  \n  stomach ulcers  \n  high blood pressure  \n kidney or heart problems \n \n Contact your GP if your symptoms get worse despite resting and taking painkillers, as you may benefit from treatment with corticosteroids.\u00a0 \n Corticosteroid injections \n  Corticosteroids \u00a0are powerful medicines that can help reduce pain and swelling. They\u00a0can be injected into and around your costochondral joint to help relieve the symptoms of costochondritis. \n Corticosteroid injections may be recommended if your pain is severe, or if NSAIDs are unsuitable or ineffective. \n They may be given by your GP, or you may need to be referred to a specialist called a rheumatologist. \n Having too many corticosteroid injections can damage your costochondral joint, so you may only be able to have this type of treatment once every few months if you continue to experience pain. \n Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) \n TENS is a method of pain relief where a mild electric current is delivered to the affected area using a small, battery-operated device.\u00a0 \n The electrical impulses can reduce the pain signals going to the spinal cord and brain, which may help relieve pain and relax muscles. \n They may also stimulate the production of endorphins, which are the body's natural painkillers. \n Although TENS may be used to help relieve pain in a wide range of conditions, it doesn't work for everyone. \n There isn't enough good-quality scientific evidence to say for sure whether TENS is a reliable method of pain relief. Speak to your GP if you're considering TENS. \n Read more about\u00a0transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Congenital heart disease", "introduction": "Congenital heart disease is a general term used to refer to a series of birth defects that affect the heart. \n Types of congenital heart disease \n There are over 30 different types of heart defect. \n The two main types of congenital heart disease are: \n \n cyanotic heart disease \n acyanotic heart disease \n \n  Cyanotic heart disease  \n Cyanotic heart is where problems with the heart mean there isn't enough oxygen present in the blood. \n Babies born with cyanotic heart disease generally have a blue-coloured tinge to areas such as their fingers, toes and lips because of a lack of oxygen.\u00a0 \n They may also experience symptoms of: \n \n breathlessness \n chest pain \n palpitations \n fainting \n fatigue \n \n Acyanotic heart disease \n Acyanotic heart disease is where the blood contains enough oxygen but it's pumped abnormally around the body. \n Babies born with acyanotic heart disease may not have any apparent symptoms but, over time, the condition can cause health problems. \n In this group of conditions there can be a significant increase in blood pressure, putting the heart under more strain as it works much harder. This can weaken the heart, and increases the risk of developing heart failure, where the muscle is unable to efficiently pump blood around the body. \n In addition, the blood pressure in the lungs is often too high. This is known as pulmonary hypertension and can damage the lungs and cause symptoms such as: \n \n breathlessness \n fatigue \n dizziness \n fainting \n \n How common is congenital heart disease? \n Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition. \n Some babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood. \u00a0 \n Congenital heart disease can sometimes develop alongside certain genetic conditions, such as  Down\u2019s syndrome . \n An infection during pregnancy, such as\u00a0rubella, can also cause congenital heart disease. \n However, many cases of congenital heart disease have no clear cause. \n Outlook for congenital heart disease \n The outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Research into the causes and improved treatments have meant that, 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood.\u00a0 \n This poses new challenges for healthcare services because some of these adults have complex health needs and require life-long specialised care. In response to this, the Department of Health has recommended the creation of specialised centres to care for adults with congenital heart disease.\u00a0 \n Congenital heart disease in adults is sometimes known as \u2018grown-up congenital heart disease\u2019 (GUCH) or Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).", "symptoms": "As stated in the introduction, the two main types of congenital heart disease are: \n \n cyanotic heart disease \n acyanotic heart disease \n \n Symptoms of cyanotic heart disease \n The symptoms of cyanotic heart disease include: \n \n a blue coloured tinge to the lips, fingers and toes (cyanosis) \n palpitations \n fainting \n fatigue \n chest pains \n breathing problems \n \n Children with cyanotic heart disease have lower levels of oxygen in their blood, this is known as hypoxia. \n Sometimes, their oxygen levels can fall further and cause additional symptoms such as anxiety and confusion or disorientation. \n Symptoms of acyanotic heart disease \n The symptoms of acyanotic heart disease include: \n \n severe tiredness \n palpitations \n chest pain \n shortness of breath (particularly during activities such as climbing the stairs) \n \n Common symptoms of congenital heart disease \n There are some symptoms that are present in both cyanotic and acyanotic heart disease. \n These include: \n \n poor appetite and feeding difficulties \n sweating, particularly when a baby is feeding \n delayed growth \n \n Children with acyanotic heart disease are usually underweight, and children with cyanotic heart disease are usually underweight and small for their age.", "causes": "To understand how congenital heart disease can affect your child\u2019s heart and general health, it's useful to first understand how a healthy heart works. \n  Find out how your heart works, on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Congenital heart disease develops when abnormalities in the heart\u2019s structure prevent it from working as it should. \n As outlined in the  introduction , the two main types of congenital heart disease are: \n \n cyanotic heart disease \n acyanotic heart disease \n \n Find common causes of each below. \n Common types of acyanotic heart disease \n Ventricular septal defect (VSD) \n Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a very common cause of acyanotic heart disease. In cases of VSD, there is a hole between the left and right ventricle.\u00a0 \n As blood pressure is higher on the left-hand side of the heart, blood is pushed through the hole and into the right ventricle. \n The heart then has to work harder to pump the excess blood out of the right ventricle, which can put a strain on the heart. The excess level and pressure of the blood can also increase the blood pressure in the lungs and damage them (pulmonary hypertension). \n Atrial septal defect (ASD) \n Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a similar type of defect to VSD, but the hole is between the left and right atria rather than the ventricles. \n ASD can place extra strain on the heart, and potentially damage the lungs. \n When referring to a \u2018hole in the heart\u2019, healthcare professionals are usually referring to either VSD or ASD. \n  Find out more about ASD on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Pulmonary stenosis \n In pulmonary stenosis, the pulmonary valve in the right side of the heart is unusually narrow meaning that the heart has to work harder to pump blood into the lungs, which can put a strain on the heart. \n  Find out more about pulmonary stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Aortic stenosis \n In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve in the left side of the heart is unusually narrow, which means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the valve. \n Because the aortic valve is the main route for oxygen-rich blood to supply the body, the narrowing can lower the body\u2019s oxygen supply, which can cause symptoms of breathlessness and dizziness. \n  Find out more about aortic stenosis on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) \n Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) is a duct or passage in the heart that is meant to close shortly after birth. \n When an unborn baby is in the womb, there is no need for the baby\u2019s heart to send blood to the lungs because the baby is getting all the oxygen it needs from the mother through the placenta. \n Therefore, the ductus ateriosus acts as a bypass, meaning that the blood can flow back into the heart without entering the lungs. \n Shortly after birth, the duct should close as the baby begins to breathe normally. However, in cases of PDA, the duct fails to completely close, which means that some oxygen-rich blood that is meant to be pumped away from the lungs leaks back through the duct and back into the lungs. \n This can place strain on the heart and the lungs because they have to work harder to compensate for the problems caused by the duct. \n Common types of cyanotic heart disease \n Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) \n Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic heart disease. TOF is not one heart defect but a combination of four different heart defects. Tetralogy is a Greek word that means \u2018four-fold\u2019, and Fallot is the name of the doctor who first identified the condition. \n In cases of TOF, there are four defects that affect the heart: \n \n A hole between the left and right ventricle (Ventricular Septal Defect). \n A narrowing of the pulmonary valve (pulmonary stenosis). \n The muscles of the right ventricle are unusually thick (right ventricular hypertrophy). \n The aorta sits over both the left and right ventricles, instead of just the left ventricle in a normal heart (overriding aorta). \n \n As a result of this complex set of heart defects, oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-low blood become mixed. This leads to blood with lower-than-normal oxygen content being pumped around the body. \n As the body\u2019s cells and tissue are not receiving enough oxygen, the child will develop symptoms of cyanotic heart disease. \n  Find out more about TOF on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) \n Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a major cause of cyanotic heart disease. \n In cases of TGA, the pulmonary artery is attached to the left side of the heart, and the aorta is attached to the right side of the heart. This leads to oxygen-low blood, which should be pumped into the lungs, being pumped around the body, causing symptoms of cyanotic heart disease. \n  Find out more about TGA on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Risk factors for congenital heart disease \n In many cases of congenital heart disease, there is no clear reason why a baby is born with a defective heart.\u00a0 \n The known risk factors for congenital heart disease are listed below. \n Maternal diabetes \n Women with diabetes are five times more likely to give birth to a baby with congenital heart disease compared with women who do not have diabetes. \n It is estimated that out of every 100 pregnancies in women with diabetes, three to four will result in the birth of a baby with a heart defect.\u00a0 \n The increased risk is thought to be due to the high levels of insulin in the blood, which may interfere with the development of the foetus. \n Rubella \n The viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) is a major risk factor for congenital heart disease if a woman contracts an infection during early pregnancy. \n If a woman contracts the viral infection rubella (also known as German measles) during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, there is an 80% chance that her baby will be born with a birth defect, such as congenital heart disease. \n Maternal alcohol abuse \n Mothers who exceed the recommended daily alcohol intake during pregnancy have an increased risk of their baby being born with congenital heart disease.\u00a0 \n Alcohol is best avoided during pregnancy; however no more than 2-3 units should be consumed on a daily basis for any adult. \n Genetic conditions \n There are a number of genetic conditions (health conditions that a baby inherits from one or both parents) that can cause congenital heart disease. \n Down\u2019s syndrome is the most widely known genetic condition that can cause congenital heart disease. Down\u2019s syndrome is a condition where children are born with a range of disabilities as the result of a genetic abnormality. Approximately half of children with Down\u2019s syndrome will have congenital heart disease. \n Other genetic conditions linked to congenital heart disease include: \n \n Turner syndrome \n Noonan syndrome", "treatment": "There are a number of different surgical techniques that can be used to treat congenital heart disease. Some of these are explained below. \n Catheters \n A catheter, similar to the tube that is used during diagnosis, is inserted into the heart and tools are passed down the catheter to repair the heart defects. \n The advantage of this type of surgery is that it's minimally invasive, which means that your child will not have to have open heart surgery. \n Open heart surgery \n For more serious types of heart defects, it may be necessary to operate directly on the heart. \n During open heart surgery, the heart may be stopped and a machine used to pump blood around your child\u2019s body (bypass machine). An incision is made in your child\u2019s chest so that the heart defects can be surgically repaired, or damaged parts of the heart, such as the valves, can be replaced. \n Heart transplant \n In more serious cases of congenital heart disease, the heart may be too damaged, and the child too ill, for corrective surgery to be safely carried out. In this circumstance, their heart may have to be replaced with a donated heart. \n If your child requires a heart transplant, their details will be placed on the National Transplant Database (NTD). Depending on the condition of your child\u2019s heart, it may be necessary to keep them in hospital in order to support the function of their heart until a donated heart becomes available. Machines, such as the ventricle assist device (VAD), act like an external mechanical heart, and can assist in pumping blood around the body. \n Priority for heart transplants is based on clinical need, rather than on a first-come-first-served basis. If your child is in a very unstable condition, they will be prioritised whereas more stable children will have to wait for a longer period of time. \n Once a donated heart of the right size and blood group becomes available, you will be contacted by the transplant team and asked to go to the transplant unit as soon as possible. You may be given a bleeper so that you can be contacted as soon as possible. \n  Find out more about heart transplantation on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Treatment for common types of congenital heart disease \n Specific treatments for the most common types of congenital heart disease are described below. \n Septal defects \n If your child is diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or an atrial septal defect (ASD), the recommended treatment will depend on the size of the defect. \n If the defect is small, a policy of \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 may be recommended, where your child receives no immediate treatment but their health is carefully monitored. This is because 90% of small defects will close as the child grows older. \n In cases of mild to medium-sized defects, it may be possible to seal the defect using a catheter. The catheter is guided to the site of the hole, and a specially designed mesh is passed through the catheter to seal the defect. \n In cases of medium to large-sized defects, open-heart surgery may be required. This involves a patch being stitched directly over the defect. \n Stenosis \n If your child is diagnosed with a stenosis (a narrowing one of their valves) the treatment that is recommended will depend on the extent of the stenosis and if they are symptomatic. \n In mild cases, a policy of \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 may be recommended. Medication that lowers blood pressure may also be recommended to reduce the strain on your child\u2019s heart and lungs. \n In more serious cases of stenosis, a catheter can be used to widen the valve. A small balloon is passed up through the catheter and then inflated to widen the affected valve. This is known as a balloon angioplasty. Once the valve has been widened, the balloon is removed. Sometimes, a metal coil (stent) is used to keep the valve widened. \n In more serious cases of stenosis, it's sometimes necessary to replace the valve using open heart surgery. Replacement valves can be obtained from human donors, or made from artificial materials, such as titanium, or taken from pigs and modified for human use. Pigs are used because their hearts are the most similar to the human heart. \n For people who are too ill or weak to withstand the effects of open heart surgery, a catheter approach can be used. The catheter is passed through a blood vessel in the groin and up into the heart. A replacement valve is passed through the catheter and into position. \n Patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) \n Many cases of patent ductus ateriosus (PDA) can be treated shortly after birth, using medication. \n Two types of medication - indomethacin and a special type of ibuprofen - have been shown to effectively stimulate the closure of the duct that is responsible for PDA. \n If a PDA does not respond to medication, a catheter can be used to seal the duct with a metal coil or plug. \n Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) \n Babies born with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) who are experiencing severe symptoms of breathlessness may require emergency surgery such as a Blalock-Taussig shunt (a BT shunt). \n During a BT shunt, an artery is diverted (or shunted) into the lungs so that a supply of oxygen-rich blood becomes available. Further open-heart surgery is then recommended when the baby is old enough to withstand the after-effects of surgery. During open-heart surgery, the defect between the ventricles is sealed and the pulmonary valve is widened. \n Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) \n Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) will require open-heart surgery, which is usually done shortly after your baby is born. \n A surgical technique, known as an arterial switch, is usually used to treat cases of TGA. During an arterial switch, the affected arteries are cut and reattached to their correct position on the other side of the heart. \n Congenital heart disease in adulthood \n About 80% of children with congenital heart disease will survive into adulthood. Living as an adult with congenital heart disease involves a new set of challenges. Some adults will require specialised care. \n Routine medical procedures, such as giving birth or having a general anaesthetic, will need to be closely supervised by specialist staff with experience in treating adults with congenital heart disease. There is also the risk that previous heart surgery, such as the insertion of a replacement valve, will fail and that further surgery will be required. \n Due to these factors, it's recommended that older teenagers register with a specialised adult congenital heart disease clinic. The clinic will be able to provide regular check-ups and assessments, liaise with other specialised medical services as required, and provide on-going support and advice. \n Your GP or treatment team can give you more information about services in your area for adults with congenital heart disease.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "An increasing number of cases of congenital heart disease are now diagnosed by carrying out a foetal echocardiograph before a baby is born. \n A foetal echocardiograph is made possible by using a type of ultrasound scanner that has been specially designed to build a picture of the unborn baby\u2019s heart. It should be carried out during routine antenatal examinations, usually sometime between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy. \n It is not always possible to detect heart defects (particularly mild ones) using a foetal echocardiography. \n Postnatal diagnosis \n If a baby is born with cyanotic heart disease, a diagnosis can usually be made quickly and confidently due to the distinctive blue colour of their skin. \n If your baby is born with acyanotic heart disease, their symptoms may not become immediately apparent for several months, or possibly years, after birth.\u00a0 \n Possible signs that your child may have a cyanotic heart disease include: \n \n problems feeding \n slow growth \n shortness of breath after exercising \n tiredness after exercising \n swelling of their hands, feet and ankles \n \n You should contact your GP if your child has any of the above symptoms. Further testing can confirm or disprove a diagnosis of congenital heart disease. \n Further testing\u00a0 \n Echocardiogram \n An echocardiogram may be used to check your child\u2019s heart. Sometimes, underlying problems with the heart, which were missed during a foetal echocardiogram, can be detected as a child grows up. \n  Find out more about an echocardiogram on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Electrocardiogram (ECG) \n An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the child\u2019s heart. Electrodes are placed on the skin across the chest, arms and legs, and then connected to an ECG machine. The machine analyses the electrical signals produced by the heart in order to assess the heart rhythm. \n  Find out more about an ECG on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Chest X-ray \n A chest X-ray of the heart and lungs can check whether there are any abnormalities in the lungs, or whether the heart is larger than normal. Both of these can be signs of congenital heart disease. \n  Find out more about a chest x-ray on the British Heart Foundation website . \n Pulse oximetry \n Pulse oximetry is a test that measures how much oxygen is present in the blood.\u00a0 \n The test involves placing a special sensor on your child\u2019s fingertip, ear or toe. The sensor sends out light waves. A computer that is connected to the sensor measures how the light waves are being absorbed, and gives a percentage reading.\u00a0 \n A healthy person should have a reading of 94% or above. It is common for those with cyanotic heart defects to have readings below this value. \n Cardiac catheterisation \n Cardiac catheterisation is a useful way of finding out more information about exactly how the blood is pumping through the child\u2019s heart. \n During a cardiac catheterisation, a small flexible tube, known as a catheter, will be inserted into one of the child\u2019s blood vessels, usually in the groin or arm. The tube is moved up into the heart, using X-rays to help guide it. \n A contrast dye that shows up on X-rays can be injected into the tube. The dye can then be studied as it moves through the heart, enabling medical staff to see how well each chamber of the heart is working. Blood pressure readings in different parts of the heart can also be taken; this will help with diagnosis and treatment planning. \n Cardiac catheterisation is usually performed under a local anaesthetic and is a relatively painless procedure."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Coma", "introduction": "A coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken. \n It can result from injury to the brain, such as a\u00a0 severe head injury \u00a0or  stroke . A coma can also be caused by severe  alcohol poisoning \u00a0or a brain infection (encephalitis). \n People with\u00a0 diabetes \u00a0could fall into a coma if their blood glucose levels suddenly became very low  (hypoglycaemia)  or very high  (hyperglycaemia) .\u00a0 \n What is a coma? \n Someone who is in a coma is unconscious and has minimal brain activity. They're alive, but\u00a0can't be woken up and show no signs of being aware. \n The person's eyes will be closed and\u00a0they'll\u00a0appear to be unresponsive to their environment. They won't\u00a0normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily. \n Someone in a coma will also have very reduced basic reflexes such as coughing and swallowing. They may be able to breathe on their own, although some people require a machine to help them breathe. \n Over time, the person may start to gradually regain consciousness and become more aware. Some people will wake up after a few weeks, while others may go into a vegetative state or minimally conscious state (see  recovering from a coma ,\u00a0below). \n Caring for and monitoring a person in a coma \n Doctors assess a person's level of consciousness using a tool called the  Glasgow Coma Scale . This level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses three things: \n \n eye opening \u2013 a score of one means no eye opening, and\u00a0four means opens eyes spontaneously \n verbal response to a command \u2013 a score of one\u00a0means no response, and\u00a0five means alert and talking \n voluntary movements in response to a command \u2013 a score of one means no response, and six means obeys commands \n \n Most people in a coma will have a total score of\u00a0eight or less.\u00a0A lower score means someone may have experienced more severe brain damage and could be less likely to recover. \n In the short term, a person in a coma will normally be looked after\u00a0in an intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment involves ensuring their condition is stable and their body functions, such as breathing and blood pressure, are supported while the underlying cause is treated. \n In the longer term, healthcare staff will give supportive treatment on a hospital ward. This can involve providing nutrition, trying to prevent infections, moving the person regularly so they don't develop bedsores, and gently exercising their joints to\u00a0stop them\u00a0becoming tight. \n What you can do as a visitor \n The experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. Some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they\u00a0were in a coma, while others don't. \n Some people have reported feeling enormous reassurance from the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma. \n When visiting a friend or loved one in a coma, you may find the advice below helpful: \n \n when you arrive, announce who you are \n talk to them about your day as you normally would\u00a0\u2013\u00a0be aware that everything you say in front of them might be heard \n show them your love and support\u00a0\u2013 even just sitting and holding their hand or stroking their skin can be\u00a0a great comfort \n \n Research has also suggested that\u00a0stimulating the main senses \u2013 touch, hearing, vision and smell\u00a0\u2013 could potentially help\u00a0a person\u00a0recover from a coma. \n As well as talking to the person and holding their hand, you might want to try playing them their favourite music through headphones, putting flowers in their room or spraying a favourite perfume. \n Recovering from a coma \n A coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state. \n \n a vegetative state \u2013 where a person is awake but shows no signs of being aware of their surroundings or themselves \n a minimally conscious state \u2013 where a person has limited awareness that comes and goes \n \n Some people may recover from these states gradually, while others may not improve for years, if at all.\u00a0 \n People who do wake up from\u00a0a coma usually come round gradually. They may be very agitated and confused to begin with. \n Some people will make a full recovery and be completely unaffected by the coma. Others\u00a0will have disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. They may need\u00a0physiotherapy,  occupational therapy \u00a0and psychological assessment and support during a period of rehabilitation, and may need care for the rest of their lives. \n The\u00a0chances of someone recovering from a coma largely depend on the severity and\u00a0cause of their brain injury, their age and how long they've been in\u00a0a coma. But it's impossible to accurately predict whether the person\u00a0will eventually recover,\u00a0how long the coma will last and whether they'll have any long-term problems. \n Further information and support \n For further information and support from healthcare professionals and the families of people in a coma, you may find the following\u00a0websites helpful: \n \n  Brain and Spine Foundation  \n  Headway : the brain injury association \n  ICUsteps : the intensive care patient support charity", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

This means most people will be infectious for around two weeks. \n You can catch the virus from an infectious person by: \n \n touching an object or surface contaminated by infected droplets and\u00a0then touching your mouth, nose or eyes \n touching the skin of someone who has the infected droplets on their skin and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes \n inhaling tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these are launched into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes \n \n Colds spread most easily among groups of people in constant close contact, such as families and children in school or day care facilities. They're also more frequent during the winter, although it's not clear exactly why. \n A\u00a0number of different\u00a0viruses can cause a cold, so it's possible to have several colds one after the other, as each one\u00a0may be\u00a0caused by a different virus. \n How can I\u00a0stop a cold spreading? \n You can take some simple steps to help prevent the spread of a cold. For example: \n \n wash your hands regularly, particularly\u00a0before touching your nose or mouth and before handling food \n always sneeze and cough into tissues \u2013 this will help prevent the virus-containing droplets from your nose and mouth entering the air, where they can infect others; you should\u00a0throw away used tissues immediately and wash your hands\u00a0 \n clean surfaces regularly to keep them free of germs\u00a0 \n use your own cup, plates, cutlery and kitchen utensils \n don't share towels or toys with someone who has a cold \n \n It's been suggested that vitamin C,\u00a0zinc\u00a0 and garlic supplements may help reduce your risk of getting a cold, but there's currently not enough strong evidence to support this.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of a cold usually develop within a few days of becoming infected. \n The main symptoms include: \n \n a  sore throat  \n a blocked or runny nose \n sneezing \n a  cough  \n a hoarse voice \n generally feeling unwell \n \n Less common symptoms of a cold include: \n \n a high temperature (fever) \u2013 this is usually about 37-39C (98.6-102.2F) \n a  headache  \n  earache  \u2013 severe earache may be a sign of a  middle ear infection  \n muscle pain \n loss of taste and smell \n mild irritation of your eyes \n a feeling of pressure in your ears and face\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n The symptoms are usually at their worst during the first two to three days, before they gradually start to improve. In adults and older children, they usually last about 7 to 10 days, but can last longer.

Aspirin may also help, but it isn't normally recommended for a cold and should never be given to children under the age of 16. \n If your child has a cold,\u00a0look for age-appropriate versions of paracetamol and ibuprofen (usually in liquid form). Always follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the correct dose is given. \n Taking both ibuprofen and paracetamol at the same time is not usually necessary for a cold and should be avoided\u00a0in children\u00a0as using both together may be unsafe.\u00a0 \n Paracetamol and ibuprofen are also included in some cold medicines. If you're taking\u00a0painkillers and want to also take a cold medicine, check the patient information leaflet first or ask your pharmacist or GP for advice to avoid exceeding the recommended dose. \n If you're pregnant, paracetamol is the preferred choice to treat mild to moderate pain and fever. \n Decongestants \n Decongestants can be taken by mouth (oral decongestants), or as drops or a spray into your nose (nasal decongestants). They can help make breathing easier\u00a0by reducing the swelling inside your nose. \n However, they're generally only effective for a short period and they can make your blocked nose worse if they're used for more than a week. \n Decongestants are not recommended for children under six years old and children under 12 years old shouldn't take them unless advised by a pharmacist or GP. They're also not suitable for people with certain underlying conditions and those taking certain medications. \n Read more about  who can use decongestant medication  \n Other remedies \n The remedies outlined below may also help\u00a0relieve your symptoms. \n Gargling and menthol sweets \n Some people find\u00a0gargling with salt water and sucking on menthol sweets can help relieve a\u00a0 sore throat  and blocked nose. \n Vapour rubs \n Vapour rubs can help babies and young children breathe more easily when they have a cold. Apply the rub to your child's chest and back. Don't apply it to their nostrils because this could cause\u00a0irritation and breathing difficulties. \n Nasal saline drops \n Nasal saline (salt water) drops can help relieve a blocked nose in babies and young children. \n Vitamin and mineral supplements \n There is some evidence to suggest that\u00a0taking\u00a0zinc supplements within a day of the symptoms starting will speed up recovery from a cold and reduce the severity of symptoms. \n However, there is currently little evidence to suggest that taking vitamin C\u00a0supplements is beneficial when a cold starts. \n Treatments\u00a0not recommended \n The following treatments aren't usually recommended to treat colds because there isn't strong evidence to suggest they're effective, and they\u00a0may cause unpleasant side effects: \n \n antihistamines \n  cough \u00a0treatments or syrups \n  antibiotics  \u2013 these are only effective against bacteria (colds are caused by viruses) \n complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u00a0treatments such as echinacea and Chinese herbal medicines", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Cold sore", "introduction": "Cold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They're caused by the herpes simplex virus and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. \n You\u00a0may not\u00a0have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus. An outbreak of cold sores may\u00a0happen some time later. \n Cold sores often start with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip. \n Read more about the  symptoms of cold sores . \n When to visit your GP \n If you've had outbreaks of cold sores before, it's likely that you'll know what they are if they return. \n You only need to visit your GP if you're unsure whether it's a cold sore or if it's severe and spreading further than just the lip. See your GP\u00a0if\u00a0a cold sore hasn't healed after 7 to 10 days. \n What causes cold sores? \n The strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as HSV-1. \n In rare cases,\u00a0cold sores\u00a0can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can\u00a0be the result of having oral sex with someone who has\u00a0 genital herpes . \n Read more about the  causes of cold sores . \n Herpes simplex virus \n The herpes simplex virus\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or \"cold sore virus\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time. \n However, every so often the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person, but can include sunlight,\u00a0fatigue, an injury to the affected area, and, in women, their period. \n Some people have frequently recurring cold sores around two or three times a year, while others have one cold sore and never have another. Some people never get cold sores at all because the virus never becomes active. \n Treating cold sores \n Cold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days. \n However, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time. \n To be effective, these treatments\u00a0should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear\u00a0\u2013 when you\u00a0feel\u00a0a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect. \n Cold sore patches are also available that contain hydrocolloid gel, which is an effective treatment for skin wounds. The patch is placed over the cold sore while it heals. \n Antiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases. \n Read more about  treating cold sores . \n Complications of cold sores \n Cold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications. \n  Dehydration  sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated. \n The herpes simplex virus can also spread to other parts of your body. Examples of when this can occur include: \n \n skin infections\u00a0\u2013 these often\u00a0occur if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as a\u00a0 cut or graze , or\u00a0a skin condition such as\u00a0 eczema  \n herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger)\u00a0\u2013 this\u00a0causes\u00a0painful sores and blisters to appear on and around your fingers \n herpetic keratoconjunctivitis\u00a0\u2013 this causes swelling and irritation (inflammation) of your eye area and sores to develop on your eyelids \n \n Left untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of your eye, to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness. \n It's therefore important not to touch your eyes if you have an unhealed cold sore. If you must touch your eyes\u00a0\u2013 for example, to remove contact lenses\u00a0\u2013 wash your hands thoroughly first. \n In very rare cases,\u00a0encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen, can be caused by the cold sore virus spreading to the brain. It can be treated with intravenous injections of antiviral medications, such as\u00a0aciclovir. \n Preventing infection \n It's not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection. \n Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they're completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared. \n However, there's no need to stay away from work or miss school\u00a0if you or your child have a cold sore. \n You can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by following the advice below: \n \n avoid touching cold sores unless you're applying cold sore cream\u00a0\u2013 creams should be dabbed on gently rather than rubbed in,\u00a0as this can damage your skin further \n always wash your hands before and after applying cold sore cream and after touching the affected area \n don't share cold sore creams or medication with other people\u00a0as this can cause the infection to spread \n don't share items that come into contact with the affected area, such as lipsticks or cutlery \n avoid kissing and oral sex until your cold sores have completely healed \n be particularly careful around newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a low immune system, such as those with\u00a0 HIV  or those having  chemotherapy  \n if you know what usually triggers your cold sores, try to avoid the triggers\u00a0\u2013 for example, a sun block lip balm (SPF 15 or higher) may help prevent cold sores triggered by bright sunlight", "symptoms": "You won't usually have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus (the primary infection). \n An outbreak of cold sores may occur some time later and keep coming back (recurrent infection). \n However, if the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe. \n Herpes simplex virus primary infection \n In children \n Symptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than five years old. Symptoms include: \n \n swollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth\u00a0\u2013 this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis \n  sore throat \u00a0and swollen glands \n producing more saliva than normal \n high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n  dehydration  \n feeling sick (nausea) \n  headaches \u00a0 \n \n Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also\u00a0develop it. It can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to three weeks to heal. However, gingivostomatitis doesn't usually recur after the primary infection. \n In adults \n Primary herpes simplex viruses are rare in adults, but the symptoms are similar to those experienced by children. \n You'll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. You may also have\u00a0bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. These can develop into\u00a0 ulcers  with grey or yellow centres. \n If you develop the herpes simplex virus at an early age, it may be triggered periodically in later life and can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. After the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves. \n Recurrent infections (cold sores) \n Recurrent infections usually last for less time and are\u00a0less severe than the primary infection. The only symptom is an outbreak of cold sores, although you may also have swollen glands. \n An outbreak of cold sores usually starts with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then develop, usually on the edges of your lower lip. \n If you have frequent recurrent infections, you may develop cold sores in the same place every time. They may grow in size and cause irritation and pain. Initially, they may ooze before crusting or scabbing over within 48 hours of the initial tingling sensation. \n If the cold sores are very troublesome, it's possible to suppress them by taking an antiviral tablet called acyclovir regularly, every day for a few months. This is usually only recommended if cold sores are causing a lot of problems, and they may come back when treatment is stopped. \n Most cold sores disappear within 7 to 10 days without treatment and usually heal without scarring.", "causes": "Cold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). \n In most cases the virus is passed on in early childhood\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore. \n The virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it's triggered at a later date. \n Cold sore triggers \n Factors thought to trigger outbreaks of cold sores include: \n \n having another infection, such as a\u00a0respiratory tract infection \n having a high temperature (fever) \n emotional upset or psychological  stress  \n tiredness and fatigue \n an injury to the affected area \n menstruation (periods) \n strong sunlight \n \n However, in many cases there's no obvious trigger for an outbreak. \n Herpes simplex virus type 2 \n Occasionally, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). \n This can happen after having oral sex with a man or woman who has  genital herpes , which is usually caused by HSV-2. \n In genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area.", "treatment": "Cold sores usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. Antiviral tablets or cream can be used to ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time. \n If you develop a cold sore, some general advice to follow includes: \n \n drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration \n avoid acidic or salty foods and eat cool, soft foods \n if brushing your teeth is painful, use an antiseptic mouthwash \n dab creams on to sores rather than rubbing\u00a0them in \n wash your hands using soap and water before and after applying cold sore creams \n avoid touching your cold sores, other than to apply cream, and don't share your cold sore cream with others \n \n Antiviral creams and tablets \n Antiviral\u00a0creams such as\u00a0aciclovir or penciclovir (also known as Fenistil) may speed up the healing time of a recurrent cold sore infection\u00a0if used correctly. \n Cold sore\u00a0creams are widely available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. \n They're only effective if you apply them as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear, when the herpes simplex virus is spreading and replicating. Using an antiviral\u00a0cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much effect. \n If you have frequently recurring bouts of cold sores,\u00a0use antiviral medication\u00a0as soon as you feel the tingling sensation that\u00a0indicates a cold sore is about to develop. You'll need to apply the cream up to five times a day for four to five days. \n Antiviral creams can only help to\u00a0heal a current outbreak of cold sores. They don't get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of cold sores occurring. \n Antiviral tablets are generally more effective than creams at treating cold sores, but are usually only prescribed for more severe cases. \n Cold sore patches \n Cold sore patches that contain a special gel called hydrocolloid are also available. They're an effective treatment for skin wounds and are placed over the cold sore to hide the sore area while it heals. \n Non-antiviral treatments \n Several non-antiviral creams are also available over the counter\u00a0from pharmacies\u00a0without the need for a prescription. \n These creams aren't specifically designed to treat cold sores and won't help them heal faster, but they\u00a0may help ease any pain or\u00a0irritation. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a suitable treatment for you. \n Pain can also be treated with painkillers such as  ibuprofen  or  paracetamol \u00a0\u2013 both are available in liquid form for young children. \n However, don't take ibuprofen if you have\u00a0 asthma  or\u00a0 stomach ulcers , or you've had them in the past. \n Children under the age of 16 shouldn't be given aspirin. \n Speak to your GP if you have cold sores and you're pregnant. \n Treating complications \n If your cold sores are particularly severe or your immune system is damaged\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have\u00a0 HIV  or you're having  chemotherapy  treatment \u2013\u00a0you may be at risk of developing serious complications. \n For example, your risk of developing\u00a0encephalitis\u00a0or the infection spreading to other parts of your body, such as your eyes, is increased. \n Visit your GP if you're at risk. They\u00a0may prescribe antiviral tablets and refer you for specialist treatment. \n The type of treatment recommended will depend on the severity of your cold sore symptoms and the complication that's causing problems. \n For example, if you develop herpetic keratoconjunctivitis\u00a0\u2013 a secondary eye infection\u00a0\u2013\u00a0you may need to see an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor. \n Gingivostomatitis \n Visit your GP if you or your child develops\u00a0swollen, painful gums (gingivostomatitis) as a result of\u00a0the primary herpes simplex infection. They'll be able to suggest treatments to help ease your symptoms. \n If the infection is painful, your GP may suggest using a preparation that contains benzydamine, which is available as an\u00a0oral rinse or oral spray, to help relieve any pain in your mouth or throat. \n Brushing your teeth may also be painful because of the swelling of your gums. Your GP may suggest using an antiseptic mouthwash. This helps prevent secondary infections and will also control a build-up of plaque if you can't brush your teeth effectively. \n As with the treatment of cold sores, any pain or fever can be treated using ibuprofen or paracetamol. \n In rare cases of gingivostomatitis, it's possible for your lips to become stuck together in places. Using a lip barrier cream available from your local pharmacist will help prevent this. \n Dehydration \n If you or your child has gingivostomatitis, it's important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Young children are particularly at risk\u00a0as they may refuse to eat or drink because of\u00a0the pain in their mouth. \n It's important to watch out for signs of\u00a0 dehydration , such as: \n \n  headaches  \n tiredness \n irritability \n lightheadedness \n low urine output \n \n Most cases of gingivostomatitis get better in 7 to 14 days, although it may take up to three weeks for the sores to heal completely. \n Specialist treatment \n If you or your child still has symptoms of gingivostomatitis after two weeks or the infection is severe, go back to your GP, who may refer you for specialist treatment. \n Specialist referral may also be needed for gingivostomatitis if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system. \n Visit your GP if you have a newborn baby who develops gingivostomatitis, as they may also need to be referred for specialist treatment.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

Only about 24% of them are ever diagnosed. \n Coeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age, and presents in both children and adults. \n Reported cases of coeliac disease are twice as high in women than men. \n Symptoms \n Coeliac disease can cause a wide range of symptoms in the digestive system and rest of the body. \n Symptoms can be similar to those in other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some people may have no symptoms at all. \n Symptoms can develop at any age, but coeliac disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60 years. \n More about the  symptoms of coeliac disease  \n Causes \n Coeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions and in relatives of people with coeliac disease. It's unknown exactly why people develop the condition. \n More about the  causes of coeliac disease  \n Diagnosis \n Most people with coeliac disease have antibodies in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis is a simple blood test. The second stage is a biopsy. \n More about  how coeliac disease is diagnosed  \n Treatment \n Coeliac disease can be effectively treated with a gluten-free diet. By adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, you can self-manage your condition and improve your quality of life. \n More about  how coeliac disease is treated  \n Complications \n If coeliac disease remains untreated, you're at greater risk of conditions like osteoporosis and cancer in later life. \n More about the  complications of coeliac disease", "symptoms": "Symptoms of coeliac disease vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. \n Sometimes the symptoms of coeliac disease are mistaken for: \n \n irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) \n wheat intolerance \n stress \n just getting older \n \n Common symptoms \n Some common symptoms of coeliac disease include: \n \n severe or occasional diarrhoea, excessive wind and constipation \n persistent or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms \u2013 such as nausea and vomiting \n recurrent stomach pain, cramping or bloating \n a combination of iron, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency \n anaemia \n tiredness and headaches \n sudden or unexpected weight loss (but not in all cases) \n mouth ulcers \n dermatitis herpetiformis \n tooth enamel problems \n liver abnormalities \n unexplained neurological (nerve) problems such as ataxia (poor muscle coordination) and neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the hands and feet) \n \n If you've any of these symptoms, speak to your GP but continue eating gluten as part of your diet until diagnosis is confirmed. \n Symptoms in children \n Children with coeliac disease might not grow at the expected rate, or be late to reach puberty.", "causes": "It's not known exactly why people develop coeliac disease or why some have mild symptoms while others have severe symptoms.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Clostridium difficile", "introduction": "Clostridium difficile, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, is a bacterium that can infect the bowel and cause diarrhoea. \n The infection most commonly affects people who have recently been treated with  antibiotics , but can spread easily to others. \n C. difficile\u00a0infections are unpleasant and can sometimes\u00a0cause\u00a0serious bowel problems, but\u00a0they can usually be treated with another course of antibiotics. \n This page covers: \n  Symptoms of a C. difficile infection  \n  Who's most\u00a0at risk of C. difficile?  \n  When to get medical advice  \n  Treatment for C. difficile  \n  Looking after yourself at home  \n  How you get C. difficile  \n  How to stop C. difficile spreading  \n Symptoms of a C. difficile infection \n Symptoms of a C. difficile\u00a0infection usually develop when you're taking antibiotics, or when you've finished taking them within the last few weeks. \n The most common symptoms are: \n \n watery  diarrhoea , which can be bloody \n painful tummy cramps \n feeling sick \n  signs of dehydration , such as\u00a0a  dry mouth ,\u00a0 headaches  and peeing less often than normal \n a high temperature (fever) of above 38C (100.4F) \n loss of appetite and weight loss \n \n In\u00a0some cases, serious complications can develop, such as damage to the bowel or severe dehydration, which may cause\u00a0drowsiness, confusion, a rapid heart rate and fainting. \n Who's most at risk of C. difficile? \n C. difficile mostly affects people who: \n \n have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (antibiotics that work against\u00a0several types of bacteria) or several different antibiotics at the same time, or those\u00a0taking\u00a0long-term antibiotics \n have had to stay\u00a0in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or care home, for a long time \n are over 65 years old \n have\u00a0certain underlying\u00a0conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),\u00a0 cancer  or\u00a0 kidney disease  \n have a weakened immune system, which can be because of a condition such as\u00a0 diabetes  or a side effect of a treatment such as\u00a0 chemotherapy  or\u00a0 steroid medication  \n are taking\u00a0a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of stomach acid they produce \n have had surgery on their digestive system \n \n Many C. difficile infections used to occur in places where many people take antibiotics and are in close contact with each other, such as hospitals and\u00a0care homes. \n However, strict infection control measures have helped to reduce this risk, and an increasing\u00a0number of C. difficile infections now occur outside these settings. \n When to get medical advice \n Visiting your GP surgery with a possible C. difficile infection\u00a0can put others at risk, so it's best to call your GP or NHS 111 if you're concerned or feel you need advice. \n Get medical advice if: \n \n you have persistent diarrhoea after finishing\u00a0a course of\u00a0antibiotics \n you have bloody diarrhoea \n you have diarrhoea and\u00a0experience\u00a0severe tummy pain,\u00a0a high fever, a rapid heart rate or fainting \n you have  symptoms of severe dehydration , such as confusion, drowsiness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all \n \n Diarrhoea can be caused by a number of conditions and is\u00a0a common side effect of antibiotics, so having diarrhoea while taking antibiotics doesn't necessarily mean you have a\u00a0C. difficile infection. \n Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your\u00a0poo to confirm whether you have C. difficile. A\u00a0 blood test  may also be carried out to help determine how severe the infection is, and sometimes you may need tests or scans in hospital to check if your bowel is damaged. \n Treatment for C. difficile \n Your GP will decide whether you need hospital treatment (if you're not already in hospital). If\u00a0the infection is\u00a0relatively mild, you may be treated at home. \n If you're in hospital, you\u00a0might be moved to a room of your own during treatment to reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others. \n Treatment for C. difficile can include: \n \n stopping\u00a0the antibiotics thought to be causing the infection, if possible \u2013 in mild cases, this may be the only treatment that's needed \n taking a 10 to 14-day course of antibiotics that are known to kill C. difficile bacteria \n rarely,\u00a0serious\u00a0infections may\u00a0require\u00a0surgery to remove a damaged section of the bowel \n \n C. difficile infections\u00a0usually respond well to treatment, with most people making a full recovery in a week or two. However, the symptoms come back in around 1 in 5 cases and treatment may need to be repeated. \n Looking after yourself at home \n If you're well enough to be treated at home, the following measures can help\u00a0relieve your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading: \n \n make sure you finish the entire course of any antibiotics you're prescribed, even if you're feeling better \n drink plenty of fluids to avoid\u00a0dehydration and eat plain foods such as\u00a0soup, rice, pasta and bread\u00a0if you feel hungry \n take\u00a0 paracetamol  for tummy pain or a fever \n don't\u00a0take\u00a0anti-diarrhoeal medication, as this can stop the infection being cleared from your body \n regularly wash your hands and contaminated surfaces, objects or sheets (see\u00a0 How to\u00a0stop C. difficile spreading ) \n stay at home until at least 48 hours after your last episode of diarrhoea \n \n Your GP may contact you regularly to make sure you're getting better. Call\u00a0them if your symptoms return after treatment finishes, as it may need to be repeated. \n How you get C. difficile \n C. difficile bacteria are found in the\u00a0digestive system\u00a0of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. The bacteria\u00a0often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control. \n However, some antibiotics can interfere with the balance of bacteria in\u00a0the bowel, which\u00a0can cause the C. difficile bacteria to multiply\u00a0and produce toxins that make the person ill. \n When this happens, C. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person's diarrhoea. \n Once out of the body, the bacteria turn into resistant cells called spores. These can survive for long periods on hands, surfaces (such as toilets), objects and clothing unless they're thoroughly cleaned, and can infect someone else if they get into their mouth. \n Someone with a C. difficile infection is generally considered to be infectious until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up. \n How to stop C. difficile spreading \n C.\u00a0difficile\u00a0infections can\u00a0be passed on\u00a0very easily. You can reduce your risk of picking it up or spreading it by practising good hygiene, both at home\u00a0and in healthcare settings. \n The following measures can help: \n \n stay at home until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up \n wash your hands regularly with soap and water, particularly after going to the toilet\u00a0and before eating\u00a0\u2013 use liquid rather than bar soap and don't use flannels or nail brushes \n clean contaminated surfaces\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as the toilet, flush handle, light switches and door handles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0with a bleach-based cleaner after each use \n don't share towels and flannels \n wash contaminated clothes and sheets separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature \n when visiting someone in hospital,\u00a0observe any\u00a0visiting guidelines, avoid taking any children under the age of 12, and wash your hands with liquid soap and water when entering and leaving ward areas \u2013\u00a0don't rely on alcohol hand gels, as they're not effective against C. difficile \n avoid visiting hospital\u00a0if you're feeling unwell or have recently had diarrhoea", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Cirrhosis", "introduction": "Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by continuous, long-term liver damage. \n Scar tissue replaces\u00a0healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly. \n The damage caused by cirrhosis can't be reversed and can eventually become so extensive that your liver stops functioning. This is called liver failure. \n Cirrhosis can be fatal if the liver fails. However, it usually\u00a0takes\u00a0years for\u00a0the condition\u00a0to reach this stage and treatment can help slow its progression. \n Each year in\u00a0the UK, around 4,000 people die from cirrhosis and 700 people with the condition need a\u00a0 liver transplant  to survive. \n Signs and symptoms \n There are usually few symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. However, as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you're likely to experience a loss of appetite, nausea and\u00a0itchy skin. \n In the later stages, symptoms can include jaundice, vomiting blood, dark, tarry-looking stools, and a build-up of fluid in the legs (oedema) and abdomen (ascites). \n  Read more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.  \n When to see your GP \n As cirrhosis doesn't have many obvious symptoms during the early stages, it's often picked up during tests for an unrelated illness. \n See your GP if you have any of the following symptoms: \n \n fever and shivering \n  shortness of breath \u00a0 \n vomiting blood \n very dark or black, tarry stools (faeces) \n periods of confusion or drowsiness \n \n Read more about  diagnosing cirrhosis . \n What causes cirrhosis? \n In\u00a0the UK, the most common causes of cirrhosis are: \n \n drinking too much alcohol ( alcohol misuse ) over many years \n being\u00a0infected with the\u00a0 hepatitis C  virus for a long time \n a\u00a0condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that causes excess fat to build up in the liver \n \n NASH is on the rise in the UK, due to increasing levels of\u00a0 obesity  and reduced physical activity. It's likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis. \n Less common causes of cirrhosis include\u00a0 hepatitis B  infection and inherited liver diseases, such as haemochromatosis. \n Read more about the  causes of cirrhosis . \n Treating cirrhosis \n There's currently no cure for cirrhosis.\u00a0However, it's possible to manage\u00a0the symptoms\u00a0and any complications, and slow\u00a0its progression. \n Treating underlying conditions that may be the cause, such as using anti-viral medication to treat a hepatitis C infection, can also stop cirrhosis getting worse. \n You may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you're overweight.\u00a0A wide\u00a0range of  alcohol support \u00a0services are available. \n In its more advanced stages, the scarring caused by cirrhosis can make your liver stop functioning. In this case, a\u00a0 liver transplant  is the only treatment option. \n Read more about  treating cirrhosis . \n Preventing cirrhosis \n Not\u00a0exceeding\u00a0the recommended limits for alcohol consumption\u00a0is the best way of preventing alcohol-related cirrhosis. \n \n men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week \n spread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week \n \n Read more about  alcohol units . \n Hepatitis B and C are infections you can get by having unprotected sex or sharing needles to inject drugs. Using a  condom  during sex and not injecting  drugs  will reduce your risk of developing hepatitis B and C. \n A vaccine for\u00a0hepatitis B is available, but there's currently no vaccine for hepatitis C. \n Read more about  preventing cirrhosis .", "symptoms": "There are usually few symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis. Noticeable problems tend to develop as the liver becomes more damaged. \n In\u00a0early stage cirrhosis, the liver is able to function properly despite being damaged. As the condition progresses, symptoms tend to develop when functions of the liver are affected. \n Symptoms of cirrhosis\u00a0can include: \n \n tiredness and weakness \n loss of appetite \n weight loss and muscle wasting \n feeling sick\u00a0(nausea) and vomiting \n tenderness or pain around the liver area \n tiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin above waist level \n very itchy skin \n yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent  nosebleeds  or bleeding gums \n hair loss \n fever and shivering attacks \n swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (oedema) \n swelling in your abdomen (tummy), due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites (severe cases\u00a0can make you look heavily pregnant) \n \n You may\u00a0also notice changes in your personality, problems sleeping ( insomnia ), memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as encephalopathy and\u00a0occurs when toxins affect your brain because your liver is unable to remove them from your body. \n Late-stage symptoms \n In the later stages of cirrhosis, you may vomit blood or have tarry, black stools. This is because blood can't flow through the liver properly, which causes an increase in blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the gut to the liver (portal vein). \n The increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools. \n Over time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death. \n When to\u00a0seek medical help \n You should see your GP if you have persistent signs and symptoms of cirrhosis. \n Seek immediate medical help if you develop the following symptoms, particularly if you've been previously diagnosed with cirrhosis: \n \n fever and shivering attacks \n  shortness of breath \u00a0 \n vomiting blood\u00a0 \n very dark or black tarry stools \n periods of mental confusion or drowsiness", "causes": "There are many different causes of cirrhosis. In the UK, the most common causes are drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and long-term hepatitis C infections. \n In\u00a0some cases, no specific cause is identified. \n Alcohol consumption \n The liver breaks down toxins (poisons), such as alcohol, but too much alcohol can scar and damage the liver's cells. Men and women who drink more than 14\u00a0units of alcohol a week are considered to be drinking too much. \n If you're a heavy drinker, your chances of developing cirrhosis are increased. However, it's important to realise that cirrhosis of the liver isn't just a condition that affects people dependent on alcohol. If you're a heavy social drinker, you can also develop cirrhosis. \n Alcohol-related cirrhosis usually develops after 10 or more years of heavy drinking. For unknown reasons, some people are more susceptible to liver cell damage than others. Women who drink heavily are more susceptible to liver damage than men, partly because of their different body size and build. \n Stages of alcoholic liver damage \n People who drink excessively and continue to drink heavily develop cirrhosis in 3\u00a0separate stages. These are described below. \n \n The first stage of\u00a0 alcohol-related liver disease  is known as \"fatty liver\", which almost all excessive drinkers develop. It's a side effect of the liver breaking alcohol down and disappears when you drink less. \n The second stage of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis. Around 20-30% of people who continue to drink heavily develop alcoholic hepatitis. During this stage, the liver becomes inflamed. If alcoholic hepatitis deteriorates into its most extreme form (liver failure) it can lead to death. \n About 10% of heavy drinkers\u00a0develop cirrhosis, which is the third stage of alcohol-related liver disease. \n \n This risk of developing cirrhosis, along with the risk of alcoholic hepatitis, is one of the main reasons the government recommends that men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. If you do drink as much as 14 units a week, it is advised that you spread your drinking over three or more days.\u00a0 \n A unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units.\u00a0 \n Read more about  alcohol units . \n Your GP can give you help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink.\u00a0 \n Hepatitis \n Hepatitis\u00a0is\u00a0inflammation\u00a0of the liver. Left untreated, it can damage the liver over many years, eventually resulting in cirrhosis. \n In\u00a0the UK,  hepatitis C \u00a0is\u00a0the most common form of hepatitis. The hepatitis C\u00a0virus\u00a0is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact,\u00a0most commonly by sharing needles used to inject drugs. \n Two other types of hepatitis infection,\u00a0 hepatitis B  and D, can also cause cirrhosis. \n Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis \n Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe liver condition that can lead to cirrhosis. As with alcohol-related liver disease, the early stage of NASH is the build-up of excess fat in the liver. This fat is associated with inflammation and scarring, which could lead to cirrhosis. \n NASH can develop in people\u00a0who are\u00a0obese, have  diabetes , have\u00a0high levels of fat in the blood ( high cholesterol ) and  high blood pressure . Most people with NASH feel well and aren't aware\u00a0they have a problem until cirrhosis occurs and liver function is affected. \n NASH is on the rise in the UK due to increasing levels of\u00a0 obesity  and reduced physical activity. It's likely that it will overtake alcohol and hepatitis C as the most common cause of cirrhosis. \n Other causes \n There are a number of other conditions that can prevent the liver functioning healthily and can lead to cirrhosis. These include: \n \n autoimmune\u00a0liver disease \u2013 the immune system usually makes antibodies to attack bacteria and viruses; however, if you have an autoimmune disease, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),\u00a0your immune system will make antibodies that attack healthy organs \n some rare, genetic conditions \u2013 such as haemochromatosis (a build-up of iron in the liver and other parts of the body) and Wilson's disease (a build-up of copper in the liver and other parts of the body) \n any condition that causes the bile ducts to become blocked \u2013 such as\u00a0 cancer of the bile ducts  or  pancreatic cancer \u00a0 \n Budd-Chiari syndrome \u2013 caused by blood clots blocking the veins that carry blood from the liver \n \n Less commonly, the use of certain medications, such as amiodarone and methotrexate, can also cause cirrhosis.", "treatment": "Cirrhosis can't be cured, so treatment aims to manage the symptoms and any complications and stop the condition getting worse. \n It's usually not possible to reverse\u00a0liver damage that's already occurred, although recent research suggests this may eventually be possible in cases where the underlying cause of the liver damage can be successfully treated. \n Treatment is likely to take place at a hospital with a specialist hepatology unit, which treats disorders of the liver, gall bladder and biliary ducts. \n Stopping\u00a0cirrhosis getting worse \n Taking medication to treat\u00a0the underlying cause of the liver damage\u00a0and making healthy lifestyle changes can help stop cirrhosis getting worse and reduce your risk of developing further health problems. \n Medication \n The medication you need will depend on the specific cause of the damage to your liver. \n For example, if you have viral\u00a0hepatitis you may be prescribed anti-viral medications. If you have autoimmune hepatitis you may be given steroid medication ( corticosteroids ) or medication to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants). \n Lifestyle changes \n There are a number of things you can do to help yourself stay healthy and reduce your chances of developing further problems if you have cirrhosis, including: \n \n completely avoid  alcohol , regardless of the cause of your cirrhosis, as\u00a0alcohol consumption increases the rate at which the condition progresses \n  lose weight \u00a0if you're overweight or obese \n regular\u00a0 exercise  to\u00a0reduce muscle wasting \n practise\u00a0good hygiene to reduce your chances of developing infections \n speak to your GP about\u00a0 vaccinations  you may need, such as the  annual flu vaccine  or\u00a0travel vaccines \n speak to your GP or pharmacist if\u00a0you're taking over-the-counter or prescription medications, as cirrhosis can affect the way your body processes some medicines \n \n  Malnutrition \u00a0is common in people with cirrhosis, so it's important to ensure you have a\u00a0 balanced diet  to help you get all the nutrients you need. \n Avoiding salty foods and\u00a0not adding salt to foods you eat can help\u00a0reduce your risk of developing swelling in your\u00a0legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build up of fluid. See\u00a0tips for a lower salt diet for more information. \n The damage to your liver can also\u00a0mean it's\u00a0unable to store glycogen,\u00a0a carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you\u00a0may need extra calories and protein in your diet. \n Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein.\u00a0It may also be helpful to eat 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small meals a day, rather than 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0large meals. \n Easing symptoms \n A number of treatments can ease the symptoms of cirrhosis, including: \n \n a low-sodium (salt) diet or\u00a0tablets called diuretics\u00a0to reduce the amount of fluid in your body \n tablets to reduce high blood pressure in your portal vein (the main vein that transports blood from the gut to the liver) and prevent or treat any infection \n creams to reduce itching\u00a0 \n \n Managing complications of advanced cirrhosis \n In cases of advanced cirrhosis, complications caused by the condition may\u00a0need treatment. \n Swollen varices \n If you vomit blood or pass blood in your stools, you probably have swollen veins in your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach). These are known as oesophageal varices. \n In these cases,\u00a0urgent medical attention is required. This means seeing your GP or going to the\u00a0accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department of your nearest hospital immediately. \n Certain procedures can help stop the bleeding and reduce the risk of it happening again, such as: \n \n Banding \u2013 an\u00a0endoscopy is carried out (a thin, flexible tube is passed down your throat) and a small band is placed around the base of the varices to help control the bleeding. \n Injection glue therapy \u2013 following an endoscopy, a type of medical \"super glue\" is injected into the varices to make the blood clot, which helps to stop the bleeding. \n A Sengstaken tube with a balloon on the end \u2013 a special\u00a0tube is passed down your throat into your stomach and the balloon is inflated. This\u00a0puts pressure on the varices and helps stop the bleeding. You'll be heavily sedated during the procedure. \n A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) \u2013 a metal tube called a stent is passed across your liver to join two large veins (the portal vein and hepatic vein). This creates a new route for your blood to flow through, therefore relieving the pressure that causes the varices. \n \n You may also be given a type of medication called a  beta-blocker , such as propanolol, to reduce the risk of bleeding or reduce the severity of any bleed that\u00a0does occur. \n Fluid in the\u00a0tummy and legs \n Ascites (a build-up of fluid around your stomach area) and peripheral oedema (fluid around your legs and ankles) are common complications of advanced cirrhosis. They'll need to be addressed as soon as possible. \n You may have 20 to 30 litres of free water in your stomach area (abdomen), which can make it difficult for you to eat and breathe properly. The main treatments for ascites and oedema are restricting sodium (salt) in your diet and taking diuretic tablets, such as spironolactone or furosemide. \n If the\u00a0fluid around your stomach becomes infected, you may need to be treated with  antibiotics . Alternatively, antibiotics may be used on a regular basis\u00a0to prevent infection in people at high risk. \n In severe cases of ascites, tubes may be used to drain the fluid from your abdomen. This will usually be repeated every few weeks. \n Encephalopathy \n People with cirrhosis can sometimes develop problems with their brain function (encephalopathy). This occurs because the liver isn't clearing toxins properly. \n The main treatment for encephalopathy is lactulose syrup. This acts as a  laxative  (it helps clear the bowels) and helps the body remove the toxins that build up in the body when the liver is failing. In some cases, other laxatives or an enema may be used. \n Bleeding \n Cirrhosis can affect the liver's ability to make the blood clot (thicken), leaving you at risk of severe bleeding if you cut yourself.  Vitamin K  and a blood product called plasma can be given in emergencies to treat episodes of bleeding. You'll need to apply pressure to any cuts that bleed. \n Therefore,\u00a0you should seek specialist advice before having medical procedures, including any dental work. \n Liver transplant \n Your liver may stop functioning if it's severely damaged by scarring. In this situation, a  liver transplant  is the only option. This is a major procedure that involves removing your diseased liver and replacing it with a healthy donor liver. \n However, you'll probably have to wait a long time for a liver transplant because there are more people waiting for a transplant than there are donors. \n The  NHSBT Organ Donation  website has more information about transplants and joining the  Organ Donor Register .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If your GP suspects cirrhosis, they'll check your medical history and carry out a physical examination to look for signs of chronic liver disease. \n If your GP suspects your liver is damaged, you'll be referred for tests to confirm the diagnosis. \n Tests \n You may have a number of different tests including those described below. \n Blood tests \n  Blood tests \u00a0can measure your liver function and the amount of liver damage. A blood test may be used to measure the levels of the liver enzymes alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transferase (AST) in your blood, as these will be raised if you have inflammation of the liver (hepatitis). \n Scans \n An  ultrasound scan ,\u00a0transient elastography scan,  computerised tomography (CT)  scan or a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  scan may be carried out on your liver. A\u00a0transient elastography scan is similar to an ultrasound scan carried out during pregnancy (it's sometimes known as a Fibroscan). \n These scans can produce detailed images of your liver or check liver stiffness to identify any scarring. \n The\u00a0 Lab Tests Online UK \u00a0website has\u00a0more information about\u00a0 ALT  and  AST  measurements. \n Liver\u00a0biopsy \n A liver\u00a0 biopsy \u00a0is where a\u00a0fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs) to remove\u00a0a small sample of liver cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory so it can be examined under a microscope. \n The biopsy is usually carried out under  local anaesthetic , as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. The outcome of the biopsy will confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis and may provide more information about the cause.\u00a0However, transient elastography is increasingly being used as an alternative to a biopsy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. \n Endoscopy \n An\u00a0endoscopy is where an endoscope (a thin, long, flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end) is passed down your throat and into your stomach. \n Images of your oesophagus (tube from your throat to your stomach) and stomach are transmitted to an external screen where any varices (swollen vessels),\u00a0which are a sign of cirrhosis, can be seen. \n Grading \n There are several different grading systems for cirrhosis according to how serious it is. One system is the\u00a0Child-Pugh score which, based on your examination and laboratory tests, grades cirrhosis from A (relatively mild) to C (severe). \n An alternative\u00a0system called\u00a0model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) uses the results of a blood test to help identify\u00a0people who need an urgent liver transplant."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Chronic pancreatitis", "introduction": "Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas (a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage) becomes permanently damaged from inflammation. \n It's different to\u00a0 acute pancreatitis , where the inflammation is only short-term. \n The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal\u00a0(tummy) pain, which can be severe. \n Other symptoms tend to develop as the damage to the pancreas progresses, such as producing greasy, foul-smelling stools. \n Read more about the  symptoms of chronic pancreatitis  and  diagnosing chronic pancreatitis . \n When to seek medical advice \n Always visit your GP if you're experiencing severe pain \u2013 it's a warning sign that something is wrong. \n Why it happens \n Long-term  alcohol misuse  is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas. \n Less common causes include: \n \n smoking \n a problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas \n an inherited\u00a0genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas \n \n In\u00a0as many as\u00a03 out of 10 people with the condition, the cause cannot be identified\u00a0\u2013 this is known as \"idiopathic\" chronic pancreatitis. \n Read more about the  causes of chronic pancreatitis . \n Who's affected \n Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54. \n Between 2012 and 2013, over 35,000 people visited hospitals in England with the condition. \n How it's treated \n In most cases of chronic pancreatitis, there's no specific treatment to reduce the inflammation and repair the damage to the pancreas. \n Treatment mainly focuses on lifestyle changes (see below) and medication to relieve the pain. Surgery is sometimes needed to treat severe chronic pain that doesn't respond to painkillers. \n However, the pain can be difficult to treat and can seriously affect your quality of life. \n People who don't smoke cigarettes and avoid drinking alcohol tend to experience less pain and live longer than those who continue to drink and smoke after receiving a diagnosis. \n Read more about  treating chronic pancreatitis . \n Complications \n  Living with chronic pain \u00a0can cause mental as well as physical strain. It's important to speak to your GP if you're experiencing\u00a0 stress ,  anxiety  or  depression \u00a0caused by chronic pancreatitis. \n  Diabetes  is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and affects about a third of people with the condition. It occurs when the pancreas is damaged and unable to produce insulin. \n People with chronic pancreatitis also have an increased risk of developing  pancreatic cancer . \n Read more about the possible  complications of chronic pancreatitis .", "symptoms": "The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain. Eventually, there may also be digestion problems. \n The pain usually develops in the middle or left side of\u00a0the abdomen and can sometimes travel along your back. It's been described as a burning or shooting pain which comes and goes, but can last for several hours or days, in some cases. \n Some people also experience symptoms of\u00a0 nausea and vomiting  during the pain. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe. \n Although the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there's often no trigger. \n Eventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. \n Some people who\u00a0stop\u00a0 drinking alcohol  and\u00a0 stop smoking \u00a0may experience a reduction in the severity of their pain. \n Advanced chronic pancreatitis \n Additional symptoms can occur when the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food in the digestive system. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the original symptoms started. \n The absence of digestive juices\u00a0makes it difficult for your digestive system to break\u00a0down fats and certain proteins. This can cause your stools to become particularly smelly and greasy, and make them difficult to flush down the toilet. \n You may also experience: \n \n weight loss \n loss of appetite \n jaundice\u00a0(yellowing of the skin and eyes) \n symptoms of  diabetes  \u2013 such as feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently and feeling very tired \n ongoing nausea and vomiting \n \n When to seek medical advice \n Always visit your GP if you're experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong. \n You should also visit your GP if you develop symptoms of jaundice. Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it's usually a sign that there's something wrong with your digestive system. \n You should also visit your GP if you develop persistent vomiting.", "causes": "Most cases of chronic pancreatitis are associated with drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over a long period of time. \n However,\u00a0in up to\u00a03 out of 10 people with the condition,\u00a0the cause\u00a0can't be\u00a0identified \u2013 known as \"idiopathic\" chronic pancreatitis. \n Some of the known causes of chronic pancreatitis are outlined below. \n Alcohol consumption \n Heavy drinking over many years can cause repeated episodes of  acute pancreatitis . Acute pancreatitis is usually a short-term condition, but it can recur if you continue to drink alcohol. \n Over time, repeated inflammation causes permanent damage to the pancreas, resulting in chronic pancreatitis. \n Anyone who regularly consumes alcohol has an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, although only a minority develop the condition. \n Read more about\u00a0 alcohol misuse . \n Problems with the immune system \n Rare cases of chronic pancreatitis are the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the pancreas. This is known as \"autoimmune pancreatitis\" and it's not clear exactly why it happens. \n Many people with autoimmune pancreatitis also have other conditions caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue. These include  ulcerative colitis  or  Crohn\u2019s disease , both of which cause inflammation inside the digestive system. \n Genetics \n Some cases of chronic pancreatitis are inherited. This is thought to be caused by mutations (alterations) in a number of genes, including genes called PRSS1 and SPINK-1. These mutations disrupt the\u00a0normal working of the pancreas. \n Genetic mutations may also have a role in the effect of alcohol on your pancreas. Evidence suggests that certain genetic mutations make\u00a0the pancreas more vulnerable to the harmful effects of alcohol. \n Certain mutations of the CFTR gene, responsible for\u00a0 cystic fibrosis ,\u00a0are also thought to cause chronic pancreatitis in a small amount of cases. \n Other causes \n Several other rare causes of chronic pancreatitis have also been identified, including: \n \n injury to the pancreas \n blocked\u00a0or narrowed\u00a0openings (ducts)\u00a0of the pancreas \n smoking \n  radiotherapy  to the\u00a0abdomen (tummy)", "treatment": "Treatment for chronic pancreatitis aims to help control the condition and reduce any symptoms. \n Lifestyle changes \n If you're diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, some lifestyle changes will be recommended. These are described below. \n Avoiding alcohol \n The most important thing you can do is to stop drinking alcohol, even if\u00a0it isn't the cause of your condition. This helps to\u00a0prevent further damage to your pancreas and may help to reduce the pain. \n If you continue to drink alcohol, it's likely that you'll experience debilitating pain and you'll be more likely to die from a  complication of chronic pancreatitis . \n Some people with chronic pancreatitis caused by alcohol consumption have a dependency on alcohol and require additional help and support to stop drinking. If this applies to you, talk to your GP about getting help to stop drinking. \n Treatment options for alcohol dependence include: \n \n one-to-one\u00a0counselling \n self-help groups \u2013 such as  Alcoholics Anonymous  \n a medication called acamprosate that can help to reduce cravings for alcohol \n \n Read more about\u00a0 treating alcohol misuse . \n Stopping smoking \n If you smoke, you should stop. Smoking can speed up the progress of chronic pancreatitis, making it more likely that your pancreas will lose its function. \n It's recommended that you use an anti-smoking treatment, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion (a medication used to reduce cravings for cigarettes). People who use these types of treatments have a much greater success rate in permanently stopping smoking than those who try to quit using willpower alone. \n If you want to give up smoking, it's a good idea to start by visiting your GP. They'll be able to\u00a0give you\u00a0help and advice about quitting and can refer you to an  NHS Stop Smoking support service . \n These services offer the best support for people who want to give up smoking. Studies show you are 4\u00a0times more likely to give up smoking if you do it through the NHS.\u00a0 \n Read more about\u00a0 stopping smoking . \n Dietary changes \n As chronic pancreatitis\u00a0can affect your ability to digest certain foods, you may need to change your diet. \n Your GP\u00a0may be able to provide you with appropriate dietary advice, or\u00a0may refer you to a dietitian, who will draw up a suitable dietary plan. \n A\u00a0low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin supplements is usually recommended, but don't make changes to your diet without consulting a health professional. \n Enzyme supplements \n You may be given\u00a0pancreatic enzyme supplements, which is medication containing an artificial version of the enzymes produced by your pancreas. These supplements\u00a0may help to improve the effectiveness of your digestive system. \n Side effects of\u00a0pancreatic enzyme supplements can include  diarrhoea ,  constipation , nausea, vomiting and stomach pains. \n Talk to your GP if you're experiencing troublesome side effects, as your dosage may need to be adjusted. \n Steroid medication \n If you have chronic pancreatitis caused by problems with your immune system, treatment is relatively straightforward. The inflammation affecting the pancreas can usually be relieved using steroid medication ( corticosteroids ). \n However, taking corticosteroids for a long time can cause side effects, such as\u00a0 osteoporosis  and weight gain. \n Pain relief \n Pain relief is an important part of the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. At first,\u00a0mild\u00a0painkillers will be used, but more powerful ones will be\u00a0needed\u00a0if these don't work. \n Mild painkillers \n In most cases, the first painkiller used is  paracetamol  or a  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) , such as  ibuprofen . \n Taking NSAIDs on a long-term basis can increase your risk of developing  stomach ulcers , so you may be prescribed an additional medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect against this. \n Stronger painkillers \n If NSAIDs or paracetamol prove to be ineffective in controlling your pain, it's likely that you'll need an opiate-based painkiller, such as codeine or tramadol. Side effects of these types of medication can include constipation, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness. \n The side effect of constipation can be particularly troublesome if you need to take an opiate-based painkiller on a long-term basis. You may be prescribed a laxative to help relieve your constipation. \n See the page on  treating constipation  for more information. \n If you feel drowsy after taking an opiate-based painkiller, avoid driving and using heavy tools or machines. \n Severe pain \n If you experience an attack of very severe pain, you may need a stronger opiate-based painkiller, such as morphine or pethidine. These have similar side effects to the opiate-based painkillers mentioned above. \n Long-term use of these stronger opiate-based painkillers isn't usually recommended, because there's a high risk of addiction. Therefore, if you have persistent severe pain, surgery\u00a0is usually recommended. \n In some cases, an additional medication called amitriptyline may be recommended. Amitriptyline was originally designed to treat depression, but it can help to relieve pain in some people. \n If medication isn't effective, severe pain can sometimes be temporarily relieved for\u00a0a few weeks or\u00a0months using a procedure called\u00a0a nerve block. This is an injection that blocks the pain signals from the pancreas. \n Severe episodes \n If the inflammation of your pancreas suddenly gets worse, you may need a short stay in hospital for treatment. \n This may involve having fluids delivered directly into a vein, and oxygen supplied through tubes into your nose. \n Read more about  treating acute pancreatitis . \n Surgery \n Surgery can be used to treat severe pain in people with chronic pancreatitis. Depending on the exact cause of your pain, there are a variety of surgical techniques that may be used. Some of these are outlined below. \n Endoscopic surgery \n Patients with stones in the opening of their pancreas (the pancreatic duct) may benefit from endoscopic surgery and a treatment called lithotripsy. \n Lithotripsy involves using shock waves to break the stone into smaller pieces. An\u00a0endoscope (a long, thin\u00a0flexible tube with a light source and a video camera at one end) is then used to pass surgical instruments into the pancreatic duct so the pieces can be removed. \n This treatment may improve pain to some extent, but the benefit may not be permanent. \n Pancreas resection \n In cases where specific parts of the pancreas are inflamed and causing severe pain, these parts can be surgically removed. This type of surgery is called a pancreas resection. \n Pancreas resection can also be used if endoscopic treatment is ineffective. \n The\u00a0technique used\u00a0for pancreas resection depends on exactly which parts need to be removed. For example, some techniques involve removing the gallbladder, along with parts of the pancreas. \n The different surgical techniques tend to have the same levels of effectiveness in terms of reducing pain and preserving the function of the pancreas, although\u00a0some of the more complex techniques have an increased risk of complications, such as infection and internal bleeding. Simpler procedures have a lower risk of complications and usually have faster recovery times. \n Discuss the pros and cons of the appropriate pancreas resection techniques with your surgical team before making a decision. \n Total pancreatectomy \n In the most serious cases of chronic pancreatitis, where the pancreas has been extensively damaged, it may be necessary to remove the entire pancreas. This is known as a total pancreatectomy. \n A total pancreatectomy can be very effective in treating pain. However, you'll no longer be able to produce the insulin that's needed by your body. To overcome this problem, a relatively new technique called autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation (APICT) is sometimes used. \n During APICT,\u00a0the islet cells responsible for producing insulin are removed from your pancreas, before your pancreas is surgically removed. \n The\u00a0islet cells are mixed with a special solution, which is injected into your liver. If the APICT procedure is successful, the islet cells remain in your liver and begin to produce insulin. \n In the short term, APICT appears to be effective, but you may need additional insulin treatment in the long term. See guidelines from the\u00a0 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  (NICE) about\u00a0 autologous pancreatic islet cell transplantation  for more information.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Chronic pancreatitis can usually only be diagnosed by carrying out scans of the pancreas. \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a simple physical examination, but they'll refer you for further tests if they suspect chronic pancreatitis. \n These\u00a0tests are usually carried out\u00a0in\u00a0your local hospital and\u00a0may include: \n \n requesting a stool sample \n an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  \u2013 where sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your pancreas \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \u2013 where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of the pancreas \n an endoscopic ultrasonography\u00a0(see below) \n a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or MRCP (see below) \n \n Endoscopic ultrasonography \n During an endoscopic ultrasonography, a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. An ultrasound probe attached to the tip of the\u00a0endoscope is able to get close to the pancreas and take very accurate pictures of it. \n You'll usually be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure. \n MRCP \n An MRCP involves injecting you with a substance known as a contrast agent that\u00a0makes your pancreas and surrounding organs, such as the gallbladder and liver, show up very clearly on a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner . \n An\u00a0MRI scanner is a type of imaging system that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to build up a detailed image of the inside of your body. \n An MRCP is a useful way of checking whether  gallstones  may be contributing to your symptoms. \n Biopsy \n Sometimes, the symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can be very similar to  pancreatic cancer . Therefore, if you have symptoms such as\u00a0jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\u00a0and weight loss, a biopsy may be recommended to rule out a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. \n A\u00a0 biopsy  involves taking a small sample of cells from the pancreas and sending it to a laboratory, so it can be checked under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells. \n A biopsy can be taken using a long, thin needle that's passed through your abdomen. The needle can be guided towards the tumour using an ultrasound scan or CT scan. Alternatively, a biopsy can be taken during an endoscopic ultrasonography (see above)."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "introduction": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease. \n People with COPD\u00a0have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways, this is called airflow obstruction. \n Typical symptoms of COPD include: \n \n increasing breathlessness when active \n a persistent cough with phlegm \n frequent chest infections \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  \n Why does COPD happen? \n The main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring. \n Over many years, the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung. The walls of the airways thicken and more mucus is produced. Damage to the delicate walls of the air sacs in the lungs causes emphysema and the lungs lose their normal elasticity. The smaller airways also become scarred and narrowed.\u00a0These changes cause the symptoms of breathlessness, cough and phlegm associated with COPD. \n Some cases of COPD are caused by fumes, dust, air pollution and genetic disorders, but these are rarer. \n Read more about the  causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  \n Who is affected? \n COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually only starts to affect people over the age of\u00a035, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s. \n It is thought there are more than 3 million people living with the disease in the UK, of which only about 900,000 have been diagnosed. This is because many people who develop symptoms of COPD do not\u00a0get medical help because they often dismiss their symptoms as a \u2018smoker\u2019s cough\u2019. \n COPD affects more men than women, although\u00a0rates in women\u00a0are increasing. \n Diagnosis \n It is important that COPD is diagnosed as early as possible so\u00a0treatment can be used to try to slow down the deterioration of your lungs. You should see your GP if you have any of the symptoms mentioned above. \n COPD is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your doctor, which may be followed by breathing tests. \n Read more about  diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  \n Treating\u00a0COPD \n Although the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this. \n Treatments for COPD usually involve relieving the symptoms with medication, for example by using an inhaler to make breathing easier. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also help increase the amount of\u00a0exercise you are capable of doing. \n Surgery is only an option for a small number of people with COPD. \n Read more about  treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  \n Living with COPD \n COPD can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact. \n Simple steps such as living in a healthy way, being as active as possible,\u00a0learning breathing techniques, and taking your medication can help you to reduce the symptoms of COPD. \n Financial support and advice about relationships and end of life care\u00a0is also available for people with COPD. \n Read more about  living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . \n Want to know more? \n \n British Lung Foundation:\u00a0 COPD  \n \n Can COPD be prevented? \n Although COPD causes about 25,000 deaths a year in the UK, severe COPD can usually\u00a0be prevented by making changes to your lifestyle. \n If you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition. \n Research has shown you are up to four times more likely to succeed in giving up smoking if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this, phone Quit Your Way Scotland on 0800 84 84 84\u00a0or\u00a0read more about  stopping smoking . \n Also avoid exposure to tobacco smoke as much as possible.", "symptoms": "Symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually develop over a number of years, so you may not be aware you have the condition. \n COPD does not usually become noticeable until after the age of 35 and most people diagnosed with the condition are over 50 years old. \n See your GP if you have the following symptoms: \n \n increasing\u00a0breathlessness when exercising or moving around \n a persistent cough with phlegm that never seems to go away \n frequent\u00a0 chest infections , particularly in winter \n wheezing \n \n Middle-aged smokers and ex-smokers who have a persistent chesty cough (especially in the morning), breathlessness on slight exertion or persistent coughs and colds in the winter should see their GP or practice nurse for a simple breathing test. \n If you have COPD, the airways of the lungs become inflamed and narrowed. As the air sacs get permanently damaged, it will become increasingly difficult to breathe out. \n While there is currently no cure for COPD, the sooner the condition is diagnosed and appropriate treatment begins, the less chance there is of severe lung damage. \n Read more about  treating COPD . \n Flare-ups \n Symptoms of COPD are often worse in\u00a0winter, and it is common to have two or more flare-ups a year. A flare-up (also known as an exacerbation) is when your symptoms are particularly bad.\u00a0This is one of the most common reasons for people being admitted to hospital in the UK. \n Other signs of COPD \n Other signs of COPD can include: \n \n weight loss \n tiredness and fatigue \n swollen ankles \n \n Chest pain\u00a0and\u00a0coughing up blood (haemoptysis) are not common symptoms of COPD. They are usually caused by other conditions such as a\u00a0 chest infection  or, less commonly,  lung cancer .", "causes": "There are several things that may increase your risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), many of which can be avoided. \n Things you can change \n You can reduce your risk of developing COPD by\u00a0not smoking and avoiding\u00a0exposure to certain substances at work. \n Smoking \n Smoking is the\u00a0main cause of COPD and is thought to\u00a0be responsible for\u00a0around 90% of cases. The lining of the airways becomes inflamed and permanently damaged by smoking and this damage cannot be reversed. \n Up to 25% of smokers develop COPD. \n Passive smoking \n Exposure to other people\u2019s smoke increases the risk of COPD. \n Fumes and dust \n Exposure to certain types of dust and chemicals at work, including grains, isocyanates, cadmium and coal, has been linked to the development of COPD, even in people who do not smoke.\u00a0 \n The risk of COPD is even higher if you breathe in dust or fumes in the workplace and you smoke. \n Air pollution \n According to some research, air pollution may be an additional risk factor for COPD. However, at the moment it is not\u00a0conclusive and research is continuing. \n Want to know more? \n \n  stopping smoking  \n  treatments to help you stop smoking  \n Health and Safety Executive:  COPD  \n \n Things you cannot change \n There are a few factors for COPD\u00a0that you cannot change. \n Having a brother or sister with severe COPD \n A research study has shown that smokers who have brothers and sisters with severe COPD are at greater risk of developing the condition than smokers who do not. \n Having a genetic tendency to COPD \n There is a rare genetic tendency to develop COPD called alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. This causes COPD in a small number of people (about 1%). Alpha-1-antitrypsin is a protein that protects your lungs. Without it, the lungs can be damaged by other enzymes that occur naturally in the body. \n People who have an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency usually develop COPD at a younger age, often under 35. \n Want to know more? \n \n British Lung Foundation:  Alpha-1-antitrypsin  \n  Alpha1 Awareness UK", "treatment": "Stop smoking \n  Stopping smoking \u00a0is the\u00a0most effective\u00a0way for people with COPD to help themselves feel better and is the only proven way to reduce the rate of decline in lung function. \n Stopping smoking at an early stage of the disease makes a huge difference. Any damage already done to the airways cannot be reversed, but giving up smoking can slow the rate at which the condition worsens. \n If COPD is in the early stages and symptoms are mild, no other treatments may be needed. However, it is never too late to stop smoking. Even people with fairly advanced COPD are likely to benefit from quitting, which may prevent further damage to the airways. \n Research has shown\u00a0you are up to four times more likely to give up smoking successfully if you use NHS support along with stop-smoking medicines such as tablets, patches or gum. Ask your doctor about this. \n Read more about  stopping smoking . \n Inhalers \n If an inhaler is prescribed for you, your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist can explain how to use it. They will check you are using it properly. \n Most people learn to use an inhaler successfully, but if you are having problems, a spacer or a\u00a0different type of inhaler device may help you take your medicines correctly. A spacer is a device that increases the amount of medication that reaches the lungs. \n Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers \n Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers deliver a small dose of medicine directly to your lungs, causing the muscles in your airways to relax and open up. \n There are two types of short-acting bronchodilator inhaler: \n \n beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salbutamol and terbutaline \n antimuscarinic inhalers, such as ipratropium \n \n The inhaler should be used when you feel breathless and this should relieve the symptoms. \n Long-acting bronchodilator inhalers \n If a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler does not help relieve your symptoms, your GP may recommend a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler. This works in a similar way to a short-acting bronchodilator, but each dose lasts for at least 12 hours. \n There are two types of long-acting bronchodilator inhalers: \n \n beta-2 agonist inhalers, such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol\u00a0 \n antimuscarinic inhalers, such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidinium \n \n Steroid inhalers \n Steroid inhalers, also called corticosteroid inhalers, work by reducing the inflammation in your airways. \n If you are still getting breathless or having flare-ups even when taking long-acting bronchodilator inhalers, your GP may suggest including a steroid inhaler as part of your treatment. Most people with COPD will be prescribed a steroid inhaler as part of a combination inhaler. \n Medicines \n Theophylline tablets \n If you are getting breathless or having flare-ups when using a combination of inhalers, your GP may prescribe theophylline tablets. Theophylline causes the muscles of your airways to relax and open up. \n When you have been taking theophylline tablets regularly, you\u00a0may need to give a blood sample to measure the amount of theophylline in your blood and help your GP prescribe the appropriate dose of tablet. This will allow you to get the correct dose of theophylline while reducing the likelihood of side effects. \n Due to the risk of potential side effects, such as increased heart rate and headaches, other medicines, such as a bronchodilator inhaler, are usually tried before theophylline. \n Mucolytic tablets or capsules \n Mucolytics, such as carbocisteine, make the mucus and phlegm in your throat thinner and easier to cough up. They are particularly beneficial for people with a persistent cough with lots of thick phlegm or who have frequent or bad flare-ups. \n Antibiotics and steroid tablets \n If you have a chest infection, your GP may prescribe a short course of  antibiotics . \n Steroid tablets may also be prescribed as a short course if you have a bad flare-up. They work best if they are taken as the flare-up starts, so your GP may give you a course to keep at home. Occasionally, you may have to take a longer course of steroid tablets. Your GP will give you the lowest effective dose and monitor you for side effects. Side effects are uncommon if steroid tablets are given for less than three weeks. \n Read more about the medicines used in\u00a0the  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medicines guide . \n Other types of treatment \n Nebulised medication \n Nebulised medication\u00a0can be used for severe cases of COPD if other inhaler devices have not worked effectively. A compressor is a machine that administers nebulised medicine through a mouthpiece or a face mask. The medicine is in a liquid form and is converted into a fine mist. This enables a large dose of medicine to be taken in one go. \n You can usually choose whether to use nebulised medication\u00a0with a mouthpiece or a facemask. Your GP will advise you on\u00a0how to use the machine correctly. \n Long-term oxygen therapy \n If the oxygen level in your blood is low, you may\u00a0be advised to have oxygen at home through nasal tubes, also called a nasal cannula, or through a mask. Oxygen is not a treatment for breathlessness, but it is helpful for some patients with persistently low oxygen levels in the blood. \n You will probably be referred for more detailed assessment to see whether you might benefit from long-term oxygen therapy. \n If you are prescribed long term oxygen therapy, it must be taken for at least 15 hours a day to be effective. However, the longer you use it, the more effective it is. \n The tubes from the machine are long so you will be able to move around your home while you are connected. Portable oxygen tanks are available if you need to use oxygen away from home. \n The aim of long-term oxygen therapy is to extend your life. \n Do not smoke when you are using oxygen. The increased level of oxygen\u00a0produced is highly flammable, and a lit cigarette could trigger a fire or explosion. \n Ambulatory oxygen therapy \n Part of the oxygen assessment is likely to consider if you may benefit from ambulatory oxygen \u2013 oxygen used when you walk or are active in other ways. \n If your oxygen levels are normal while you are resting, but fall when you exercise, you may not need long-term oxygen therapy alongside ambulatory oxygen therapy. \n Read more about\u00a0 home oxygen treatment . \n Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) \n Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) helps a person breathe using a portable machine connected to a mask covering the nose or face. You may receive it if you are taken to hospital because of a flare-up. You may be referred to a specialist centre to see if\u00a0home NIV could help you.\u00a0NIV is used to improve the functioning of your lungs. \n Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes \n Pulmonary rehabilitation is a programme of exercise and education designed to help people with chronic lung problems. It can increase your exercise capacity, mobility and self-confidence. \n Pulmonary rehabilitation is based on a programme of physical exercise training tailored to your needs. It usually\u00a0involves walking or cycling, and\u00a0arm and strength-building exercises. It also includes education about\u00a0your disease for\u00a0you and\u00a0your family, dietary assessment and advice, and psychological, social and behavioural changes designed to help\u00a0you cope better. \n A rehabilitation programme is provided by a multidisciplinary team, which\u00a0includes physiotherapists, respiratory nurse specialists and dietitians. \n Pulmonary rehabilitation takes place in a group and the course usually lasts for about six weeks. During the course, you will learn more about your COPD and how to control your symptoms. \n Pulmonary rehabilitation can greatly improve your quality of life.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is usually diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, as well as breathing tests. \n If you are concerned about the health of your lungs and have symptoms that could be COPD, see your GP as soon as you can. \n Being diagnosed early means you will receive appropriate treatment, advice and help to stop or slow the progression of COPD. \n At a consultation, your doctor will ask\u00a0about your symptoms, how long you have had them, and whether you smoke, or used to smoke. They will examine you and listen to your chest using a stethoscope. You may also be weighed and measured to calculate your body mass index (BMI). \n Your doctor will also check how well your lungs are working with a lung function test called spirometery. \n Spirometry \n To assess how well your lungs work, a breathing test called\u00a0spirometry is carried out. You will be asked to breathe into a machine called a spirometer. \n The spirometer takes two measurements: the volume of air you can breathe out in one second (called the forced expiratory volume in one second or FEV 1 ) and the total amount of air you breathe out (called the forced vital capacity or FVC). \n You may be asked to breathe out a few times to get a consistent reading. \n The readings are compared with normal measurements for your age, which can show if your airways are obstructed. \n Other tests \n You\u00a0may have other tests as well as spirometry. Often, these other tests will help the doctor rule out other conditions\u00a0that cause similar symptoms. \n Chest X-ray \n A chest\u00a0 X-ray \u00a0will show whether you have another lung condition\u00a0which may be causing symptoms, such as a\u00a0 chest infection  or\u00a0lung cancer. \n Blood test \n A\u00a0 blood test  will show whether your symptoms could be due to  anaemia , as this can also cause breathlessness. \n Further tests \n Some people may need more tests. The tests may confirm the diagnosis or indicate the severity of your COPD. This will help you and your doctor plan your treatment. \n Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram \n An electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram may be used to check the condition of your heart. \n An ECG involves attaching electrodes (sticky metal patches) to your arms, legs and chest to pick up the electrical signals from your heart. \n An echocardiogram uses sound waves to build a detailed picture of your heart. This is similar to an  ultrasound scan . \n Peak flow test \n To confirm\u00a0you have\u00a0COPD and not asthma, you may be\u00a0asked to take regular measurements of your breathing using a peak flow meter, at different times over several days. The peak flow meter measures how fast you can breathe out. \n Blood oxygen level \n The level of oxygen in your blood is measured using a pulse oximeter, which looks like a peg and is\u00a0attached to the finger. If you have low levels of oxygen, you may need an assessment to see whether extra oxygen would help you. \n Blood test for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency \n If the condition runs in your family or you developed the symptoms of COPD under the age of\u00a035 and have never smoked, you will probably have a blood test to see if you are alpha-1-antitrypsin deficient. \n Computerised tomography (CT) scan \n Some people may need a  CT scan . This provides more information than an X-ray and can be useful in diagnosing other lung diseases or assessing changes to your lungs due to COPD. \n Other breathing tests \n If your symptoms seem worse than would be expected from your spirometry results, your doctor may decide you need more detailed lung function tests. You may be referred to a hospital specialist for these tests. \n Phlegm sample \n The doctor may take a sample of phlegm (sputum) to check whether it has been infected."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia", "introduction": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. Chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer. There are two main types: \n \n lymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections \n myeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage \n \n These pages focus on chronic myeloid leukaemia, which is a cancer of the myeloid cells. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere: \n \n  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  \n  acute myeloid leukaemia  \n  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \n \n What happens in chronic leukaemia \n Your bone marrow produces stem cells. These are unique cells because they have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cell: \n \n red blood cells \u2013 which carry oxygen around the body \n white blood cells \u2013 which help fight infection \n platelets \u2013 which help stop bleeding \n \n In leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets. \n It's this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding. \n Warning signs of chronic myeloid leukaemia \n In its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms. As the condition develops, symptoms include: \n \n tiredness\u00a0 \n weight loss\u00a0 \n night sweats \n a feeling of bloating \n bruising\u00a0 \n bone pain\u00a0 \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia  \n How common is chronic myeloid leukaemia? \n Chronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer. Around 8,600 people are diagnosed with leukaemia every year in the UK. In 2011, around 680 people in the UK were diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. \n Chronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40-60. There is no evidence that it runs in families. \n Outlook \n The outlook for chronic myeloid leukaemia depends to a large extent on how well a person responds to medication. \n Most patients (60-65%) do well on imatinib tablets, which are taken every day for life. \n For those who\u00a0don't do well on imatinib, more than half respond to one of the alternative drugs. Nilotinib is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who are not responding to, or can't tolerate imantinib. \n Those who fail these drugs or cannot tolerate them may be offered a  bone marrow transplant , if this is a suitable treatment. \n Read more about the  treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia  \n If the condition is diagnosed early (the chronic phase), the outlook is excellent, with almost 90% of people living at least five years after diagnosis.", "symptoms": "In its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition. \n When symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include: \n \n tiredness \n frequent infections \n unexplained weight loss \n a feeling of bloating \n less commonly, swollen lymph nodes \u2013 glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless \n \n Chronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). This can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. A swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion. \n The symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. They include: \n \n severe fatigue \n bone pain \n night sweats \n fever \n easily bruised skin", "causes": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells which produce white blood cells. \n The change in the DNA causes the\u00a0stem cells to\u00a0produce more white blood cells than are needed. \n They are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature\u00a0and able to fight infection like healthy 'adult' white blood cells. \n As the number of immature cells increases,\u00a0the number of\u00a0healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it's this\u00a0fall\u00a0which causes many of the\u00a0symptoms of chronic leukaemia. \n Philadelphia chromosome \n Although the cause of chronic myeloid leukaemia is genetic, it is not inherited as it is an acquired genetic abnormality. \n Most people with the condition have an abnormal chromosome, where a section of DNA from one chromosome\u00a0has been swapped with a section from another. \n This is called the\u00a0Philadelphia chromosome and it makes the cell produce a protein that encourages the leukaemic cells to resist normal cell death and\u00a0grow and multiply far more quickly than usual. \n Possible triggers for chronic leukaemia \n What triggers the development of chronic leukaemia and causes the initial mutation in stem cells is unknown. The one proven risk factor is exposure to radiation. \n However, radiation is only a significant risk if the levels are extremely high, such as those recorded after an atomic bomb explodes, or those released after a nuclear reactor accident, such as the one at Chernobyl. \n Benzene \n There is limited evidence that prolonged exposure to the chemical benzene leads to an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry, but in the UK\u00a0there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure. \n Benzene is also found in cigarettes. However, it is thought that smoking is more of a risk factor in  acute leukaemia  than it is in chronic leukaemia. \n Occupational risks \n A number of occupations have been linked to an increased risk of chronic leukaemia, possibly due to exposure to certain substances such as pesticides or chemicals. \n These occupations include: \n \n all types of agricultural workers \n people who are involved with rubber or plastic manufacture \n tailors and dressmakers \n cleaners \n builder\u2019s labourer \n \n Other risk factors \n There is some evidence to show an increased risk of chronic leukaemia in people who: \n \n are  obese  \n have a weakened immune system \u2013 due to  HIV or AIDS  or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant \n have inflammatory bowel disease \u2013 such as  ulcerative colitis  or  Crohn's disease", "treatment": "Imatinib tablets are usually given as soon as you have been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia, to slow its progression. These tablets are taken every day for life, and most patients do really well on them. \n The aim of treatment is to achieve the following: \n \n by three months, correct the blood count \n by 12 months, clear the bone marrow of cells containing the Philadelphia chromosome (see\u00a0 Causes  page for information on this) \n by 18 months, get to a stage where\u00a0the leukaemia can only be detected by a very sensitive molecular test (molecular remission) \n \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0is usually offered if the cancer reaches an advanced stage. \n These treatments are explained below. \n Treating early-stage chronic myeloid leukaemia \n Imatinib \n A medicine called imatinib is the main treatment recommended for chronic myeloid leukaemia. It is usually given as soon as a diagnosis is made because the medicine is designed to slow the progression of the cancer and to\u00a0prevent the condition reaching the accelerated or advanced phase. \n Imatinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This means it blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase\u00a0(tyrosine kinase\u00a0helps to stimulate the growth of cancer cells). This reduces the production of abnormal white blood cells. \n Imatinib is taken as a tablet. The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve with time. They include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n swelling in the face and lower legs \n muscle cramps \n rash \n diarrhoea \n \n Nilotinib \n It is estimated that 10-40% of people who take imatinib become resistant to its effects, so an alternative treatment is required. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended nilotinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia that is resistant or intolerant to imantinib. In some cases, nilotinib is recommended\u00a0as the first treatment. \n Nilotinib\u00a0works in a similar way to imatinib in that it blocks the effects of proteins that help stimulate the growth of cancer cells. \n Side effects of nilotinib can include: \n \n vomiting \n abdominal pain \n bone and joint pain \n dry skin \n loss of appetite \n hair loss \n insomnia \n night sweats \n dizziness \n tingling or numbness \n \n If the\u00a0side effects become particularly troublesome, temporarily stopping the treatment usually helps to bring them under control. Treatment can then be resumed, possibly using a lower dose of medication. \n Read about the  complications of chronic myeloid leukaemia  for more information and advice about being vulnerable to infection and bleeding. \n Treating advanced chronic myeloid leukaemia \n Chemotherapy \n Once chronic myeloid leukaemia has progressed to\u00a0a more advanced stage, chemotherapy is the next treatment. \n Chemotherapy tablets are usually used first because they have fewer and milder side effects than chemotherapy injections. Side effects include: \n \n tiredness \n skin rash \n increased vulnerability to infection \n \n Chemotherapy can weaken your immune system, which helps protect you against infection. This is known as being immunocompromised. \n See  chronic leukaemia complications \u00a0for more information about this \n If your symptoms persist or get worse, chemotherapy injections (intravenous chemotherapy) will need to be used. Intravenous chemotherapy causes more side effects than chemotherapy tablets and they tend to be more severe. \n Side effects include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n tiredness \n hair loss \n infertility \n \n These side effects should resolve after your treatment has finished, although there is a risk that infertility could be permanent. \n Bone marrow and stem cell transplants \n A bone marrow transplant can offer a cure for\u00a0chronic leukaemia, although it is only suitable and necessary\u00a0for\u00a0some patients. \n Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant has to have aggressive, high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body. \n This can put enormous strain on the body and can cause significant side effects and potential complications. Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person who is receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type. \n Due to these issues, transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people in good health, and there is a suitable brother or sister who can provide a donation. \n In most cases of chronic leukaemia, the potential risks of transplantation far outweigh any benefit. For example, the chances of an elderly person with advanced chronic leukaemia surviving a bone marrow transplant can be as low as\u00a0one in five. \n However, your specific circumstances may mean that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks. \n Read more about  bone marrow transplants", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia is often first detected when a routine blood test is carried out to diagnose another, unrelated, condition. \n A\u00a0 blood test \u00a0that reveals abnormally high levels of white blood cells could be a sign of chronic leukaemia. If you have a blood test with abnormal results, you will be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further testing. \n Bone marrow biopsy \n To confirm a diagnosis of chronic leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow  biopsy . A bone marrow biopsy is usually carried out under a  local anaesthetic . \n The haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a needle to remove the bone marrow sample.\u00a0You\u00a0may experience some pain\u00a0once the anaesthetic wears off and\u00a0some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you should not have to stay in hospital overnight. \n The bone marrow sample will be checked to see if there are cancerous cells. If\u00a0there are, the biopsy will also be able to help determine which type of chronic leukaemia is present. \n Further tests \n There are a number of additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. These can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. These are outlined below. \n Cytogenetic testing \n Cytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are a number of specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment. \n For example, 90% of people with chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome. People who have this\u00a0chromosome are known to respond well to a medicine called imatinib. \n Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \n A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test\u00a0can be\u00a0done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment. \n The blood test is repeated every three months for at least two years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved. \n Imaging tests \n In some cases, the hospital may want to perform some imaging tests to help rule out other conditions or confirm a diagnosis. This may be either: \n \n an\u00a0 X-ray  \u2013 usually to examine your chest \n an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  \u2013 usually to examine your spleen and liver"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Chronic kidney disease", "introduction": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively. \n CKD does not usually cause symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage. It is usually detected at earlier stages by blood and urine tests. Main symptoms of advanced kidney disease include: \n \n tiredness \n swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention) \n shortness of breath \n nausea \n blood in the urine \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of chronic kidney disease  \n Chronic kidney disease is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests. \n If you are at a high risk of developing CKD, you may be screened annually. Screening may be recommended if you have: \n \n  high blood pressure \u00a0(hypertension) \n  diabetes  \n a family history of CKD \n \n Read more about  diagnosing chronic kidney disease  \n Why does it happen? \n The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist,\u00a0located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine. The kidneys also: \n \n help maintain blood pressure\u00a0 \n maintain the correct levels of chemicals in your body which, in turn, will help\u00a0heart and muscles function properly \n produce the active form of vitamin D that keeps bones healthy\u00a0 \n produce a substance called erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells \n \n Chronic kidney disease is the reduced ability of the kidney to carry out these functions in the long-term. This is most often caused by damage to the kidneys from other conditions, most commonly diabetes and high blood pressure. \n Read more about the  causes of chronic kidney disease  \n Who is affected? \n CKD is common and\u00a0mainly associated with ageing. The older you get, the more likely you are to have some degree of kidney disease. \n It is estimated that about one in five men and one in four women between the ages of 65 and 74 has some degree of CKD. \n CKD is more common in people of south Asian origin (those from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) and black people than the general population. The reasons for this include higher rates of diabetes in south Asian\u00a0people and higher rates of high blood pressure in African or Caribbean people. \n Treating chronic kidney disease \n There is no cure for chronic kidney disease, although treatment can slow or halt the progression of the disease and can prevent other serious conditions developing. \n People with CKD are known to have an increased risk of a heart attack because of changes that occur to the circulation. \n In\u00a0a\u00a0minority of people, CKD may cause kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (ERF) or end-stage kidney disease. In this situation, the usual functions of the kidney stop working. \n To survive, people with ERF may need to have artificial kidney treatment, called  dialysis , or a kidney transplant. \n Read more about  treating chronic kidney disease  \n Being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease can be worrying, but support and advice are available to help you cope. \n Read more about  living with chronic kidney disease  \n Preventing chronic kidney disease \n The main way to reduce the chances of CKD developing is to ensure any existing conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, are carefully managed. \n Some lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of CKD developing, these include: \n \n having a healthy diet \n avoiding drinking excessive amounts of alcohol \n exercising regularly \n avoiding medicines that can damage the kidney \n \n Read more about  preventing chronic kidney disease  \n Want to know more? \n \n NKF:\u00a0 About the kidneys  \n Kidney Research UK:  Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  \n  British Kidney Patient Association", "symptoms": "Most people with CKD have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function. \n In other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. Kidney function is often sufficient if only one kidney is working. That is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant. \n A change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. If you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine\u00a0tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum. \n If the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney failure (established renal failure or ERF), this will usually be tracked by blood tests and monitoring. If kidney failure does occur, the symptoms may include: \n \n weight loss and poor appetite \n swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention)\u00a0 \n shortness of breath\u00a0 \n blood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test)\u00a0 \n an increased need to urinate, particularly at night\u00a0 \n insomnia \n itchy skin\u00a0 \n muscle cramps \n  high blood pressure  (hypertension) \n nausea\u00a0 \n erectile dysfunction in men\u00a0(an inability to get or maintain an erection) \n \n These are general symptoms and can be caused by many less serious conditions. Many of the symptoms\u00a0above can be avoided if treatment begins at an early stage, before any symptoms appear. \n If you are worried by any of the symptoms above, arrange to see your GP. \n Want to know more? \n \n National Kidney Federation:  Symptoms and Problems", "causes": "Kidney disease is most often caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. \n  High blood pressure  (hypertension) and  diabetes  are the most common causes of kidney disease. The evidence indicates that high blood pressure causes just over a quarter of all cases of kidney failure. Diabetes has been established as the cause of around a quarter of all cases. \n High blood pressure \n Blood pressure is a measure of the pressure your heart generates in your arteries with each pulse. Too much pressure can damage your body's organs, leading to heart disease, stroke and worsening of kidney function. \n The cause of around 90% of cases of high blood pressure is unknown, although there appears to be a link between the condition and a person\u2019s general health, diet, and lifestyle. \n Known risk factors for high blood pressure include: \n \n age (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases as you get older)\u00a0 \n family history of high blood pressure (the condition seems to run in families)\u00a0 \n being of African-Caribbean or south Asian origin\u00a0 \n obesity\u00a0 \n lack of exercise\u00a0 \n smoking \n excessive alcohol consumption\u00a0 \n high amount of salt in your diet \n high-fat diet\u00a0 \n stress \n \n Hypertension causes damage by putting strain on the small blood vessels in the kidneys. This prevents the filtering process from working properly. \n Diabetes \n Diabetes is a condition in which the body produces no \u2013 or too little \u2013 insulin ( type 1 diabetes ) or has become unable to make effective use of insulin ( type 2 diabetes ). \n Insulin is needed to regulate\u00a0levels of glucose (sugar) in your blood, preventing the levels going too high after a meal and too low between meals. \n If diabetes is poorly controlled, too much glucose can build up in your blood. The glucose can damage the tiny filters in the kidneys, which affects the ability of your kidneys to filter out waste products and fluids. \n It is estimated that 20-40% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop kidney disease before they reach 50 years of age. Around 30% of people with type 2 diabetes also show signs of developing kidney damage. \n The first sign of diabetic kidney disease is the appearance of low levels of protein in the urine. Therefore, your GP will ask for an annual urine test so any kidney disease can be detected as early as possible. \n All people with diabetes should have a kidney check every year. Early detection of kidney dysfunction in diabetes is important because it identifies people at risk or complications, such as eye problems and impotence. \n Other causes \n There are many other conditions that less commonly cause CKD, including: \n \n glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney)\u00a0 \n pyelonephritis (infection in the kidney)\u00a0 \n polycystic kidney disease (an inherited condition where both kidneys are larger than normal due to the gradual growth of masses of cysts)\u00a0 \n failure of normal kidney development in an unborn baby while developing in the womb \n systemic lupus erythematosus (a condition of the immune system where the body attacks the kidney as if it were foreign tissue) \n long-term, regular use of medicines, such as lithium and  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , including aspirin and ibuprofen\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n blockages, for example due to  kidney stones  or prostate disease", "treatment": "Lifestyle changes \n The following lifestyle changes are known to help reduce your blood pressure and help control CKD: \n \n stopping smoking \n eating a healthy, low-fat, balanced diet\u00a0 \n restricting your salt intake to less than 6g (0.2oz) a day \n not\u00a0using over-the-counter  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen, except when advised to by a medical professional \n moderating your alcohol intake\u00a0so it is within recommended limits (no more than 3-4 units a day for men and 2-3 units a day for women)\u00a0 \n losing weight if you are overweight or obese\u00a0 \n doing regular exercise\u00a0for at least 30 minutes a day, five times a week \n \n Read\u00a0more about  preventing high blood pressure \u00a0through lifestyle changes. \n Medications for high blood pressure \n One of the main ways to reduce the progression of kidney damage is to  manage high blood pressure . Good control of blood pressure is\u00a0vital to protect the kidneys. \n People with CKD should aim to get their blood pressure down to below 140/90mmHg but if you also have diabetes you should aim to get it down to below 130/80mmHg. \n There are many types of blood pressure drugs.\u00a0Medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used to control high blood pressure in people with CKD. \n As well as reducing blood pressure around the body and reducing the strain on blood vessels,\u00a0ACE inhibitors\u00a0give additional protection to the kidney. \n ACE inhibitors include: \n \n ramipril\u00a0 \n enalapril\u00a0 \n lisinopril\u00a0 \n perindopril \n \n Side effects of ACE inhibitors include: \n \n a persistent, dry cough\u00a0 \n dizziness\u00a0 \n tiredness or weakness\u00a0 \n headaches \n \n Most of these side effects should pass within a few days, although some people continue to have a dry cough. \n If the side effects of ACE inhibitors are particularly troublesome, you can be given an alternative medication called an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB).\u00a0This group of medicines includes: \n \n candesartan \n eprosartan \n irbesartan \n azilsartan \n olmesartan \n temisartan \n valsartan \n losartan \n \n The side effects of ARBs are uncommon, but can include dizziness. \n Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs can cause a reduction in kidney function in some people\u00a0and increased levels of potassium in the blood, so blood tests will need to be performed after you start treatment and whenever the dose changes. If you are on an ACE inhibitor or ARB and you develop a fever/infection or need medicines for other conditions, it's important to ask your doctor if the ACE inhibitor or ARB needs to be temporarily stopped. \n Medication to reduce cholesterol \n Studies have shown that people with CKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes. This is because some of the risk factors for CKD are the same as those for heart attacks and strokes, including high blood pressure and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (atherosclerosis). \n Statins are a type of medication used to lower cholesterol levels. Cholesterol causes narrowing of the arteries that can lead to a blockage of the blood supply to the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain (causing a stroke). Statins work by blocking the effects of an enzyme in your liver (called HMG-CoA reductase), which is used to make cholesterol. \n Statins sometimes have mild side effects, including: \n \n constipation \n diarrhoea\u00a0 \n headaches\u00a0 \n abdominal pain \n \n Occasionally, statins can cause muscle pain, weakness and tenderness. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact your GP. You\u00a0may need to have a blood test or change your treatment. \n If you have kidney disease, you may be asked to reduce your daily fluid and salt intake. You may develop a build-up of fluid as your kidneys will not be able to get rid of fluid as well as they did before. \n If you are asked to reduce the amount of fluid you drink, you must also take into account fluid in foods, such as soup and yoghurt. Your GP or dietitian can advise you about this. \n The excess fluid that occurs as a result of kidney disease often builds up in your ankles or around your lungs. You may also be given diuretics (water tablets), such as furosemide, which will help get rid of the excess fluid from your body. \n If you do not have any fluid retention and you\u00a0have not\u00a0been told\u00a0to reduce your fluid intake, there is no need to do so.\u00a0In fact, it could be harmful in some circumstances. \n Anaemia \n Many people with stage three, four and five CKD develop  anaemia . Anaemia is a condition in which you do not have enough red blood cells. Symptoms of anaemia include: \n \n tiredness\u00a0 \n lethargy\u00a0 \n shortness of breath (dyspnoea)\u00a0 \n palpitations (awareness of heartbeat)\u00a0 \n \n Anaemia can occur because of many other conditions and your doctor will investigate to rule out\u00a0other possible causes. \n Most people with kidney disease will be given iron supplements because iron is needed for the production of red blood cells. To boost iron levels, iron may be given as tablets, such as daily ferrous sulphate tablets, or as occasional intravenous infusions. \n If this is not enough to treat anaemia, you may be started on injections of erythropoietin, a hormone which helps your body produce more red blood cells. These injections are often administered into a vein (intravenously)\u00a0or under the skin (subcutaneously). Examples of these injections include epoetin alfa, beta and zeta, darbepoetin and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. \n Want to know more? \n \n NICE:  Treating anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease  \n \n Correction of phosphate balance \n If you have stage four or five kidney disease, you can get a build-up of phosphate in your body because your kidneys cannot get rid of it. Phosphate is a mineral that, with calcium, makes up most of your bones. Phosphate is obtained through diet, mainly dairy foods. The kidneys usually filter out\u00a0excess phosphate. If phosphate levels rise too much, it can upset the normal calcium balance of the body. This can lead to thinning of the bones and furring of the arteries. \n You may be asked to limit the amount of phosphate in your diet. Foods\u00a0high in phosphate include red meat, dairy produce, eggs and fish. Your GP or dietitian should be able to advise you about how much phosphate you can eat. However, there is no advantage in reducing your intake of these foods unless you have a raised phosphate level.\u00a0Always ask\u00a0a healthcare professional before changing your diet. \n If reducing the amount of phosphate in your diet does not lower your phosphate level enough, you may be given medicines called phosphate binders. These medicines bind to the phosphate in the food inside your stomach and stop it from being absorbed into your body. \n To work properly, phosphate binders must be taken just before meals. The most commonly used phosphate binder\u00a0is calcium carbonate, but there\u00a0are also alternatives that may be more suitable for\u00a0you. \n The side effects of phosphate binders are uncommon but include: \n \n nausea\u00a0 \n stomach ache\u00a0 \n constipation\u00a0 \n diarrhoea\u00a0 \n flatulence (wind)\u00a0 \n skin rash\u00a0 \n itchy skin \n \n Vitamin D supplements \n People with kidney disease can have low levels of vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones. This is because the kidneys need to activate the vitamin D from food and\u00a0the sun before it can be used by the body. \n Treatment for kidney failure \u2013 transplant or dialysis \n Many people with kidney failure can continue with treatment using medicines and will have good-functioning kidneys for the rest of their lives. \n In a few people, kidney disease will progress to the stage where the kidneys\u00a0stop working and it becomes life threatening. This is called kidney failure or established renal failure (ERF). \n This rarely\u00a0happens suddenly, and there will be time to plan the next stage of your condition. The decision whether to have dialysis, a kidney transplant or supportive treatment should be discussed with your healthcare team. \n Read more about  dialysis \u00a0and\u00a0kidney transplants. \n Supportive treatment \n If you decide not to have dialysis or a transplant for kidney failure, or they are not suitable for you,\u00a0you will be offered supportive treatment. \n This is also called palliative care. \n The aim is to treat and control the symptoms of kidney failure without using dialysis or transplantation. Supportive treatment includes medical, psychological and practical care for both the person with kidney failure and their family, including discussion about how you feel and  planning for the end of life . \n Many people choose supportive treatment because they: \n \n are unlikely to benefit or have quality of life with treatment \n do not want to go through the inconvenience of treatment with dialysis \n are advised against dialysis because they have other serious illnesses that will shorten their life, and the negative aspects of treatment outweigh any likely benefits\u00a0 \n have been on dialysis but have decided to stop this treatment\u00a0 \n are being treated with dialysis, but have another serious physical illness, especially severe heart disease or stroke, that will shorten their life \n \n If you choose to have supportive treatment, your kidney unit will still look after you. \n Doctors and nurses will make sure you receive: \n \n medicines to protect your remaining kidney function\u00a0for as long as possible\u00a0 \n medicines to treat other symptoms of kidney failure, such as feeling out of breath, anaemia, loss of appetite or itchy skin\u00a0 \n help\u00a0to plan your home and money affairs\u00a0 \n bereavement support for your family after your death \n \n Want to know more? \n \n Kidney Research UK:  Information on choosing not to start dialysis  \n National Kidney Federation:\u00a0 End of life care for people with advanced kidney disease  \n Bereavement support from\u00a0 CRUSE  \n \n What is good kidney disease care? \n According to a national review, kidney disease services should: \n \n identify people at risk of kidney disease, especially people with high blood pressure or diabetes, and treat them as early as possible to maintain their kidney function\u00a0 \n give people access to investigative treatment and follow them up to reduce the risk of the disease getting worse\u00a0 \n give people good-quality information about managing their condition\u00a0 \n provide information about the development of the disease and treatment options\u00a0 \n provide access to a specialist renal (kidney) team\u00a0 \n give people access to transplant or dialysis\u00a0services if required \n provide supportive care \n \n Your treatment for kidney disease will need to be reviewed regularly. \n It may be helpful for you to make a care plan because this can help you manage your day-to-day health. Your kidney disease specialist nurse may be able to help with this.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests. \n Screening \n If you are in a high-risk group for developing CKD, it is important\u00a0to be regularly screened for the condition. People who are not in a high-risk group are not normally screened for CKD. \n Annual screening is recommended for the following groups: \n \n people with  high blood pressure  (hypertension)\u00a0 \n people with  diabetes   \n people with\u00a0acute kidney injury caused by medications such as lithium or  NSAIDs  such as ibuprofen, kidney stones or an enlarged prostate \n people with cardiovascular disease (conditions that affect the heart, arteries and veins, such as coronary heart disease or  heart failure )\u00a0 \n people with a family history of stage five CKD (see below for more information about staging) or an inherited kidney disease \n people with diseases that affect several parts of the body and may affect the kidneys, such as systemic lupus erythematosus \n people with blood in the urine (haematuria) or protein in the urine (proteinuria) where there is no known cause \n \n Your GP can advise you about whether or not you should be screened for CKD. \n Most often, the diagnosis of kidney disease is made because a routine blood or urine test indicates the kidneys may not be functioning normally. If this happens, the test is usually repeated to\u00a0confirm the diagnosis. \n Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \n An effective way of assessing how well your kidneys are working is to calculate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is a measurement of how many millilitres (ml) of waste fluid your kidneys can filter from the blood in a minute (measured in ml/min). A healthy pair of kidneys should be able to filter more than 90ml/min. \n It is difficult to measure the GFR directly, so it is estimated using a formula. The result is called the estimated GFR or eGFR. Calculating your eGFR involves taking a blood sample and measuring the levels of a waste product called creatinine and taking into account your age, gender and ethnic group. The result is similar to the percentage of normal kidney function. For example, an eGFR of 50ml/min equates to 50% kidney function. \n The following tests are used to detect proteinuria (protein in the urine) \n \n urine tests \u2013 used to see whether there is blood or protein in your urine \n albumin and creatinine testing \u2013 this is another urine test which compares the amounts of albumin (a protein) and creatinine in your urine. The ratio of the two (the albumin:creatinine ratio or ACR) can be used with eGFR to give doctors a more accurate idea of how the kidneys are functioning \n \n Staging \n A six-stage system, based on eGFR levels, is used to describe the progression of CKD. The higher the stage, the more severe the CKD. The six stages are described below. \n \n Stage one (sometimes called G1): the eGFR is normal (above 90 or more), but other testing shows evidence of kidney damage. \n Stage two (G2): the eGFR has decreased slightly (60\u201389), but is still considered to be in the normal range for a young adult. \n \n If you have stage one or two CKD, it is recommended you have annual eGFR tests so the progression of the condition can be carefully monitored. \n \n Stage three is divided into two\u00a0\u2013 stage 3a (G3a) and 3b (G3b). In stage 3a, the eGFR has decreased mildly (45\u201359) and this is termed a mild to moderate decrease in kidney function and should be checked annually. In stage 3b (G3b) it has decreased moderately (30\u201344) and is termed a moderate to severe reduction in kidney function and should be checked every six months.\u00a0 \n Stage four (G4): the eGFR has reduced severely (15-29). By this time, it is possible you will be experiencing symptoms of CKD. Further testing should be carried out every six months. \u00a0 \n Stage five (G5): the kidneys have lost almost all of their function (an eGFR of below 15), which is known as established\u00a0renal failure. Further testing should be carried out every three months. \n \n However, over time, GFR can fluctuate, so one abnormal test result does not automatically mean you have CKD. A diagnosis of CKD is usually only confirmed if repeated eGFR tests show your eGFR is consistently lower than normal over three months.\u00a0 \n Other tests \n A number of other tests are also used to assess the levels of damage to your kidneys. These are outlined below: \n \n kidney scans, such as an ultrasound scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan \u2013 used to find out whether there are any unusual blockages in your urine flow. In cases of advanced kidney disease, the kidneys are shrunken and have an uneven shape \n kidney biopsy \u2013 a small sample of kidney tissue is taken so that the cells can be examined under a microscope for damage"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia", "introduction": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years. \n It mostly affects people over the age of 60 and is rare in people under 40.\u00a0Children are almost never affected. \n In chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL),\u00a0the spongy material found inside some bones (bone marrow)\u00a0produces too many white blood cells called lymphocytes that\u00a0aren't fully developed and don't work properly. \n Over time this can cause a range of problems, such as an increased risk of picking up infections, persistent tiredness,\u00a0swollen glands\u00a0in the neck, armpits or groin, and unusual bleeding or bruising. \n CLL is different\u00a0from other types of leukaemia, including  chronic myeloid leukaemia ,\u00a0 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  and  acute myeloid leukaemia . \n Symptoms of CLL \n CLL doesn't usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during a\u00a0 blood test  carried out for another reason. \n When symptoms develop, they may include: \n \n getting infections\u00a0often \n anaemia\u00a0\u2013 persistent tiredness,  shortness of breath  and pale skin \n bleeding and bruising more easily than normal \n a high temperature (fever) \n night sweats \n  swollen glands \u00a0in your\u00a0neck, armpits or groin \n swelling and discomfort in your tummy \n unintentional weight loss \n \n You should visit your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. These symptoms can have other causes other than cancer, but it's a good idea to get them checked out. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing CLL  and  complications of CLL . \n Treatments\u00a0for CLL \n As CLL\u00a0progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately. \n If it's caught early on, you'll have regular check-ups over the following months or years\u00a0to see if it's getting any worse. \n If CLL\u00a0starts to cause symptoms, or isn't diagnosed until later on, the main treatments are: \n \n  chemotherapy \u00a0\u2013 where medication\u00a0taken as a tablet or given directly into a vein is used to destroy the cancerous cells \n a  stem cell or bone marrow transplant \u00a0\u2013 where donated cells called stem cells are transplanted into your body so you start to produce healthy white blood cells \n \n Treatment can't\u00a0usually cure\u00a0CLL completely, but can slow its progression and lead to\u00a0periods where there are no symptoms. Treatment may be repeated if the condition comes back. \n Read more about treating CLL. \n Outlook for CLL \n The outlook for CLL depends on how advanced it is when it's diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and\u00a0your general health. \n Younger, healthier people who are diagnosed when\u00a0CLL is\u00a0still in the early stages generally have the best outlook. \n Although it can't normally be cured, treatment can help control the condition for many years. \n Overall, around\u00a0three in every\u00a0four people with CLL will live at least five years after diagnosis, but this can range from 10 years or more if caught early on, to less than a year if caught at a very advanced stage. \n Causes of CLL \n It's not clear what causes CLL. There's no proven link\u00a0with  radiation  or chemical exposure, diet or infections. You can't catch it from anyone else or pass it on. \n However, having certain genes can increase your chances of developing CLL. You may be at a slightly higher risk of it if you have a close family member with it, although this risk is still small.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "It's not known what causes most cases of leukaemia. However, there are many risk factors that are known to increase your chances of getting chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. \n Risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia include: \n \n having a family history of the condition \n being of European, American or Australian origin \n having certain medical conditions \n being male\u00a0 \n \n These are discussed in more detail below. \n Family history \n In some cases, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia appears to run in families. It's thought that an inherited\u00a0gene mutation (change to a gene) could increase your susceptibility to developing the condition. This means there may be certain genes in your family that make it more likely that you'll develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. \n More research is needed, but having a parent or sibling (brother or sister) with\u00a0chronic lymphocytic leukaemia slightly\u00a0increases your chances of also developing the condition. \n Ethnicity \n Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia most commonly affects people of European, American and Australian origin. \n It's rare in people from China, Japan and South East Asia, and it affects more white people than black people. It's not known why the condition affects people of some ethnic backgrounds and not others. \n Other medical conditions \n Research has shown that having certain medical conditions slightly increases your chances of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. These conditions include: \n \n  pneumonia (chest infection) \u00a0 \n  sinusitis \u00a0 \n  shingles \u00a0 \n autoimmune haemolytic anaemia \n long-term (chronic)\u00a0 osteoarthritis  \n  prostatitis (an inflamed prostate)  \n \n However, rather than causing\u00a0chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, some of these conditions may occur as a result of\u00a0having lowered immunity during the early stages of the condition. \n Having a lowered immunity due to having a condition such as  HIV or AIDS , or taking immunity lowering medication following an organ transplant can also increase your risk of developing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. \n Radiation exposure \n Exposure to\u00a0radiation is known to increase the risk of getting other types of leukaemia, but\u00a0it's not been linked specifically to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. \n The\u00a0 Cancer Research UK  website has more information about the  risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia . \n Sex and age \n For reasons that are unclear, men are around twice as likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukaemia than women. The risk of developing leukaemia also increases as you get older.", "treatment": "Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) largely depends on what stage the condition is at when it's diagnosed. \n You may just need to be monitored at first\u00a0if it's caught early on.  Chemotherapy  is the main treatment if it's more advanced. \n Treatment can often help keep CLL under control for many\u00a0years. \n It\u00a0may go away after treatment initially (known as remission), but will usually come back (relapse) a few months or years later and may need to be treated again. \n \u00a0 \n Stages of CLL \n Doctors use\u00a0\"stages\" to describe how far CLL has developed and help them determine when it needs to be treated. \n There are three main stages of CLL: \n \n stage A \u2013\u00a0you have enlarged lymph\u00a0glands in fewer than three areas (such as your neck, armpit or groin) and a high white blood cell count \n stage B \u2013\u00a0you have enlarged lymph glands in three or more areas and a high white blood cell count \n stage C \u2013\u00a0you have enlarged lymph\u00a0glands or an enlarged spleen, a high white blood cell count, and a low red blood cell or platelet count \n \n Stage B and C CLL are usually treated straight away. Stage A generally only needs to be treated if it's getting worse quickly or starting to cause symptoms. \n Monitoring early-stage CLL \n Treatment may not be needed if you don't have any symptoms when you're diagnosed with CLL. \n This is because: \n \n CLL\u00a0often develops very slowly and may not cause symptoms for\u00a0many years \n there's no benefit in starting treatment early \n treatment can cause significant side effects \n \n In these cases, you will normally just need regular visits to your doctor and\u00a0 blood tests \u00a0to monitor the condition. \n Treatment with chemotherapy will usually only be recommended if you develop symptoms, or tests show that the condition is getting worse. \n Chemotherapy for more advanced CLL \n Many people with CLL will eventually need to have chemotherapy. This involves taking medication to keep the cancer under control. \n There are a number of different medicines for CLL, but most people will take three main medications in treatment cycles lasting 28 days. \n These medicines are: \n \n fludarabine \u2013\u00a0usually taken as a tablet\u00a0for three to five days at the start of each treatment cycle \n cyclophosphamide \u2013 also\u00a0usually taken as a tablet\u00a0for three to five days at the start of each treatment cycle \n rituximab \u2013 given\u00a0into a vein over the course of\u00a0a few hours (intravenous infusion) at the\u00a0start of each treatment cycle \n \n Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide can usually be taken at home. Rituximab is given in hospital, and sometimes you may need to stay in hospital overnight. \n A number of different medicines can also be tried if you can't have these medicines, you've tried them but they didn't work, or your CLL has come back after treatment. \n These include bendamustine, chlorambucil, ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and prednisolone (a  steroid medication ). \n Side effects of treatment \n The medicines used to treat CLL can cause some significant side effects, including: \n \n persistent tiredness \n feeling sick \n an increased risk of infections \n easy bruising or bleeding \n anaemia\u00a0\u2013  shortness of breath , weakness and pale skin \n  hair loss \u00a0or thinning \n an irregular heartbeat \n an\u00a0 allergic reaction  \n \n Most side effects will pass once treatment stops. Let your care team know if you experience any side effects, as\u00a0there are some treatments that can help. \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy  \n Stem cell or bone marrow transplants \n  Stem cell or bone marrow transplants \u00a0are sometimes used to try to\u00a0get rid of CLL completely, or control it for longer periods. \n Stem cells\u00a0are cells produced by the spongy material found in the centre of some bones (bone marrow) that can turn into different types of blood cells, including white blood cells. \n A stem cell transplant involves: \n \n having high-dose chemotherapy and\u00a0 radiotherapy  to destroy\u00a0the cancerous cells in your body \n removing stem cells from the blood or bone marrow\u00a0of a donor\u00a0\u2013 this will ideally be someone closely related to you, such as a sibling \n transplanting the donor stem cells directly into one of your veins \n \n This\u00a0is the only potential cure for CLL,\u00a0but it's not done very often\u00a0as it's an intensive treatment and many people with CLL are older and not well enough for the benefits to outweigh the risks. \n The initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy\u00a0can place a significant strain on your body and cause\u00a0troublesome side effects. \n There's also a risk of serious problems after the transplant, such as graft versus host disease. This is where\u00a0the transplanted cells attack the other cells in your body. \n Other treatments for CLL \n There are also a number of other treatments that are sometimes used to help treat some of the problems caused by CLL, particularly if you can't have chemotherapy or it doesn't work. \n These include: \n \n  radiotherapy \u00a0to\u00a0shrink enlarged lymph glands or a swollen spleen \n surgery to remove a swollen spleen \n  antibiotics ,\u00a0antifungals and antiviral medications to help reduce your risk of picking up an infection during treatment \n  blood transfusions \u00a0to provide more red blood cells and\u00a0platelets (clotting\u00a0cells)\u00a0if you experience severe anaemia or problems with bleeding and bruising \n immunoglobulin replacement therapy\u00a0\u2013 a transfusion of\u00a0antibodies taken from donated blood that\u00a0can help prevent infections \n injections of medication called\u00a0granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to help boost the number of white blood cells \n \n You may also need additional treatment for any  complications of CLL  that develop. \n Deciding against treatment \n As many of the treatments for CLL can have unpleasant side effects that may affect your quality of life, you may decide against having a particular type of treatment. \n This is entirely your decision and your treatment team will respect any decision you make. \n You won't be rushed into deciding about your treatment, and before making a decision you can talk to your doctor, partner, family and friends. \n Pain relief and nursing care will still be available as and when you need it.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) are detected during blood tests carried out for another reason. \n However, you should visit your GP if you have worrying  symptoms of CLL , such as\u00a0persistent tiredness, unusual bleeding or bruising, unexplained weight loss or night sweats. \n Your GP may: \n \n ask about your symptoms and your medical and family history \n carry out a physical examination to check for problems such as  swollen glands  and a swollen spleen \n send off a blood\u00a0sample for testing \n \n If\u00a0your GP\u00a0thinks you could have CLL, you'll be referred to a hospital doctor called a haematologist, a specialist in blood disorders, for further tests. \n Some of the tests you might have are outlined below. \n Blood tests \n The main test used to help diagnose CLL is a type of\u00a0 blood test \u00a0called a full blood count. \n This is where the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample of your blood are checked in a laboratory. \n An abnormally high number of unusual white blood cells\u00a0(lymphocytes) can be a sign of\u00a0CLL. A detailed examination of these cells can usually confirm the diagnosis. \n X-rays and scans \n You may also have: \n \n a chest\u00a0 X-ray  \n an  ultrasound scan \u00a0of your tummy \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \n \n These tests can check for problems caused by CLL, such as swollen glands\u00a0or\u00a0a swollen\u00a0spleen,\u00a0and help\u00a0rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. \n Bone marrow biopsy \n Sometimes\u00a0the\u00a0haematologist\u00a0may\u00a0recommend removing a sample of your bone marrow\u00a0(bone marrow biopsy) so they can\u00a0examine it\u00a0under a microscope to check it for cancerous cells. \n The sample is removed\u00a0using\u00a0a needle inserted into your hip bone.  Local anaesthetic \u00a0is normally used to\u00a0numb the area where the needle is inserted, although you may experience some discomfort during the biopsy. \n The procedure will\u00a0last around 15 minutes and you shouldn't need to stay in hospital overnight. You may\u00a0have some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. \n Lymph node biopsy \n In some cases, removing and examining a swollen lymph gland can help confirm a diagnosis of CLL. This is known as a lymph node biopsy. \n The gland is removed during a minor operation carried out under either local or\u00a0 general anaesthetic , where you're asleep. You won't usually need to stay in hospital overnight. \n After the operation, you'll be left with a small wound that will be closed with stitches. \n Genetic tests \n Tests may also be carried out on your blood and bone marrow samples to check for any unusual genes in the cancerous cells. \n Identifying unusual genes in these cells can help your doctors decide how soon you should start treatment and which treatment is best for you. \n Some\u00a0 treatments for CLL  don't work as well in people with certain abnormal genes in the affected cells."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Chronic fatigue syndrome", "introduction": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long term condition that causes persistent fatigue (exhaustion) that doesn't go away with sleep or rest and affects everyday life. It most commonly affects the nervous and immune systems. Sometimes it is diagnosed as post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS). \n People with ME-CFS experience severe fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). This is when the body is not able to recover after using even small amounts of energy, leading to a flare up in symptoms. This fatigue feels very different to ordinary tiredness and may take a day or two to kick in after physical, mental or emotional exertion. \n Who is affected? \n It\u2019s estimated that about 20,000 people in Scotland have ME-CFS, while 250,000 in the UK, and around 17 million people worldwide are affected. It affects more women than men, can affect children and adults of all ages and from all social and ethnic groups. \n How will ME-CFS affect my quality of life? \n Not everyone will experience the same symptoms so it\u2019s important not to compare people with ME-CFS. People with chronic fatigue syndrome can have very different experiences of the condition and how long their symptoms last. The impact of symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. As symptoms change over time so does the impact they have on people\u2019s lives. \n How long will it last? \n Most people with ME-CFS improve over time, although some people don't make a full recovery. It's also likely there will be periods when symptoms get better or worse. Children and young people with ME-CFS are more likely to recover fully. \n How is chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosed? \n There is no single test to detect chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis is made after other possible known causes for symptoms have been excluded. The earlier the illness is recognised, the sooner you can get help to manage your symptoms. Many people with ME-CFS find it helps to keep a diary of their symptoms so that they can take this to their GP or specialist. \n Your GP will usually: \n \n make a physical and mental examination to rule out other conditions \n ask about recent travel, tick/insect bites, unusual infections and drug/alcohol use \n review current medication \n arrange tests \n \n They may be able to make a diagnosis after 3 or 4 months of seeing a pattern of symptoms. Anyone suspected of having chronic fatigue syndrome should be considered for a number of routine blood tests to identify other possible illnesses. More specialised investigation may be needed if the diagnosis remains in doubt. \n Some people with chronic fatigue syndrome also have another long term condition and it is important that you talk to your GP about how to manage the symptoms of the 2 conditions. \n How chronic fatigue syndrome is treated \n Treatment will focus on managing and reducing symptoms related to ME-CFS. This means that treatment plans need to be tailored to the individual as people experience different symptoms and these symptoms may change over time. Your GP may be able to refer you to a specialist chronic fatigue syndrome service or to services that can support you to manage individual symptoms and manage restricted activity.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (ME-CFS) vary from person to person, and there may be times when your symptoms improve and you'll be able to do some normal everyday activities. At other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life. \n If you experience new symptoms talk to your GP or specialist as the new symptoms may be unrelated to ME-CFS. Women often find that symptoms worsen at different times in their menstrual cycle. Not everyone will experience all of the symptoms but some of the common ones are listed below. \n Fatigue \n Severe and persistent fatigue or exhaustion most, or all of the time is one of the symptoms of ME-CFS that can help diagnosis. This feels very different from ordinary tiredness. Simple physical or mental activities, or combinations of activities, can leave people with chronic fatigue feeling completely exhausted and can also lead to an increase in other symptoms. This is known as post-exertional malaise (PEM) or is sometimes called \"payback\". This is when the body isn't able to recover after using even small amounts of energy. \n Other symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome include: \n \n feeling generally unwell \n pain \n sleep disturbance \n problems with concentration, thinking and memory (\u2018brain fog\u2019) \n speech and language problems, including word-finding difficulties \n poor temperature control \n dizziness \n hyper-sensitivity to light and sound \n nausea \n loss of appetite \n \n For a fuller list of symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome visit the  Action for M.E.  website. \n If pain, especially muscle pain, is more of a problem than fatigue,  fibromyalgia , may need to be considered. Fibromyalgia is a separate condition with its own diagnosis. \n Frustration,  anxiety , low mood and  depression  are sometimes experienced by people with chronic fatigue syndrome because of the impact of the condition and its symptoms on their lives. This does not mean that ME-CFS is a mental health condition.", "causes": "Further research  is needed to confirm what causes chronic fatigue syndrome. New evidence shows that there might be various factors involved and that there may be a number of different types of the illness. These different sub-groups of chronic fatigue syndrome still need more research to be identified, including how they lead to different experiences of the condition and how it develops. \n Chronic fatigue syndrome may appear suddenly or more slowly over time. It may follow an infection, typically, but not always, viral. Other possible triggers can be trauma, surgery and stressful major life events. However in some cases there may be no identifiable trigger for chronic fatigue syndrome.", "treatment": "Although there is no cure for chronic fatigue syndrome there are a number of ways to help manage your symptoms. \n Because of the complexity of the illness, its changing nature and the number of possible symptoms, different things work for different people. Your GP may be able to support you through managing your individual symptoms. They may be able to refer you to a specialist service or to a service that will help you to manage individual symptoms but this depends on the services available in your area. \n To decide what treatment is right for you, you should look at the evidence, including published research and patient surveys, and make sure you fully understand what the treatment involve, before you make a decision. You have the right to decline any treatment option you do not feel comfortable with. \n Your GP may suggest some of the following treatment options. \n Management of medicines \n Your GP may suggest reviewing and altering the medicines you receive, considering any other conditions you may already be receiving treatment for alongside the most important ME/CFS symptoms that need to be treated. \n Dietary advice \n Your illness may make it more difficult for you to make sure that you receive the right balance of nutrients in your diet due to loss of appetite and food intolerances. Your GP may be able to advise you on how you can alter and adjust your diet. \n Disability support advice \n Your GP may work with you or refer you to another therapist to suggest aids, activities or support that can help you to recover or adjust so that you can live to your full potential. \n Pacing advice \n Balancing periods of activity and rest and noticing what activities demand most from you, can allow you to reduce the number of episodes of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Pacing yourself involves stopping activities before you feel the impact so that you have energy in reserve. It\u2019s easy to do too much on a good day and then feel the impact later. It can take time to change your habits and stop doing something even while things are going well. However, doing this is key to managing your condition in the long term. A booklet on pacing is available from  Action for M.E.  \n Graded   exercise therapy (GET) \n This aims to gradually increase your ability to function and manage symptoms. It should always be carried out by a therapist who is experienced in chronic fatigue and has appropriate clinical supervision. \n Counselling \n Counselling can support you to adjust to the impact chronic fatigue can have on your life. This does not mean that the condition itself is psychological or \"made up\". \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n This can be used to reduce the level of symptoms, disability and distress resulting from living with a chronic illness. \n Alternative and holistic therapies \n Alternative or holistic therapies may provide some comfort to those with a long standing illnesses but be cautious of any method that claims to offer a cure for chronic fatigue. If the therapy has not been published in respected peer-reviewed journal or is expensive you should talk to your GP before trying it. Until further research is done, no-one can be certain whether someone with CFS/ME might benefit from alternative therapies. \n Living with chronic fatigue \n What can I do for myself? \n There are some things that you can do for yourself to help you manage the condition and still live your own life. Small changes can build and make a difference to your energy and mobility. This is called self-management. \n To help with this, you might try: \n \n Planning your time \u2013 record what you do so that you can build a picture of what uses more energy and what activities you can ask others to do for you. This will help you choose what is important to you and plan your day to achieve this. It will also show you if there are patterns of symptoms and when they appear during your day \n Rest and relaxation \u2013 this is very important for managing CFS/ME. You may need some support and advice on what that might mean for you in terms of your physical, mental and emotional activities for resting \n Getting support \u2013 being open with people and asking for help when you need it before you are exhausted is a key approach to managing your condition. Talking about how you are feeling is important for long term health conditions because of the impact your symptoms have on the way you live your life. While you are adjusting to the diagnosis and the change in your life, it may be helpful to get outside support such as counselling or CBT. Talk to your GP about emotional support available to you. \n \n Where can I get support? \n Even in its mildest form, chronic fatigue can have a significant emotional and financial impact on your life. A lack of understanding and awareness about CFS/ME means patients can experience disbelief, and even discrimination, from friends, family, health and social care professionals and employers. \n People need wider support in order to continue to manage aspects of their life. Information on entitlements to welfare benefits, accessing health and social care and others sources of support for patients and carers are available from  Action for M.E . \n Action for M.E. has a number of booklets that may be useful for people living with CFS/ME, their families and their health professionals. They also offer resources and services for children and young people affected by chronic fatigue and their families. \n  Peer support  \n In some regions of Scotland there are local support groups providing peer support, information and advice.  ALISS , Action for M.E.\u2019s  service directory and Peer Support Network  and  the M.E. Association  can assist with signposting to these groups.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

These are most likely to appear on the face, ears and scalp, under the arms, on the chest and belly, and on the arms and legs. \n Read more about the  symptoms of chickenpox . \n Chickenpox (known medically as varicella) is\u00a0caused by a virus called the varicella-zoster virus. It's spread\u00a0quickly and easily from someone who is infected. \n Read more about the  causes of chickenpox . \n Chickenpox is most common in children under the age of 10.\u00a0In fact, chickenpox is so common in childhood that over 90% of adults are immune to the condition because they've had it before. \n Children usually\u00a0catch chickenpox in winter and spring, particularly between March and May. \n What to do \n To prevent spreading the infection,\u00a0keep children off nursery or school until all their spots have crusted over. \n Chickenpox is infectious from 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0days before the rash starts, until all the blisters have crusted over (usually 5\u00a0to 6\u00a0days after the start of the rash). \n If your child has chickenpox, try to\u00a0keep them\u00a0away from public areas\u00a0to avoid contact with people who may not have had it, especially people who are at risk of serious problems, such as newborn babies, pregnant women and anyone with a weakened immune system (for example, people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets). \n Read more about what you need to do to  stop chickenpox spreading . \n Chickenpox treatment \n Chickenpox in children is\u00a0considered a\u00a0mild illness, but your child will probably feel pretty miserable\u00a0and irritable while they have it. \n Your child\u00a0may have\u00a0a fever for the first few days\u00a0of the illness. The spots can be incredibly itchy. \n There is no\u00a0specific treatment for chickenpox, but there are\u00a0pharmacy remedies that can\u00a0alleviate symptoms. These include\u00a0 paracetamol  to relieve fever, and calamine lotion\u00a0and cooling\u00a0gels to ease itching. \n In most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within one to two weeks. \n Read more about  chickenpox treatments . \n When to see a doctor \n For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own. \n However, some children can become more seriously ill with chickenpox and need to see a doctor. \n Contact your GP straight away if your child develops any abnormal symptoms, such as: \n \n if the blisters on their skin become infected\u00a0 \n if your child\u00a0has a\u00a0pain in their chest or has difficulty breathing \n \n Chickenpox in adults \n Chickenpox\u00a0may be a childhood illness, but adults can get it too. Chickenpox\u00a0tends to\u00a0be\u00a0more severe\u00a0in adults than children, and adults have\u00a0a higher risk of developing complications. \n Adults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over. They should seek medical advice if they develop any abnormal symptoms, such as infected blisters. \n Adults with chickenpox may benefit from taking antiviral medicine if treatment is started early in the course of the illness. Read more about  antivirals in the treatment of chickenpox . \n Who's at special risk? \n Some children and adults\u00a0are at special\u00a0risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. They include: \n \n pregnant women \n newborn babies \n people with a weakened immune system \n \n These people should seek medical advice as soon as they are exposed to the chickenpox virus or they develop chickenpox symptoms. \n They may need a\u00a0 blood test  to check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox. \n Read more about immunity testing and the  diagnosis of chickenpox \u00a0in people at special risk. \n Chickenpox in pregnancy \n Chickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies. It can cause serious complications for both the pregnant woman and her baby. See\u00a0 complications of chickenpox  for further information\u00a0on what to do if you are exposed to\u00a0chickenpox during pregnancy. \n Chickenpox and shingles \n Once you have had\u00a0chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection\u00a0and become immune to catching it again. However,\u00a0the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, remains inactive (dormant) in\u00a0your body's nerve tissues and can return\u00a0later in life as an illness called shingles. \n It's possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around. \n Read more about  shingles . \n Is there a vaccine against chickenpox? \n There is a\u00a0chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is only offered to children\u00a0and adults who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox complications. \n The recommended 2\u00a0doses of the vaccine is estimated to offer 98% protection from chickenpox in children and 75% protection in adolescents and adults. \n So it may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. Similarly, there is a chance that someone who has received the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming in close contact with a person who has shingles.", "symptoms": "The most commonly recognised chickenpox symptom is a spotty, blistering red rash that can cover the entire body. \n Chickenpox spots \n The\u00a0spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be: \n \n behind the ears \n on the face \n over the scalp \n on the chest and belly \n on the arms and legs \n \n However, the spots can be anywhere on the body, even inside the ears and mouth, on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet and inside the nappy area. \n Although the\u00a0rash starts as small, itchy red spots, these develop a\u00a0 blister  on top and become\u00a0intensely itchy after about 12-14 hours. \n After a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over. \n After 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally. \n New spots\u00a0can keep appearing in waves for 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0days after the rash begins. Therefore, different clusters of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out.\u00a0 \n Read more about how to ease the itchiness and other symptoms of chickenpox in our section on  chickenpox treatments . \n Find out what you can do to  stop chickenpox spreading . \n Feeling unwell \n Before the\u00a0rash appears, you or your child may\u00a0have some mild  flu -like symptoms, including: \n \n feeling sick \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over \n aching, painful muscles \n  headache  \n generally feeling unwell \n loss of appetite \n \n These flu-like symptoms, especially the fever, tend to be more common and worse in adults than in children. \n Unusual symptoms \n Most healthy children (and adults) recover from chickenpox with no lasting ill-effects simply by resting, just as with a cold or the flu. \n However, some children and\u00a0adults are unlucky and have a more severe bout. \n Contact your GP straight away if you or your child develop any abnormal symptoms, such as: \n \n the skin surrounding the blisters\u00a0becoming red and painful\u00a0 \n pain in the chest or difficulty breathing \n signs of  dehydration , such as fewer wet nappies, drowsiness and cold hands and feet \n \n In cases such as this, prescription medicine\u00a0or hospital treatment may be needed. \n Read more about  chickenpox complications .", "causes": "Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. You catch it by coming into contact with someone who is infected. \n Chickenpox is a very contagious infection. Around 90% of people who have not previously had chickenpox will become infected when they come into contact with the virus. \n How you catch\u00a0the virus \n The chickenpox virus is spread most easily from someone who has the rash. The blisters are very itchy and break open easily,\u00a0which can contaminate surfaces or objects. The virus may then be transferred by touching the surface or object, then touching your face. \n The virus is also\u00a0contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth\u00a0when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This can also contaminate surfaces or objects. \n It normally takes\u00a014 days for the  symptoms of chickenpox \u00a0to show after you have come into contact with the virus. However, this can vary from person to person \u2013 from as little as 7 days, up to 21 days.\u00a0This is called the \"incubation period\". \n Someone\u00a0with chickenpox is most infectious from 1\u00a0to 2\u00a0days before the rash appears, until all the blisters have crusted over. This usually takes 5\u00a0to 6\u00a0days\u00a0from the start of the rash. \n Read more about the  diagnosis of chickenpox \u00a0and how to  stop chickenpox spreading . \n Shingles \n If you have not had chickenpox before,\u00a0you can also\u00a0catch chickenpox from someone\u00a0with shingles (an infection caused by the same virus). However, it's not possible to catch shingles from someone who has chickenpox. \n Read more\u00a0about\u00a0 shingles .", "treatment": "There is no cure for chickenpox, and the virus usually clears up by itself without any treatment. \n However, there are ways of easing the itch and discomfort, and there are important steps you can take to  stop chickenpox spreading . \n Painkillers \n If your child is in pain or has a high temperature (fever), you can give them a mild painkiller, such as  paracetamol \u00a0(available over the counter in pharmacies). Always read the manufacturer's dosage instructions. \n Paracetamol is the preferred painkiller for treating the associated symptoms of chickenpox. This is due to a very small risk of\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as\u00a0 ibuprofen , causing adverse skin reactions during chickenpox.\u00a0 \n Avoid giving your child ibuprofen if they have  asthma \u00a0or a history of stomach problems. If you're not sure whether ibuprofen\u00a0is suitable, check with your GP or pharmacist. If your child is younger than 3\u00a0months old, you should always speak to your GP before giving your child any kind of pain relief. \n Never\u00a0give your child aspirin if you suspect or know\u00a0that they have chickenpox. \n If you're pregnant and need to take painkillers, then paracetamol is the first choice. You can use it\u00a0at any stage of pregnancy. Only take ibuprofen\u00a0during the second trimester (weeks 14-27 of the pregnancy). \n If you're pregnant and have chickenpox, you should visit your GP as soon as possible. You may need to have antiviral medicine or immunoglobulin treatment to prevent your symptoms\u00a0from getting worse. \n Keeping hydrated \n It is important\u00a0for children (and adults) with chickenpox\u00a0to drink plenty of water to avoid  dehydration . Sugar-free ice lollies\u00a0are a good way of getting fluids into children. They also help to soothe a sore mouth that has chickenpox spots in it.\u00a0 \n Avoid anything that may make the\u00a0mouth sore, such as salty foods. Soup is easy to swallow as long as it is not too hot. \n Stop the scratching \n Chickenpox can be incredibly itchy, but it's important\u00a0for children (and adults)\u00a0to not scratch the spots, to avoid future scarring. \n One\u00a0way of stopping scratching is to keep fingernails clean and short. You can also\u00a0put socks over your child's hands at night to stop them scratching the rash as they sleep. \n If your child's skin is very itchy or sore, try using calamine lotion or cooling gels.\u00a0These are\u00a0available in pharmacies and are\u00a0very safe to use. They have a soothing, cooling effect. \n A stronger medicine called chlorphenamine\u00a0can also help\u00a0to relieve the itching.\u00a0It's available from your pharmacist over the counter or it can be\u00a0prescribed by your GP.\u00a0Chlorphenamine is\u00a0taken by mouth and is suitable for children over 1\u00a0year old. \n Cool clothing \n If your child has a fever, or if their skin is sore and aggravated, dress them appropriately so that they don't get too hot or too cold. Loose-fitting, smooth, cotton fabrics are best and\u00a0will help stop the skin from becoming sore and irritated. \n If your child has chickenpox, avoid sponging them down with cool water. This can make your child too cold and may make them shiver. \n Stronger treatments \n Antiviral medicine \n Aciclovir is an antiviral medicine that is sometimes given to people with chickenpox. \n Aciclovir may be prescribed to: \n \n pregnant women \n adults, if they visit their GP within 24 hours of the rash appearing \n newborn babies \n people with a weakened immune system (the body\u2019s defence system) \n \n Ideally, aciclovir needs to be started within 24 hours of\u00a0the rash appearing. It does not cure chickenpox, but it makes the symptoms less severe. You\u00a0normally need to take the medicine as tablets 5\u00a0times a day for 7\u00a0days. \n If you are taking aciclovir, make sure you drink plenty of fluids. Side effects are rare, but can include nausea and  diarrhoea . \n Immunoglobulin treatment \n Immunoglobulin is a solution of antibodies that is taken from healthy donors. Varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) contains antibodies to the chickenpox virus. \n Immunoglobulin treatment is given by injection. It is not used to treat chickenpox, but to protect people who are at high risk\u00a0of developing a severe chickenpox infection. This includes: \n \n pregnant women \n newborn babies \n people with weakened immune systems \n \n In the case of pregnant women, immunoglobulin treatment also reduces the risk of the unborn baby becoming infected. \n As the supply of VZIG is limited, it will only be considered if a high-risk person has: \n \n been significantly exposed to the virus \u2013 significant exposure could be face-to-face contact with someone who has chickenpox \n been in the same room for 15 minutes with someone who has chickenpox \n had a blood test to confirm that\u00a0they've not had chickenpox before \n \n In some cases, newborn babies may be given immunoglobulin treatment without having a blood test first. \n Read more about the  complications of chickenpox .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "You or your child should not usually need any medical tests to diagnose chickenpox. You can be pretty sure that it is chickenpox if there are the key symptoms of a mild fever followed by an itchy rash, with blisters and scabs. \n Chickenpox\u00a0spots are\u00a0usually\u00a0distinctive enough\u00a0to distinguish from other rashes, although they can be confused with other conditions that affect the skin, such as  insect bites  or  scabies  (another contagious skin condition that causes intense itching). \n If\u00a0you're uncertain\u00a0about what is causing the symptoms, your GP can carry out a simple blood test to identify the virus. \n  Find your local GP surgery . \n When to contact your GP \n 1. See your GP if you're not sure whether you or your child have chickenpox. \n 2. Contact your GP\u00a0urgently if you have been in contact with someone who has chickenpox, or you have chickenpox symptoms and: \n \n you are pregnant \n you have a weakened immune system (the body\u2019s defence system) \n your baby is less than 4\u00a0weeks old \n \n Chickenpox in these\u00a0instances can cause serious complications, if left untreated. It is essential to seek medical advice so that you can receive any necessary treatment. \n 3.\u00a0Contact your GP if you have chickenpox and are breastfeeding. They can advise about whether you should continue breastfeeding your baby. \n Having a blood test \n Once you have contacted your GP,\u00a0you\u00a0may need\u00a0a test\u00a0to see if you're already\u00a0immune from chickenpox. \n If you have had chickenpox in the past, it is extremely unlikely that you will develop chickenpox for a second time. If you've never had chickenpox, or you're unsure whether you've had it, you may need an immunity\u00a0test. \n This is a\u00a0 blood test  that checks whether you are producing the antibodies to the chickenpox virus. \n If your blood test result shows that you have the antibodies, you'll be naturally protected from the virus. If you don't have the antibodies, you'll need to be monitored closely to see if you develop  chickenpox symptoms . If\u00a0you do, further treatment may be needed. \n Read more about  chickenpox treatment ."},

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Chest infection", "introduction": "Chest infections are common, especially after a  cold  or  flu  during autumn and winter. \n Although most are mild and get better on their own, some can be serious or even life-threatening. \n This page covers: \n  Signs and symptoms of a chest infection  \n  What causes chest infections?  \n  Caring for your symptoms at home  \n  When to see a doctor  \n  Preventing chest infections  \n Signs and symptoms of a chest infection \n The main symptoms of a chest infection can include: \n \n a persistent  cough  \n coughing up yellow or green phlegm (thick mucus), or coughing up blood \n  breathlessness  or rapid and shallow breathing \n wheezing \n a high temperature (fever) \n a rapid heartbeat \n chest pain or tightness \n feeling confused and disorientated \n \n You may also experience more general symptoms of an infection, such as a  headache , fatigue, sweating, loss of appetite, or joint and muscle pain. \n What causes chest infections? \n A chest infection is an infection of the lungs or airways. The main types of chest infection are  bronchitis  and  pneumonia . \n Most bronchitis cases are caused by viruses, whereas most pneumonia cases are due to bacteria. \n These infections are usually spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This launches tiny droplets of fluid containing the virus or bacteria into the air, where they can be breathed in by others. \n The infections can also be spread to others if you cough or sneeze onto your hand, an object or a surface, and someone else shakes your hand or touches those surfaces before touching their mouth or nose. \n Certain groups of people have a higher risk of developing serious chest infections, such as: \n \n babies and very young children \n children with developmental problems \n people who are very overweight \n elderly people \n pregnant women \n people who smoke \n people with long-term health conditions, such as  asthma ,  heart disease ,  diabetes ,  kidney disease ,  cystic fibrosis  or  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  \n people with a weakened immune system \u2013 this could be due to a recent illness, a transplant, high-dose steroids,  chemotherapy  or a health condition, such as an undiagnosed  HIV  infection \n \n Read more about the  causes of bronchitis  and the  causes of pneumonia  \n Caring for your symptoms at home \n Many chest infections aren't serious and get better within a few days or weeks. You won't usually need to see your GP, unless your symptoms suggest you have a more serious infection (see below). \n While you recover at home, you can improve your symptoms by: \n \n getting plenty of rest \n drinking lots of fluid to prevent  dehydration  and to loosen the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up \n treating headaches, fever and aches and pains with painkillers \u2013 such as  paracetamol  or  ibuprofen  \n drinking a warm drink of honey and lemon \u2013 to relieve a  sore throat  caused by persistent coughing \n raising your head up with extra pillows while you're sleeping \u2013 to make breathing easier \n using an air humidifier or inhaling steam from a bowl of hot water \u2013 to ease your cough (hot water shouldn't be used to treat young children with a cough, due to the risk of  scalds ) \n stopping smoking \n \n Avoid cough medicines, as there's little evidence they work, and coughing actually helps you clear the infection more quickly by getting rid of the phlegm from your lungs. \n  Antibiotics  aren't recommended for many chest infections, because they only work if the infection is caused by bacteria, rather than a virus. \n Your GP will usually only prescribe antibiotics if they think you have pneumonia, or you're at risk of complications such as fluid building up around the lungs ( pleurisy ). \n If there's a flu outbreak in your local area and you're at risk of serious infection, your GP may also prescribe antiviral medication. \n Read more about  treating bronchitis  and  treating pneumonia  \n When to see a doctor \n You should see your GP if: \n \n you feel very unwell or your symptoms are severe \n your symptoms are not improving \n you feel confused, disorientated or drowsy \n you have chest pain or difficulty breathing \n you cough up blood or blood-stained phlegm \n your skin or lips develop a blue tinge (cyanosis) \n you're pregnant \n you're 65 or over \n you're very overweight and have difficulty breathing \n you think a child under five has a chest infection \n you have a weakened immune system \n you have a long-term health condition \n \n Your GP should be able to diagnose you based on your symptoms and by listening to your chest using a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs). \n In some cases, further tests \u2013 such as a chest  X-ray , breathing tests and testing phlegm or  blood samples  \u2013 may be necessary. \n Preventing chest infections \n There are measures you can take to help reduce your risk of developing chest infections and stop them spreading to others. \n Stop smoking \n If you smoke, one of the best things you can do to prevent a chest infection is to stop. Smoking damages your lungs and weakens your defences against infection. \n Read more information and advice about  stopping smoking  \n Good hygiene \n Although chest infections generally aren't as contagious as other common infections, like flu, you can pass them on to others through coughing and sneezing. \n Therefore, it's important to cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and to wash you hands regularly. Put tissues in the bin immediately. \n Alcohol and diet \n Excessive and prolonged  alcohol misuse  can weaken your lungs' natural defences against infections and make you more vulnerable to chest infections. \n To keep your risk of alcohol-related harm low, the NHS recommends: \n \n not regularly drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week \n if you drink as much as 14 units a week, it's best to spread this evenly over three or more days \n if you're trying to reduce the amount of alcohol you drink, it's a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week \n \n Regular or frequent drinking means drinking alcohol most weeks. The risk to your health is increased by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. \n Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help strengthen the immune system, making you less vulnerable to developing chest infections. \n Read more about  healthy eating  and  tips on cutting down on alcohol  \n Vaccinations \n If you're at an increased risk of chest infections, your GP may recommend being vaccinated against flu and pneumococcal infections (a bacterium that can cause pneumonia). \n These vaccinations should help to reduce your chances of getting chest infections in the future. \n Flu and pneumococcal vaccinations are usually recommended for: \n \n babies and young children \n pregnant women (flu jab only) \n people aged 65 and over \n people with long-term health conditions or weakened immune systems", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bowel cancer", "introduction": "Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer. \n Cancer can sometimes start in the small bowel (small intestine), but small bowel cancer is much rarer than large bowel cancer. \n Bowel cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in the UK, with around 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. \n About\u00a01 in every 20 people in the UK will develop bowel cancer\u00a0in their lifetime. \n Signs and symptoms \n The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit\u00a0\u2013 such as more frequent, looser stools\u00a0\u2013 and\u00a0 abdominal (tummy) pain . \n However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by\u00a0 haemorrhoids  (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually\u00a0the result of\u00a0something you have eaten. \n As almost 9\u00a0out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over the age of 60, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments. \n Most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following combination of\u00a0symptoms: \n \n a persistent change in bowel habit that causes them to go to the toilet more often and pass looser stools, usually together with blood on or in their stools \n a persistent change in bowel habit without blood in their stools, but with abdominal pain \n blood in the stools without other haemorrhoid symptoms, such as soreness, discomfort, pain, itching or a lump hanging down outside the back passage \n abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always provoked by eating, sometimes resulting in a reduction in the amount of food eaten and weight loss \n \n The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don't necessarily make you feel ill. \n When to seek medical advice \n Read about the  symptoms of\u00a0bowel cancer , and when you should see your GP to discuss whether any tests are necessary. \n Your doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps. \n They may also\u00a0arrange for a simple blood test to check for\u00a0iron deficiency anaemia\u00a0\u2013 this can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven't been aware of. \n In some cases, your doctor may decide it is best for you to have a simple test in hospital to make sure there is no serious cause for your symptoms. \n Make sure you return to your doctor if your symptoms persist or keep coming back after stopping treatment, regardless of their severity or your age. \n Read more about  diagnosing bowel cancer  \n Who's at risk? \n It's not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk. These include: \n \n age \u2013 almost\u00a09 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over \n diet \u2013 a diet high in red or processed meats and low in fibre can increase your risk \n weight \u2013 bowel cancer is more common in people who are overweight or obese \n exercise \u2013 being inactive increases the risk of getting bowel cancer \n alcohol and smoking \u2013 a high alcohol intake and smoking may increase your chances of getting bowel cancer \n family history \u2013 having a close relative (mother or father, brother or sister) who developed bowel cancer\u00a0under the age of\u00a050 puts you at a greater lifetime risk of developing the condition \n \n Some people have an increased risk of bowel cancer because they have another condition that affects their bowel, such as severe  ulcerative colitis  or  Crohn's disease , over a long period of time. \n Read more about the  causes of bowel cancer  and  preventing bowel cancer  \n Bowel cancer screening \n  Bowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland to help find bowel cancer early when it can often be cured.   \n  Bowel screening involves taking a   simple test   at home every 2 years. The test looks for hidden blood in your poo, as this could mean a higher chance of bowel cancer.  \n Read more about  screening for bowel cancer  \n Treatment and outlook \n Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread. \n The main treatments are: \n \n surgery \u2013\u00a0the cancerous section of bowel is removed; it is the most effective way of curing bowel cancer, and is all that many people need \n  chemotherapy  \u2013 where medication is used to kill cancer cells\u00a0 \n  radiotherapy  \u2013 where radiation is used to kill cancer cells \n biological treatments \u2013 a newer type of medication that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading \n \n As with most types of cancer, the chances of a complete cure depends on how far\u00a0it\u00a0has advanced by the time it is diagnosed. If the cancer is confined to the bowel, surgery will usually be able to completely remove it. \n Overall, 7 to 8 in every 10 people with bowel cancer will live at least one year after diagnosis. More than half of those diagnosed will live at least another 10 years. Every year, around 16,000 people die as a result of bowel cancer. \n Read more about  how bowel cancer is treated  and  living with bowel cancer", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. \n Most cases of bowel cancer first develop inside clumps of cells on the inner lining of the bowel. These clumps are known as  polyps . However, if you develop polyps, it does not necessarily mean you will get bowel cancer. \n Exactly what causes cancer to develop inside the bowel is still unknown. However, research has shown several factors may make you more likely to develop it. These factors are outlined below. \n Age \n Your chances of developing bowel cancer increase as you get older. Almost\u00a09 out of 10 cases of bowel cancer in the UK are diagnosed in people over the age of 60. \n Family history \n Having a family history of bowel cancer can increase your risk of developing the condition yourself, particularly if a close relative (mother, father, brother or sister) was diagnosed with bowel cancer below the age of 50. \n If you are particularly concerned that your family's medical history may mean you are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer, it may help to speak to your GP. \n If necessary, your GP can refer you to a genetics specialist, who can offer more advice about your level of risk and recommend any necessary tests to periodically check for the condition. \n Diet \n A large body of evidence suggests a diet high in red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing bowel cancer. \n For this reason, the Department of Health advises people who eat more than 90g (cooked weight) a day of red and processed meat cut down to 70g a day. \n Read more about  red meat and bowel cancer risk  \n There is also evidence that\u00a0suggests a diet high in fibre could help reduce your bowel cancer risk. \n Read more about  eating good food and a healthy diet  \n Smoking \n People who smoke cigarettes are more likely to develop bowel cancer, other types of cancer, and other serious conditions, such as\u00a0 heart disease . \n Read more about  stopping smoking  \n Alcohol \n Drinking alcohol has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly if you regularly drink large amounts. \n Read about  drinking and alcohol  for information and tips on cutting down \n Obesity \n Being overweight or  obese  is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, particularly in men. \n If you are overweight or obese,  losing weight  may help lower your chances of developing the condition. \n Inactivity \n People who are physically inactive have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. \n You can help reduce your risk of bowel and other cancers by being physically active every day. \n Read more about  health and fitness  \n Digestive disorders \n Some conditions affecting the bowel may put you at a higher risk of developing bowel cancer. For example, bowel cancer is more common in people who have had severe\u00a0 Crohn's disease \u00a0or  ulcerative colitis  for many years. \n If you have one of these conditions, you will usually have regular check-ups to look for signs of bowel cancer from about 10 years after your symptoms first develop. \n Check-ups will involve examining your bowel with a colonoscope\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a long, narrow flexible tube\u00a0that contains\u00a0a small camera\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that is inserted into your rectum. \n The frequency of the colonoscopy examinations will increase the longer you live with the condition, and will also depend on factors such as how severe your ulcerative colitis is and if you have a family history of bowel cancer. \n Genetic conditions \n There are two rare inherited conditions that can lead to bowel cancer. They are: \n \n familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) \u2013 a condition that triggers the growth of non-cancerous polyps inside the bowel \n hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome \u2013 an inherited gene fault (mutation) that increases your bowel cancer risk \n \n Although the polyps caused by FAP are non-cancerous, there is a high risk that, over time, at least one will turn cancerous. Most people with FAP will have bowel cancer by the time they are 50. \n As people with FAP have such a high risk of getting bowel cancer, they are often advised by their doctor to have their large bowel removed before they reach the age of 25. \n Families affected can find support and advice from FAP registries such as  The Polyposis Registry  provided by St Mark's Hospital, London. \n Removing the bowel as a precautionary measure is also usually recommended in people with HNPCC because the risk of developing bowel cancer is so high. \n Want to know more? \n \n Beating Bowel Cancer:  causes  \n Bowel Cancer UK:  why do I need fibre in my diet?  \n Cancer Research UK:  risk factors", "treatment": "If\u00a0colon cancer is at a very early stage, it may be possible to remove just a small piece of the lining of the colon wall. This is known as local excision. \n If the cancer spreads into\u00a0muscles surrounding the colon, it will usually be necessary to remove an entire section of your colon.\u00a0This is known as a colectomy. \n There are two ways a colectomy can be performed: \n \n an open colectomy \u2013 where the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) in your abdomen and removes a section of your colon \n a laparoscopic (keyhole) colectomy \u2013 where the surgeon makes a number of small incisions in your abdomen and uses special instruments guided by a camera to remove a section of colon \n \n During surgery, nearby lymph nodes are also removed. It is usual to join the ends of the bowel together after bowel cancer surgery, but very occasionally this is not possible and a stoma is needed. \n Both open and laparoscopic colectomies are thought to be equally effective at removing cancer and have similar risks of complications. \n However, laparoscopic colectomies have the advantage of a faster recovery time and less postoperative pain. It is becoming the routine way of doing most of these operations. \n Laparoscopic colectomies should be available in all hospitals that carry out bowel cancer surgery, although not all surgeons perform this type of surgery. Discuss your options with your surgeon to see if this method can be used. \n Surgery for rectal cancer \n There are a number of different types of operation that can be carried out to treat rectal cancer, depending on how far the cancer has spread. \n Some of the main techniques used are described below: \n Local resection \n If you have a very small, early-stage rectal cancer, your surgeon may be able to remove it in an operation called a local resection (transanal resection). \n The surgeon puts an endoscope in through your back passage and removes the cancer from the wall of the rectum. \n Total mesenteric excision \n In many cases, however, a local resection is not possible. Instead, a larger area of the rectum will need to be removed. \n This area will\u00a0include a border of rectal tissue free of cancer cells, as well as fatty tissue\u00a0from around the bowel\u00a0(the mesentery). This type of operation is known as total mesenteric excision (TME). \n Removing the mesentery can help ensure all the cancerous cells are removed, which can lower the risk of the cancer recurring at a later stage. \n Depending on where in your rectum the cancer is located, one of two main TME operations may be carried out. These are outlined below. \n Low anterior resection \n Low anterior resection is a procedure used to treat cases where the cancer is in the upper section of your rectum. \n The surgeon will make an incision in your abdomen and remove the upper section of your rectum, as well as some surrounding tissue to make sure any lymph glands containing cancer cells are also removed. \n They will then attach your colon to the lowest part of your rectum or upper part of the anal canal. Sometimes they turn the end of the colon into an internal pouch to replace the rectum. \n You will probably require a temporary stoma\u00a0to give the joined section of bowel time to heal. \n Abdominoperineal resection \n Abdominoperineal resection is used to treat cases where the cancer is in the lowest section of your rectum. \n In this case, it will be necessary to remove the whole of your rectum and surrounding muscles to reduce the risk of the cancer regrowing in the same area. \n This involves removing and closing the anus and removing its sphincter muscles, so there is no option except to have a permanent stoma after the operation. \n Bowel cancer surgeons always do their best to avoid giving people permanent stomas wherever possible. \n Stoma surgery \n Where a section of the bowel is removed and the remaining bowel joined, the surgeon may sometimes decide to divert your stool away from the join to allow it to heal. \n The stool is temporarily diverted by bringing a loop of bowel out through the abdominal wall and attaching it to the skin \u2013 this is called a stoma. A bag is worn over the stoma to collect the stool. \n When the stoma is made from the small bowel (ileum) it is called an  ileostomy , and when it is made from the\u00a0large bowel (colon) it is called a  colostomy .\u00a0 \n A specialist nurse, known as a stoma care nurse, can advise you on the best site for a stoma\u00a0prior to surgery. \n The nurse will take into account factors such as your body shape and lifestyle, although this may not be possible where surgery is performed in an emergency. \n In\u00a0the first few days\u00a0after surgery, the stoma care nurse will advise on the care necessary to look after the stoma and the type of bag suitable. \n Once the join in the bowel has safely healed, which can take several weeks, the stoma can be closed\u00a0during further surgery. \n In some people, for various reasons, rejoining the bowel may not be possible or may lead to problems controlling bowel function, and the stoma may become permanent. \n Before having surgery, the care team will advise you about whether it may be necessary to form an ileostomy or colostomy, and the likelihood of this being temporary or permanent. \n There are patient support groups available that provide support for patients who have just had or are about to have a stoma. You can\u00a0get more\u00a0details from\u00a0your stoma care nurse, or visit the groups\u00a0online for further information. \n These\u00a0include: \n \n  Ileostomy and Internal Pouch Support Group \u00a0\u2013 this organisation provides a unique visiting service for anyone wishing to speak with someone who has been through similar surgery \n \n Learn more about\u00a0 coping with a stoma after bowel cancer  \n Side effects of surgery \n Bowel cancer operations carry many of the same risks as other major operations, including bleeding, infection, developing blood clots, or heart or breathing problems.\u00a0 \n The operations all carry a number of risks specific to the procedure. One risk is that the joined up section of bowel may not heal properly and leak inside your abdomen. This is usually only a risk in the first few days after the operation. \n Another risk is for people having rectal cancer surgery. The nerves that control urination\u00a0and sexual function are very close to the rectum, and sometimes\u00a0surgery to remove a rectal cancer can damage these nerves. \n After rectal cancer surgery, most people need to go to the toilet to open their bowels more often than before, although\u00a0this usually settles down within a few months of the operation. \n Radiotherapy \n There are two main ways radiotherapy can be used to treat bowel cancer. It can be given before surgery to shrink rectal cancers and increase the chances of complete removal, or be used to control symptoms and slow the spread of cancer in advanced cases (palliative radiotherapy). \n Radiotherapy given before surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in two ways: \n \n  external radiotherapy  \u2013 where a machine is used to beam high-energy waves at your rectum to kill cancerous cells \n  internal radiotherapy  (brachytherapy) \u2013 where a radioactive tube is inserted into your anus and placed next to the cancer to shrink it \n \n External radiotherapy is usually given daily, five days a week, with a break at the weekend. Depending on the size of your tumour, you may need one to five weeks of treatment. Each session of radiotherapy is short and will only last for 10 to 15 minutes. \n Internal radiotherapy can usually be performed in one session before surgery is carried out a few weeks later. \n Palliative radiotherapy is usually given in short daily sessions, with a course ranging from 2 to 3 days, up to 10 days. \n Short-term side effects of radiotherapy can include: \n \n feeling sick \n fatigue \n  diarrhoea  \n burning and irritation of the skin around the rectum and pelvis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this looks and feels like sunburn \n a frequent need to urinate \n a burning sensation when passing urine \n \n These side effects should pass once the course of radiotherapy has finished. Tell your care team if the side effects of treatment become particularly troublesome. Additional treatments are often available to help you cope with the side effects\u00a0better. \n Long-term side effects of radiotherapy can include: \n \n a more frequent need to pass urine or stools \n blood in your urine and stools \n  infertility  \n  erectile dysfunction  \n \n If you want to have children, it may be possible to store a sample of your sperm or eggs before treatment begins so they can be used in fertility treatments in the future. \n Chemotherapy \n There are three ways\u00a0 chemotherapy  can be used to treat bowel cancer: \n \n before surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0used in combination with radiotherapy\u00a0to shrink the tumour \n after surgery\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to reduce the risk of the cancer recurring \n palliative chemotherapy\u00a0\u2013 to slow the spread of advanced bowel cancer and help control symptoms \n \n Chemotherapy for bowel cancer usually involves taking a combination of medications that kill cancer cells. They can be given as a tablet (oral chemotherapy), through a drip in your arm (intravenous chemotherapy), or as a combination of both. \n Treatment is given in courses (cycles) that are\u00a0two to three weeks long each, depending on the stage or grade of your cancer. \n A single session of intravenous chemotherapy can last from several hours to several days. \n Most people having oral chemotherapy take tablets over the course of two weeks before having a break from treatment for another week. \n A course of chemotherapy can last up to six months, depending on how well you respond to the treatment. In some cases, it can be given in smaller doses over longer periods of time (maintenance chemotherapy). \n Side effects of chemotherapy can include: \n \n fatigue \n feeling sick \n vomiting \n diarrhoea \n  mouth ulcers  \n  hair loss  with certain treatment regimens, but this is generally uncommon in the treatment of bowel cancer \n a sensation of numbness, tingling or burning in your hands, feet and neck \n \n These side effects should gradually pass once your treatment has finished. It usually takes a few months for your hair to grow back if you experience hair loss. \n Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. \n Inform your care team or GP as soon as possible if you experience possible signs of an infection, including a high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of being generally unwell. \n Medications used in chemotherapy can cause temporary damage to men's sperm and women's eggs. This means that for women who become pregnant or for men who father a child, there is a risk to the unborn baby's health.\u00a0 \n It\u00a0is therefore\u00a0recommended you use a reliable method of contraception while having chemotherapy treatment and for a period after your treatment has finished. \n Find out more about\u00a0 chemotherapy \u00a0\u00a0 \n Biological treatments \n Biological treatments, including cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab, are a newer type of medication also known as monoclonal antibodies. \n Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have been genetically engineered in a laboratory. They target special proteins found on the surface of cancer cells, known as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR). \n As EGFRs help the cancer grow, targeting these proteins can help shrink tumours, and improve the effect and outcome of chemotherapy. \n Biological treatments are therefore usually used in combination with chemotherapy when the cancer has spread beyond the bowel (metastatic bowel cancer). \n These treatments are not available to everyone with bowel cancer. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has specific criteria\u00a0that need to be met before these can be prescribed. \n Cetuximab is only available on the NHS when: \n \n surgery to remove the cancer in the colon or rectum has been carried out or is possible \n bowel cancer has spread to the liver and cannot be removed surgically \n a person is fit enough to undergo surgery to remove the cancer from the liver if this becomes possible after treatment with cetuximab \n \n Cetuximab, bevacizumab and panitumumab are available on the NHS through a government scheme called the\u00a0Cancer Drugs Fund. All these medications are also available privately, but are very expensive. \n More information on all of the above is available from: \n \n Macmillan:\u00a0 targeted therapies (biological therapies) for colon cancer  \n National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE):  cetuximab for metastatic colorectal cancer  \n Beating Bowel Cancer:  surgery  \n Cancer Research UK:  types of surgery for bowel cancer  \n Bowel Cancer UK:\u00a0 radiotherapy for bowel cancer  \n Cancer Research UK:\u00a0 radiotherapy for bowel cancer  \n Macmillan:\u00a0 radiotherapy for rectal cancer  \n National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE):  preoperative brachytherapy for rectal cancer", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "When you first see your GP, they will ask about your symptoms and whether you have a family history of bowel cancer. \n They will then usually carry out a simple examination of your abdomen (tummy) and your bottom, known as a digital rectal examination (DRE). \n This is a useful way of checking whether there are any lumps in your tummy or back passage. The tests can be uncomfortable, and most people find an examination of the back passage a little embarrassing, but they take less than a minute. \n If your symptoms suggest you may have bowel cancer or the diagnosis is uncertain, you will be referred to your local hospital initially for a simple examination called a flexible sigmoidoscopy. \n In 2015, the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer and refer people for the right tests faster. \n To find out if you should be referred for further tests for suspected bowel cancer, read the NICE 2015 guidelines on  suspected cancer: recognition and referral . \n Flexible sigmoidoscopy \n A flexible sigmoidoscopy is an examination of your rectum and some of your large bowel using a device called a sigmoidoscope. \n A sigmoidoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a very small camera and light. It is inserted into your rectum and up into your bowel. \n The camera relays images to a monitor, and can also be used to take  biopsies , where a small tissue sample is removed for further analysis. \n It is better for your lower bowel to be as empty as possible when sigmoidoscopy is performed, so you may be asked to carry out an enema\u00a0\u2013 a simple procedure to flush your bowels\u00a0\u2013 at home beforehand. This should be used at least two hours before you leave home for your appointment. \n A sigmoidoscopy can feel uncomfortable, but it only takes a few minutes and most people go home straight after the examination. \n More detailed tests \n Most people with bowel cancer can be diagnosed by flexible sigmoidoscopy. However, some cancers can only be diagnosed by a more extensive examination of the colon. \n The two tests used for this are colonoscopy and computerised tomography (CT) colonography. These tests are described in more detail below. \n Colonoscopy \n A colonoscopy is an examination of your entire large bowel using a device called a colonoscope, which is like a sigmoidoscope but a bit longer. \n Your bowel needs to be empty when a colonoscopy is performed, so you will be advised to eat a special diet for a few days beforehand and take a  laxative  (medication to help empty your bowel) on the morning of the examination. \n You will be given a sedative to help you relax during the test, after which the doctor will insert the colonoscope into your rectum and move it along the length of your large bowel. This is not usually painful, but can feel uncomfortable. \n The camera relays images to a monitor, which allows the doctor to check for any abnormal areas within the rectum or bowel that could be the result of cancer. As with a sigmoidoscopy, a biopsy may also be performed during the test. \n A colonoscopy usually takes about\u00a0an hour to complete, and most people can go home once they have recovered from the effects of the sedative. \n After the procedure, you will probably feel drowsy for a while, so you will need to arrange for someone to accompany you home. It is best for elderly people to have someone with them for 24 hours after the test. You will be advised not to drive for 24 hours. \n In a small number of people, it may not be possible to pass the colonoscope completely around the bowel, and it is then necessary to have CT colonography. \n Find out more about what\u00a0a  colonoscopy  involves \n CT colonography \n CT colonography, also known as a \"virtual colonoscopy\", involves using a  computerised tomography (CT) scanner  to produce three-dimensional images of the large bowel and rectum. \n During the procedure, gas is used to inflate the bowel using a thin, flexible tube placed in your rectum. CT scans are then taken from a number of different angles. \n As with a colonoscopy, you may need to have a special diet for a few days and take a laxative before the test to ensure your bowels are empty when the test is carried out. \n This test can help identify potentially cancerous areas in people who are not suitable for a colonoscopy\u00a0because of\u00a0other medical reasons. \n A CT colonography is a less invasive test than a colonoscopy, but you may still need to have colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy at a later stage so any abnormal areas can be removed or biopsied. \n Want to know more? \n \n Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland:  bowel cancer symptom checker  \n Beating Bowel Cancer:  diagnosis  \n Bowel Cancer Information:  hospital tests  \n Cancer Research UK:\u00a0 bowel cancer tests  \n Macmillan:\u00a0 diagnosing colon cancer \u00a0 \n \n Further tests \n If a diagnosis of bowel cancer is confirmed, further testing is usually carried out to check if the cancer has spread from the bowel to other parts of the body.\u00a0These tests also help your doctors decide on the most effective treatment for you. \n These tests can include: \n \n a CT scan of your abdomen and chest \u2013\u00a0this will check if the rest of your bowel is healthy and whether the cancer has spread to the liver or lungs \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0\u2013 this can provide a detailed image of the surrounding organs in people with cancer in the rectum \n \n Staging and grading \n Once the above examinations and tests have been completed, it should be possible to determine the stage and grade of your cancer. \n Staging refers to how far your cancer has advanced. Grading relates to how aggressive your cancer is\u00a0and how\u00a0likely it is\u00a0to spread. \n This is important, as it helps your treatment team choose the best way of curing or controlling the cancer. \n A number of different staging systems are used by doctors. A simplified version of one of the common systems used is outlined below. \n \n stage 1 \u2013 the cancer is still contained within the lining of the bowel or rectum \n stage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread beyond the layer of muscle surrounding the bowel and may have penetrated the surface covering the bowel or nearby organs \n stage 3 \u2013 the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes \n stage 4 \u2013 the cancer has spread beyond the bowel into another part of the body, such as the liver \n \n There are three grades of bowel cancer: \n \n grade 1 \u2013 a cancer that grows slowly and has a low chance of spreading beyond the bowel \n grade 2 \u2013 a cancer that grows moderately and has a medium chance of spreading beyond the bowel \n grade 3 \u2013 a cancer that grows rapidly and has a high chance of spreading beyond the bowel \n \n If you are not sure what stage or grade of cancer you have, ask your doctor."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Blood cancer", "introduction": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. \n Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The two main types of white blood cells are: \n \n lymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections \n myeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending\u00a0the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\u00a0 \n \n This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive\u00a0cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately: \n \n  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \n  chronic myeloid leukaemia  \n  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  \n \n Signs and symptoms of AML \n The\u00a0 symptoms of AML  usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include: \n \n pale skin \n tiredness \n  breathlessness  \n frequent infections \n unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or  nosebleeds  \n \n In more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding. \n Read more about the  complications of AML  \n Seeking medical advice \n You should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms\u00a0of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause,\u00a0these symptoms should be investigated. \n If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange  blood tests  to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment. \n Read more about  diagnosing AML  \n What causes AML? \n AML\u00a0occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones),\u00a0produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells. \n Blast cells don't have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can\u00a0lead to a\u00a0decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). \n It's not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. However,\u00a0a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include: \n \n previous\u00a0 chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy  \n exposure to very high levels of radiation (including previous radiotherapy\u00a0treatment) \n exposure to benzene\u00a0 \u2013 \u00a0a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke \n having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as  Down's syndrome  \n \n Read more about the  causes of AML  \n Who's affected \n AML\u00a0is a rare type of cancer, with around 2,600 people diagnosed with it\u00a0each year in the UK. \n The risk of developing AML increases with\u00a0age. It's\u00a0most common in people over 65. \n How AML is treated \n AML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed. \n Chemotherapy\u00a0is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). \n In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a\u00a0 bone marrow or stem cell transplant , to achieve a cure. \n Read more about  treating AML  \n Outlook \n The outlook for AML largely depends on the specific\u00a0type of AML you have,\u00a0as well as your\u00a0age and general health. \n There are many subtypes of AML, which are classified according to various features\u00a0 \u2013  \u00a0 such as the specific genetic changes in the leukaemia cells. Some types of AML\u00a0are more challenging to treat than others. \n Even if treatment is initially successful, there's still a significant risk that the condition will return at some point during the next few years. If this happens, treatment may need to be repeated. \n A number of medical trials have suggested that almost half of those aged under 60 diagnosed with AML will live for at least five years, and in some types of AML, such as acute promyeloid leukaemia (APML), around 85% will live for at least five years. \n In general, the outlook for children with AML tends to be better than that of adults diagnosed with the condition.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bowel incontinence", "introduction": "Bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It's also sometimes known as faecal incontinence. \n The experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. Some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. This is known as urge bowel incontinence. \n Other people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind. \n Some people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time. \n It's thought 1\u00a0in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. It can affect people of any age, although it's more common in elderly people. It's also more common in women than men. \n Why bowel incontinence happens \n Bowel incontinence is\u00a0a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition. \n Many cases are caused by  diarrhoea ,  constipation , or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus. \n It can also be caused by long-term conditions such as  diabetes ,  multiple sclerosis  and  dementia . \n Read more about the  causes of bowel incontinence . \n Seeking advice and treatment \n Bowel incontinence can be upsetting and hard to cope with, but treatment is effective and a cure is often possible, so make sure you see your GP. \n It's important to remember that: \n \n Bowel incontinence isn't something to be ashamed of \u2013 it's simply a medical problem that's no different from\u00a0diabetes or asthma. \n It can be treated \u2013 there's a wide range of successful treatments. \n Bowel incontinence isn't a normal part of ageing. \n It won't usually go away on its own \u2013 most people need treatment for the condition. \n \n If you don't want to see your GP, you can usually make an appointment at your local NHS continence service without a referral. These clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence. \n Read more about  diagnosing bowel incontinence . \n How bowel incontinence is treated \n In many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life. \n Treatment will often depend on the cause and how severe it is, but possible options include: \n \n lifestyle and dietary changes to relieve constipation or diarrhoea \n exercise programmes to strengthen the muscles that control the\u00a0bowel \n medication to control diarrhoea and constipation \n surgery, of which there are a number of different options \n \n  Incontinence products , such as anal plugs and disposable pads, can be used until your symptoms are better controlled. \n Even if\u00a0it isn't possible to\u00a0cure your\u00a0bowel incontinence, symptoms\u00a0should\u00a0improve significantly. \n Read more about  treating bowel incontinence .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Bowel incontinence is usually caused by a physical problem with the parts of the body that control the bowel. \n The\u00a0most common problems are: \n \n problems with the rectum \u2013\u00a0the rectum is unable to retain poo properly until it's time to go to the toilet \n problems with the sphincter muscles \u2013 the muscles at the bottom of the rectum don't work properly \n nerve damage \u2013\u00a0the nerve signals sent from the rectum don't reach the brain \n \n These problems are explained in more detail below. \n It's important to discuss any bowel problems with your GP as there's a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as  bowel cancer . \n Problems with the rectum \n Constipation \n  Constipation  is a leading cause of bowel incontinence. \n In cases of severe constipation, a large, solid stool can become stuck in the rectum. This is known as faecal impaction. The stool then begins to stretch the muscles of the rectum, weakening them. \n Watery stools can leak around the stool and out of the bottom, causing bowel incontinence. This is called overflow incontinence and\u00a0happens most commonly in elderly people. \n Repeated straining caused by constipation or faecal impaction can also lead to rectal prolapse, when part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your bottom. Rectal prolapse may also lead to bowel incontinence. \n Diarrhoea \n It's difficult for the rectum to hold liquid stools (diarrhoea), so people with  diarrhoea  (particularly recurring diarrhoea) can develop bowel incontinence. \n Conditions that can cause recurring diarrhoea include: \n \n  Crohn's disease  \u2013 inflammation of the digestive system \n  irritable bowel syndrome  \u2013 a condition that causes a range of digestive problems, such as diarrhoea and bloating \n  ulcerative colitis  \u2013 inflammation of the large bowel \n \n These conditions can also cause scarring of the rectum, which can lead to bowel incontinence. \n Haemorrhoids \n  Haemorrhoids  (piles) are enlarged blood vessels inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). Symptoms include discomfort, itching, bleeding or a lump hanging down outside of the anus. \n In severe cases, haemorrhoids may lead to bowel incontinence. \n Problems with the sphincter muscles \n The sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. Bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged. \n Childbirth is a common cause of damage to the sphincter muscles and a leading cause of bowel incontinence. During a vaginal birth, the sphincter muscles can become stretched and damaged, particularly as a result of a forceps delivery. Other causes include a large baby, the baby being born with the back of their head facing the mother's back (occipitoposterior position) and a long labour. \n Sphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery. \n Nerve damage \n Bowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. A nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles. \n Damage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including: \n \n  diabetes \u00a0 \n  multiple sclerosis  (a condition of the central nervous system) \n  stroke  \n spina bifida (birth defects that affect the development of the spine and nervous system) \n \n An injury to these nerves, such as a spinal injury, can also lead to bowel incontinence. \n Other health conditions \n In some cases, bowel incontinence may result from a health condition such as  dementia  or a severe learning disability that causes the person to lose bowel control. \n A physical disability can also make it difficult to get to the toilet in time.", "treatment": "Treatment for bowel incontinence depends on underlying cause and the pattern of your symptoms. \n Trying the least intrusive treatments first, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, is often recommended. \n Medication and surgery are usually only considered if other treatments haven't worked. \n The various treatments for bowel incontinence\u00a0are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Continence products \n You may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. Most continence products are available for free on the NHS. \n Anal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. An anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. However, they can be uncomfortable and they're not really a long term solution. \n If the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. Anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string. \n Disposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. They can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence. \n Single-use silicone inserts, which form a seal around the rectum until your next bowel movement, are also being investigated as a treatment option for moderate to severe bowel incontinence. \n Your local NHS continence service can offer help and advice about continence products, and you don't usually need a referral from your GP to make an appointment. These clinics are staffed by nurses who specialise in continence treatment. \n When you're out \n \n Wear trousers or skirts that are easy to undo and have elasticated waistbands rather than buttons. \n  Disability Rights UK \u00a0offers access to 9,000 disabled toilets around the UK with a  Radar NKS key .\u00a0The key costs \u00a34.50 and is only sold to people who require use of toilet facilities due to a disability or health condition. \n \n Dietary changes \n Bowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet. \n It may be beneficial\u00a0to keep a food diary to record the effect of your diet on your symptoms. \n Diarrhoea \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published dietary advice for managing diarrhoea in cases of irritable bowel syndrome. These guidelines can also be applied to people with diarrhoea associated with bowel incontinence. \n The advice from NICE includes the following: \n \n limit fibre intake from wholegrain breads, bran, cereals, nuts and seeds (except golden linseeds) \n avoid skin, pips and pith from fruit and vegetables \n limit fresh and dried fruit to 3\u00a0portions a day and\u00a0fruit juice to 1\u00a0small glass a day (make up the recommended \u20185\u00a0a day\u2019 with vegetables) \n limit how often you have fizzy drinks\u00a0and drinks containing caffeine \n avoid foods high in fat, such as chips, fast foods and burgers \n \n Constipation \n A high-fibre diet is usually recommended for most people with constipation-associated bowel incontinence. Your GP can tell you if a high-fibre diet is suitable for you. \n Fibre can soften stools, making them easier to pass. Foods that are high in fibre include: \n \n fruit and vegetables \n beans \n wholegrain rice \n wholewheat pasta \n wholemeal bread \n seeds, nuts and oats \n \n Drink plenty of fluids because this can help to soften your stools and make them easier to pass. \n Pelvic floor muscle training \n Pelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles. \n A therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. The goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened. \n You'll probably be required to carry out the exercises 3\u00a0times a day, for 6\u00a0to 8\u00a0weeks. After this time, you should notice an improvement in your symptoms. \n Exercises to try \n Check with your health professional before trying these at home. \n First, pretend you're trying to hold in a bowel movement. You should feel the muscles around your anus tighten. \n Next, sit, stand, or lie in a comfortable position with your legs slightly apart. \n \n Squeeze\u00a0your pelvic floor\u00a0muscles for as long as you can, then relax. Repeat 5\u00a0times. \n Squeeze the muscles as hard as you can, then relax. Repeat 5\u00a0times. \n Squeeze the muscles quickly, then relax. Repeat 5\u00a0times. \n \n If you find these exercises\u00a0too difficult, try fewer repetitions at first and build them up. If they get too easy, try doing more repetitions. You can do the exercises without anyone knowing about them, so they should be easy to fit into your daily routine. \n Bowel retraining \n Bowel retraining is a type of treatment for people with reduced sensation in their rectum as a result of nerve damage, or for those who have recurring episodes of constipation. \n There are 3\u00a0goals in bowel retraining: \n \n to improve the consistency of your stools \n to establish a regular time for you to empty your bowels \n to find ways of stimulating your bowels to empty themselves \n \n Changes to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above). \n Establishing a regular time to empty your bowels means\u00a0finding the most convenient time when you can\u00a0go to the toilet without being rushed. \n Ways to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. Some people find a hot drink and meal can help. Others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger. \n Biofeedback \n Biofeedback is a type of bowel retraining exercise that involves placing a small electric probe into your bottom. \n The sensor relays detailed information about the movement and pressure of the muscles in your rectum to an attached computer. \n You're then asked to perform a series of exercises designed to improve your bowel function. The sensor checks that you\u00a0are performing the exercises in the right way. \n Medication \n Medication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence. \n Loperamide\u00a0is a\u00a0medicine widely\u00a0used to treat diarrhoea. It works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. Loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time. \n  Laxatives \u00a0are used to treat constipation. They're a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. Bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended.\u00a0These help your stools to retain fluid. This means they're less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. \n Enemas or rectal irrigation \n Rectal irrigation or enemas\u00a0are used when bowel incontinence is caused by faecal impaction and other treatments have failed to remove the impacted stool from the rectum. \n These procedures involve\u00a0a small tube that is placed into your anus. A special solution is then used to wash out your rectum. \n Surgery \n Surgery is usually only recommended after all other treatment options have been tried. \n The main surgical treatments used on the NHS are sphincteroplasty and sacral nerve stimulation. Other treatments \u2013 such as tibial nerve stimulation, endoscopic heat therapy and artificial sphincter surgery \u2013 can also be used, but their availability on the NHS is limited. \n An operation called a  colostomy  is more widely available on the NHS, but it's only used if other treatments are unsuccessful. \n These treatments are outlined in more detail below. \n Sphincteroplasty \n A sphincteroplasty is an operation to repair damaged sphincter muscles. The surgeon removes some of the muscle tissue and the muscle edges are overlapped and sewn back together. This provides extra support to the muscles, which makes them stronger. \n Sacral nerve stimulation \n Sacral nerve stimulation is a treatment used for people with weakened sphincter muscles. \n Electrodes are inserted under the skin in the lower back and connected to a pulse generator. The generator releases pulses of electricity that stimulate the sacral nerves, which causes\u00a0the sphincter and pelvic floor muscles to work more effectively. \n At\u00a0first, the pulse generator is located outside your body. If the treatment is effective, the pulse generator will be implanted deep under the skin in your back. \n The most commonly reported complications of the procedure are infection at the site of surgery and technical problems with the pulse generator, which require additional surgery to correct. \n See the NICE guidelines on\u00a0 Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence . \n Tibial nerve stimulation \n Tibial nerve stimulation is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence. \n A fine needle is inserted into the tibial nerve just above the ankle and an electrode is placed on the foot.\u00a0A mild electric current is passed through the needle to stimulate the tibial nerve. It's not known exactly how this treatment works, but it's thought to work in a similar way to sacral nerve stimulation. \n NICE concludes that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works. \n See\u00a0the NICE guidelines on  Treating faecal incontinence by stimulating the tibial nerve . \n Injectable bulking agents \n Bulking agents, such as collagen or silicone, can be injected into the muscles of the sphincter and rectum to strengthen them. \n The use of bulking agents in this way is a fairly new technique, so there's little information about their long-term effectiveness and safety. \n You should discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment in full with your treatment team before deciding whether to proceed. \n See the NICE guidelines on\u00a0 Treating faecal incontinence with injectable bulking agents . \n Endoscopic heat therapy \n Endoscopic radiofrequency (heat) therapy is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence. \n Heat energy is applied to the sphincter muscles through a thin probe, to encourage scarring of the tissue. This helps tighten the muscles and helps to control bowel movements. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u00a0recently produced guidelines on this procedure.\u00a0NICE concluded that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works. \n As well as the uncertainties surrounding this procedure, it is also expensive. Therefore, it is usually only used on the NHS during clinical trials. \n See\u00a0the NICE guidelines on  Treating faecal incontinence using endoscopic radiofrequency therapy . \n Artificial sphincter \n An artificial sphincter may be implanted if you have bowel incontinence caused by a problem with your sphincter muscles. \n This operation involves placing a circular cuff under the skin around the anus.\u00a0The cuff is filled with fluid and sits tightly around the anus, keeping it closed. \n A tube is placed under the skin from the cuff to a control pump. In\u00a0men, the pump is placed near the testicles, in\u00a0women it\u2019s placed near the vagina. A special balloon is placed into the tummy, and this is\u00a0connected to the control pump by tubing that runs under the skin. \n The\u00a0pump\u00a0is activated by pressing a button located under the skin. This drains the fluid from the cuff into the balloon, so your anus opens and you\u00a0can pass stools. When you are finished, the fluid slowly refills the cuff and the anus closes. \n The use of an artificial sphincter is a\u00a0relatively new procedure, so there isn't much good-quality information about\u00a0its long-term effectiveness and safety. \n Possible problems\u00a0include infection, injury during surgery and the cuff becoming dislodged. In some cases, further surgery is required to correct problems. \n See the NICE guidelines on\u00a0 Treating faecal incontinence with an artificial sphincter inserted through a cut in the abdomen . \n Colostomy \n A\u00a0 colostomy  is usually only recommended if other surgical treatments are unsuccessful. \n A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which your colon (lower bowel) is cut and brought through the wall of your stomach to create an artificial opening. Your stools can then be collected in a bag, known as a colostomy bag, which is attached to the opening.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will begin by asking you about the pattern of your symptoms and other related issues, such as your diet. \n You may find this embarrassing, but it's important to answer as honestly and fully as you can to\u00a0make sure\u00a0you receive the most suitable treatment. Let your doctor know about: \n \n any changes in your bowel habits\u00a0lasting for more than a few weeks \n rectal bleeding \n stomach pains \n any\u00a0changes to\u00a0your diet \n any medication you're taking \n \n Your GP will usually carry out a physical examination. They'll look at your anus and the surrounding area to check for damage and carry out\u00a0a rectal examination,\u00a0inserting\u00a0a gloved finger into your bottom. \n A rectal examination\u00a0will show whether constipation is the cause, and check for\u00a0any tumours in your rectum. Your GP may ask you to squeeze your rectum around their finger to assess how well the muscles in your anus are working. \n Depending on the results, your GP may refer you for further tests. \n Further tests \n Endoscopy (sigmoidoscopy) \n During an\u00a0endoscopy, the inside of your rectum (and in some cases your lower bowel) is examined using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end (endoscope). Images can also\u00a0be taken of the inside of your body. \n The endoscope\u00a0checks whether there's any obstruction, damage or inflammation in your rectum. \n An\u00a0endoscopy isn't painful, but\u00a0it can feel uncomfortable, so you may be given a sedative to relax you. \n Anal manometry \n Anal manometry helps to assess how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working. \n The test uses a device that looks like a small thermometer with a balloon attached to the end.\u00a0It's inserted into your rectum and the balloon is inflated. It may feel unusual, but it's not uncomfortable or painful. \n The device is attached to a machine, which measures pressure readings taken from the balloon. \n You'll be asked to squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles at certain times. You may also be asked to push the balloon out of your rectum in the same way you push out a stool. The pressure-measuring machine gives an idea of how well your muscles are working. \n If the balloon is inflated to a relatively large size but you don't feel any sensation of fullness, it may mean there are problems with the nerves in your rectum. \n Ultrasound \n An\u00a0 ultrasound scan  can be used to create a detailed picture of the inside of your anus. Ultrasound scans are particularly useful in detecting underlying damage to the sphincter muscles. \n Defecography \n Defecography is a test used to study\u00a0how you\u00a0pass stools. It can also be useful in detecting signs of obstruction or  prolapse  that haven't been discovered during a rectal examination. \n During this test, a liquid called barium is placed into your rectum. The barium helps make it easier to\u00a0highlight problems using an  X-ray . Once the barium is in place, you'll be asked to pass stools in the usual way while scans are taken. \n This test is occasionally carried out using a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner  instead of an X-ray."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bone cancer", "introduction": "Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones. Around 550 new cases are diagnosed each year in the UK. \n This is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body. \n These pages only refer to primary bone cancer. The Macmillan Cancer Support website has more information about  secondary bone cancer . \n Signs and symptoms of bone cancer \n Bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms. \n The main symptoms include: \n \n persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night \n swelling and redness (inflammation)\u00a0over a bone, which can make movement difficult if\u00a0the affected\u00a0bone is near a joint \n a noticeable lump over a bone \n a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal \n \n If you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening\u00a0bone pain, visit your GP. While it's highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation. \n Read more about the  symptoms of bone cancer  \n Types of bone cancer \n Some of the main types of bone cancer are: \n \n osteosarcoma \u2013 the most common type, which mostly affects children and\u00a0young adults under 20 \n  Ewing sarcoma \u00a0\u2013 which most commonly affects people aged between 10\u00a0and 20 \n chondrosarcoma \u2013 which tends to affect adults aged over 40 \n \n Young people can be affected because\u00a0the rapid growth spurts that occur during\u00a0puberty\u00a0may make bone tumours develop. \n The above\u00a0types of bone cancer\u00a0affect different types of\u00a0cell. The treatment and outlook will depend on the type of bone cancer you have. \n What causes bone cancer? \n In most cases, it's not known why a person develops bone cancer. \n You're more at risk\u00a0of developing it if you: \n \n have had previous exposure to\u00a0radiation\u00a0during\u00a0 radiotherapy  \n have a condition known as  Paget\u2019s disease of the bone  \u2013 however, only a very small number of people with Paget\u2019s disease will actually develop bone cancer \n have a rare genetic condition called\u00a0Li-Fraumeni syndrome\u00a0\u2013\u00a0people with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that normally helps stop the growth of cancerous cells \n \n Read more about the  causes of bone cancer  \n How bone cancer is treated \n Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread. \n Most people have a combination of: \n \n surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone \u2013 it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed,\u00a0but\u00a0 amputation \u00a0is sometimes necessary \n  chemotherapy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0treatment\u00a0with powerful cancer-killing medication \n  radiotherapy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where\u00a0radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells \n \n In some cases of\u00a0osteosarcoma,\u00a0a medication called mifamurtide may also\u00a0be recommended. \n Read more about  treating bone cancer  \n Outlook \n The outlook for bone cancer depends on\u00a0factors such as\u00a0your age, the type of bone cancer you have, how far the cancer has spread (the stage), and how likely it is to spread further (the grade). \n Generally, bone cancer is much easier to cure in otherwise healthy people whose cancer hasn't spread. \n Overall, around 6 in every 10 people with bone cancer will live for at least 5 years from the time of their diagnosis, and many of these may be cured completely. \n For more detailed statistics broken down by the different types of bone cancer, see the\u00a0page on  statistics and outlook for bone cancer  on the Cancer Research UK website.", "symptoms": "Bone pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. Some people experience other symptoms as well. \n Bone pain \n Pain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This\u00a0gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting. \n Any bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms. \n The\u00a0pain can sometimes be\u00a0wrongly mistaken for\u00a0 arthritis  in adults and growing pains\u00a0in children and teenagers. \n Other symptoms \n Some people\u00a0also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or\u00a0notice a lump on or around the affected bone. If the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint. \n In some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily\u00a0after a minor injury or  fall . \n Less common symptoms can include: \n \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n unexplained weight loss \n sweating, particularly\u00a0at night \n \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you or your child experiences persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, or if you're worried about any of the symptoms mentioned above. \n While it's highly unlikely that your symptoms are caused by cancer, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis. \n Read more about  diagnosing bone cancer", "causes": "Cancer occurs when the cells in a certain area of your body divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour. \n The exact reason why this happens is often not known, but certain things can increase your chance of developing the condition, including: \n \n previous\u00a0 radiotherapy  treatment \n other\u00a0bone conditions, such as\u00a0 Paget\u2019s disease of the bone  \n rare genetic conditions, such as\u00a0Li-Fraumeni syndrome \n a history of\u00a0certain\u00a0other\u00a0conditions, including  retinoblastoma \u00a0and  umbilical hernia  \n \n These risk factors are described in more detail below. \n Radiotherapy treatment \n Previous exposure to high doses of radiation\u00a0during  radiotherapy \u00a0may cause cancerous changes in your bone cells at a later stage, although this risk is thought to be small. \n Bone conditions \n Some non-cancerous (benign) conditions affecting the bones may increase your chances of developing bone cancer, although the risk is still small. \n In particular, a condition called Paget\u2019s disease of the bone\u00a0can increase the risk of bone cancer in people over 50-60 years of age. \n Rarer conditions that cause tumours to grow in your bones, such as Ollier's disease, can also increase your risk of bone cancer. \n Genetic conditions \n A rare genetic condition called\u00a0Li-Fraumeni syndrome can increase your risk of developing bone cancer, as well as several other types of cancer. \n People with this condition have a faulty version of a gene that usually helps stop the growth of tumours in the body. \n Other conditions \n People who had a rare type of eye cancer called retinoblastoma\u00a0as a child may be more likely to develop bone cancer, because the same inherited faulty gene can be responsible for both conditions. \n Research has also found that babies born with an umbilical hernia\u00a0are three times more likely to develop a type of bone cancer called Ewing sarcoma,\u00a0although the risk is still\u00a0very small.", "treatment": "Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have, how far it has spread and your general health. The main treatments are surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. \n Your treatment plan \n Your treatment should be managed by a specialist centre with experience in treating bone cancer, where you'll be cared for by a team of different healthcare professionals known as a multi-disciplinary team (MDT). \n Members of the MDT will include an orthopaedic surgeon (a surgeon who specialises in bone and joint surgery), a clinical oncologist (a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer) and a specialist cancer nurse, among others. \n Your MDT will recommend what they think is the best treatment for you, but the final decision will be yours. \n Your recommended treatment plan may include a combination of: \n \n surgery to remove the section of cancerous bone \u2013 it's often possible to reconstruct or replace the bone that's been removed, although  amputation \u00a0is occasionally necessary \n  chemotherapy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0treatment\u00a0with powerful cancer-killing medication \n  radiotherapy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where\u00a0radiation is used to destroy cancerous cells \n \n In some cases, a medication called mifamurtide may be recommended as well. \n Surgery \n Surgery to remove the cancerous area of bone is an important part of treatment for bone cancer, although it's often combined with the other treatments mentioned below. \n Nowadays, it's usually possible to avoid removing an affected body part completely (known as limb-sparing surgery), although up to 1 in every 10 people may need to have a limb permanently removed (amputation). \n Limb-sparing surgery \n Limb-sparing surgery is usually possible when the cancer has not spread beyond the bone, and the bone can be reconstructed. \n The most common type of limb-sparing surgery involves removing the section of affected bone and some of the surrounding tissue (in case any cancerous cells have spread into the tissue). \n The removed section of bone\u00a0may then be\u00a0replaced with a metal implant called a prosthesis or a piece of bone from elsewhere in your body (bone graft). \n If the cancer is near a joint, such as the knee, it may be\u00a0possible to remove the joint and replace it with an artificial one. Read more about\u00a0 knee joint replacement  and hip joint replacement. \n Amputation \n Amputation\u00a0may be necessary if limb-sparing surgery is not possible or has not worked well. For example, it may be necessary if: \n \n the cancer has spread beyond the bone into major blood vessels or nerves \n you developed an infection after limb-sparing surgery and the prosthesis or bone graft had to be removed\u00a0 \n the cancer has developed in a part of the body where limb-sparing surgery is not technically possible, such as the ankle \n \n Your care team will understand the shock and fear that you, or your child, may be feeling if an amputation is needed and should be able to provide you with\u00a0counselling and other support. In some cases, your care team may be able to introduce you to someone who has already had an amputation. \n After an amputation, most people use an artificial limb to replace the limb that's removed. These limbs are now very advanced and convenient to use. For example, people with an artificial leg are often able to walk, run and play sport, and have an excellent quality of life. \n Recovering from surgery \n After limb-sparing surgery or an amputation, you'll need help to return to normal life. This is known as rehabilitation. \n Rehabilitation will usually involve physiotherapy\u00a0sessions, where you carry out exercises to help regain proper function in the treated body part, and  occupational therapy , where you're taught skills to help you cope with day-to-day activities. \n After an amputation, you may be referred to a local limb centre for advice, support and rehabilitation treatment.\u00a0Read more about  living with an amputation . \n Chemotherapy \n There are four ways chemotherapy can be used to treat bone cancer. It can be used: \n \n before surgery, to shrink the tumour and make surgery easier \n in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation)\u00a0\u2013 this approach works particularly well in the treatment of\u00a0 Ewing sarcoma  \n after surgery, to prevent the cancer returning \n to control symptoms in cases where a cure is not possible (known as palliative chemotherapy) \n \n Chemotherapy for bone cancer involves taking a combination of different medications that are usually delivered via a drip into your vein, or into a line inserted into a bigger blood vessel. \n The\u00a0treatment is\u00a0usually given in cycles. A cycle involves taking the chemotherapy medication for several days, then having a break for a few weeks to allow your body to recover from the effects of the treatment. The number of cycles\u00a0you\u00a0need will depend on the type and grade of your bone cancer. \n Side effects \n Chemotherapy can damage healthy cells as well as cancerous cells, which means it often causes a number of side effects. \n Common side effects of chemotherapy include: \n \n nausea\u00a0and vomiting\u00a0 \n  diarrhoea  \n  mouth ulcers \u00a0 \n tiredness \n increased risk of catching infections \n temporary  hair loss  \n  infertility \u00a0 \n \n Most side effects associated with chemotherapy should resolve once your treatment has finished. However, there is a risk\u00a0you will be permanently infertile. Your care team will provide more detailed information about the specific risk to your fertility. \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy  \n Radiotherapy \n As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used before and after surgery to treat bone cancer, or used to control the symptoms and slow the spread of cancer when a cure is not possible. \n Radiotherapy for bone cancer involves beams of radiation being directed at the cancerous section of bone by an external machine. \n This is normally given in daily sessions, five days a week, with each session lasting a few minutes. The whole course of treatment will usually last a few weeks. \n Side effects \n The radiation you're exposed to during radiotherapy will mostly be focused on the cancerous cells, but healthy cells nearby can also be damaged. This can lead to\u00a0side effects such as: \n \n reddening and irritation of the skin (this can feel much like sunburn) \n joint pain in the part of the body that is being treated \n feeling sick \n hair loss in the body part being treated \n tiredness \n \n These side effects will pass once the radiotherapy has been completed, although feelings of tiredness may persist for several weeks. \n Read more about the  side effects of radiotherapy  \n Mifamurtide \n For people with a type of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, a medication called mifamurtide may be used alongside the treatments described above. \n Mifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant. This means it works by encouraging the immune system to produce specialised cells\u00a0that kill cancerous cells. \n It's normally recommended for young people with\u00a0high-grade osteosarcomas and is given\u00a0after surgery, in combination with chemotherapy, to help prevent the cancer returning. \n Mifamurtide is slowly pumped into one of your veins over the course of an hour (known as infusion). The recommended course of treatment is usually twice a week for 12 weeks, and then once a week for a further 24 weeks. \n Side effects \n Mifamurtide can cause a wide range of side effects. These can include: \n \n nausea and vomiting\u00a0 \n diarrhoea or\u00a0 constipation  \n  headache \u00a0 \n dizziness \n loss of appetite \n tiredness and weakness \n \n It's unclear whether it's safe to take mifamurtide during pregnancy, so as a precaution it's important\u00a0to\u00a0use an effective method of contraception if you're a sexually active woman. You will need to tell your MDT as soon as possible if you\u00a0think you're\u00a0pregnant, and you should avoid breastfeeding while taking mifamurtide. \n Follow-up \n Once your treatment has finished, you'll need to attend regular follow-up appointments to check\u00a0the cancer hasn't returned. \n You'll be asked to attend frequent appointments in the first two years after treatment has finished \u2013 possibly every\u00a0three months.\u00a0These will\u00a0become less frequent as the years go on. \n Contact your specialist or GP if you develop\u00a0 symptoms of bone cancer  again and think the cancer may have come back.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you're experiencing bone pain, your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine the affected area, before deciding whether you need to have any further tests. \n They will look for any swelling or lumps, and ask if you have\u00a0problems moving the affected area. They may ask about the type of pain you experience \u2013 whether it's constant or comes and goes, and whether anything makes it worse. \n After being examined, you may be\u00a0referred for an\u00a0 X-ray  of the affected area to look for any problems in the bones. If the X-ray shows abnormal areas, you'll be referred to\u00a0an orthopaedic surgeon (a specialist in bone conditions) or bone cancer specialist\u00a0for a further assessment. \n Some of the tests you may have to help diagnose and assess bone cancer are described below. \n X-rays \n An X-ray\u00a0is a procedure where radiation is used to\u00a0produce images of the inside of the body. It's a particularly effective way of looking at bones. \n X-rays can often detect damage to the bones caused by cancer, or new bone that's growing because of cancer.\u00a0They can also determine whether your symptoms are\u00a0caused by\u00a0something else, such as a broken\u00a0bone (fracture). \n If\u00a0an X-ray suggests you may have bone cancer, you should be referred to a specialist centre with expertise in diagnosing and treating the condition. As bone cancer is\u00a0rare,\u00a0there are a\u00a0small number of specialist centres, so you may have to travel outside your local area for advice and treatment. \n Biopsy \n The most definitive way of diagnosing bone cancer is to take a sample of affected bone and send it to a laboratory for testing. This is known as a  biopsy . \n A biopsy can determine exactly what type of bone cancer you have and what grade it is (see below). \n A biopsy can be\u00a0carried out\u00a0in two ways: \n \n A core needle biopsy is\u00a0performed under anaesthetic (depending on where the bone is located, this could be a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  or  general anaesthetic ).\u00a0A thin needle is inserted into the bone and used to remove a sample of tissue. \n An open biopsy is\u00a0performed under a general anaesthetic. The surgeon makes an incision in the affected bone to remove a sample of tissue. \n \n You may need to have an open biopsy if the results of a core needle biopsy are inconclusive. \n Further tests \n If the results of the biopsy confirm or suggest bone cancer, it's likely you'll have further tests to assess how far the cancer has spread. These tests are described below. \n MRI scan \n A\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the bones and soft tissues. \n An MRI scan is an effective way of assessing the size and spread of any cancerous tumour in or around the bones. \n CT scan \n A\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan  involves taking a series of X-rays and using a computer to reassemble them into a detailed three-dimensional (3-D) image of your body. \n CT scans are often used to check if the cancer has spread to your lungs. Chest X-rays may also be taken for this purpose. \n Bone scans \n A bone scan can\u00a0give more detailed information about the inside of your bones than an X-ray. During a bone scan,\u00a0a small amount of radioactive material is injected into your veins. \n Abnormal areas of bone will absorb the material at a faster rate than normal bone and will show up as \"hot spots\" on the scan. \n Bone marrow biopsy \n If you have a type of bone cancer called  Ewing sarcoma , you may have a test called a bone\u00a0marrow biopsy to check if the cancer has spread to the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones). \n During the test,\u00a0a needle is inserted into your bone to remove a sample of your bone marrow. This may be done under either local or general anaesthetic. \n Staging and grading \n Once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you what stage and grade the bone cancer is. Staging is a description of how far a cancer has spread and grading is a description of how quickly the cancer is likely to spread in the future. \n A widely used staging system for bone cancer in\u00a0the UK\u00a0uses three main stages: \n \n Stage 1 \u2013 the cancer is low-grade and has not spread beyond the bone \n Stage 2 \u2013 the cancer has still not spread beyond the bone, but is a high-grade \n Stage 3 \u00a0\u2013 the cancer has spread into other parts of the body, such as the lungs \n \n Most cases of stage 1 bone cancer and some stage 2 bone cancers have a good\u00a0chance of being cured. Unfortunately, stage 3 bone cancer is more difficult to cure, although treatment can relieve symptoms and slow the spread of the cancer. \n Coping with a diagnosis \n Being told\u00a0you have bone cancer can be a distressing and frightening experience. Receiving that type of news can be upsetting at any age, but can be particularly difficult if you are still in your teenage years, or\u00a0if you're a parent of a child who has just been told\u00a0they have bone cancer. \n These types of feelings can cause considerable stress and anxiety, which in some cases can trigger\u00a0 depression . If you think you may be depressed,\u00a0your GP may be a good person to talk to about support and possibly\u00a0treatment. \n You may also find it useful to contact the  Bone Cancer Research Trust , which is the UK\u2019s leading charity for people affected by bone cancer, if you need more information. If you're a teenager you may want to contact the  Teenage Cancer Trust , which is a charity for teenagers and young adults affected by cancer.\u00a0 \n Read more about  coping with a cancer diagnosis"},

There are different types of bone cancer, and most of this information applies to all types. If you have a rare type of bone cancer and want to know more, you could  talk to Macmillan . \n If you're looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0 bone cancer  section. \n Types of bone cancer \n There are different types of bone cancer. The two most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. \n  Osteosarcoma  \n Osteosarcomas are most likely to affect bones in the leg, especially around the knee joint, but they can affect any bone. \n  Ewing sarcoma  \n Ewing sarcoma can affect any bone, but it\u2019s most common in the pelvis (which is made up of the tail bone and the two hip bones), or in leg bones. Ewing sarcoma can sometimes start outside the bone in the soft tissue. This is called soft tissue Ewing sarcoma, and is treated in the same way.   Sarcoma is the name for a cancer that starts in any connective tissue, such as muscle, fat or cartilage. \n In this information we sometimes use the term \u2018bone tumour\u2019. This means the same as bone cancer. \n Causes \n We don\u2019t know what causes bone cancer. Because it\u2019s more common in young people, doctors think that it may be linked to the changes that happen when bones are growing. There is lots of ongoing research into the possible causes. \n People often think a knock or injury might have caused bone cancer, but there\u2019s no evidence for this. \n Remember that nothing you\u2019ve done has caused the cancer. \n Signs and symptoms of bone cancer \n Bone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. Many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains. \n The main symptoms are: \n \n pain\u00a0or tenderness. This may start as an ache that doesn\u2019t go away. It may be made worse by exercise or feel worse at night. If bone pain at night doesn\u2019t get better, it\u2019s important to get this checked out by your GP.\u00a0 \n swelling around the affected area of bone. Swelling may not show up until the tumour is quite large. It isn\u2019t always possible to see or feel a lump if the affected bone is deep inside the body.\u00a0 \n reduced movement. If the bone tumour is near a joint (like an elbow or knee), it can make it harder to move the joint. If it\u2019s in a leg bone, it may cause a limp. If it\u2019s in the backbone (spine), it may press on nerves and cause tingling and numbness in the legs or arms.\u00a0 \n a\u00a0broken bone. A bone may break suddenly, or after only a minor fall or accident. This can happen\u00a0if the bone has been weakened by cancer. \n \n There might also be other symptoms: \n \n tiredness\u00a0 \n a\u00a0high temperature\u00a0 \n loss of appetite\u00a0 \n weight loss \n \n If you have any of these symptoms, or you are worried that you may have a bone tumour, you should get it checked by your GP. They can talk to you about your symptoms, and arrange\u00a0 tests \u00a0if they feel they\u2019re needed. \n Remember - most people with the symptoms listed here won\u2019t have bone cancer.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

If your GP practice is closed, phone the 111 service. \n If sepsis is suspected, you'll usually be referred to hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. \n Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone in your care has one of these conditions, go straight to A&amp;E or\u00a0call 999.\u00a0 \n Tests to diagnose\u00a0sepsis \n Sepsis is often diagnosed based on simple measurements such as your temperature, heart rate and breathing rate. You may need to give a  blood test . \n Other tests\u00a0can help determine the type of infection, where it's located and which body functions have been affected. These\u00a0include: \n \n urine or stool\u00a0samples \n a wound culture\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small sample of tissue, skin or fluid is taken from the affected area for testing \n respiratory secretion testing\u00a0\u2013\u00a0taking a sample of saliva, phlegm or mucus \n blood pressure tests \n imaging studies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as an\u00a0 X-ray ,\u00a0 ultrasound scan \u00a0or  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \n \n Treatments for sepsis \n If sepsis is detected early\u00a0and hasn't affected vital organs yet, it may be possible to treat the infection at home with\u00a0 antibiotics . Most people who have sepsis detected at this stage make a full recovery. \n Almost all people with severe sepsis and septic shock require admission to hospital. Some people\u00a0may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). \n Because\u00a0of\u00a0problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill and the condition can be\u00a0fatal. \n However, sepsis is treatable\u00a0if it is\u00a0identified and treated quickly, and in most cases leads to a full recovery with no lasting problems. \n Read more\u00a0about  treating sepsis . \n Recovering from sepsis \n Some people make a full recovery fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies, depending on: \n \n the severity of the sepsis \n the person's overall health \n how much time was spent in hospital \n whether treatment was needed in an ICU \n \n Some people experience long-term physical and/or psychological problems during their recovery period, such as: \n \n feeling lethargic or excessively tired \n muscle weakness \n swollen limbs or joint pain \n chest pain or breathlessness \n \n These long-term problems are known as  post-sepsis syndrome . Not everyone experiences these problems. \n Who's at risk? \n Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection, although some people are more vulnerable. \n People most at risk of sepsis include those: \n \n with a medical condition or receiving medical treatment that weakens their immune system \n who are already in hospital with a serious illness \n who are very young or very old \n who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident \n \n Read more about the  causes of sepsis . \n Sepsis, septicaemia and blood poisoning \n Although sepsis is often referred to as either blood poisoning or septicaemia, these terms refer to the\u00a0invasion of bacteria into the bloodstream. \n Sepsis can affect multiple organs or the entire body,\u00a0even without blood poisoning or septicaemia. \n Sepsis can also be caused by viral or fungal infections, although bacterial infections are by far the most common cause.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Sepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. The most common sites of infection leading to sepsis are the lungs, urinary tract, tummy (abdomen) and pelvis.  \n Sepsis may develop when you're already in hospital. For example, you're more likely to develop sepsis if: \n \n you've recently had surgery \n you've had a\u00a0 urinary catheter  fitted \n you have to stay in hospital for a long time \n \n  Sources of infection  \n  What causes the symptoms of sepsis?  \n  People at risk  \n Sources of infection \n Types of infection associated with sepsis include: \n \n lung infection  (pneumonia)  \n  appendicitis  \n an infection of the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen (peritonitis) \n an infection of the bladder, urethra or kidneys  (urinary tract infection)  \n an infection of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or bile ducts (cholangitis) \n skin infections, such as\u00a0 cellulitis \u00a0\u2013\u00a0this can be caused by an intravenous\u00a0 catheter  that's been inserted through the skin to give fluids or medication \n infections after\u00a0surgery \n infections of the brain and nervous system\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0 meningitis  or encephalitis \n  flu  (in some cases) \n bone infection (osteomyelitis) \n heart infection  (endocarditis)  \n \n Sometimes the specific infection and source of sepsis can't be identified. \n What causes the symptoms of sepsis? \n Usually, your immune system keeps\u00a0an infection limited to one place. This is\u00a0known as a localised infection. \n Your body produces white blood cells, which travel to the site of the infection to destroy the germs causing infection. \n A series of biological processes occur, such as tissue swelling, which helps fight the infection and prevents it spreading. This process is known as inflammation. \n If your immune system is weak or an infection is particularly severe, it can quickly spread through the blood into other parts of the body. This causes the immune system to go into overdrive, and the inflammation affects the entire body. \n This can cause more problems than the initial infection, as widespread inflammation damages tissue and interferes with blood flow. \n The interruption in blood flow leads to a dangerous drop in blood pressure, which stops oxygen reaching your organs and tissues. \n People at risk \n Everybody is potentially at risk of developing sepsis from minor infections. However, some people are more vulnerable, including people who: \n \n have a medical condition\u00a0that weakens their immune system\u00a0\u2013 such as\u00a0 HIV  or  leukaemia  \n are receiving medical treatment that weakens their immune system\u00a0\u2013 such as  chemotherapy \u00a0or long-term steroids \n are very young or very old \n are pregnant \n have a long-term health condition\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as  diabetes  \n have just had surgery, or\u00a0have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident \n are on mechanical ventilation\u00a0\u2013 where a machine is used to help you breathe \n have drips or catheters attached to their skin \n are genetically prone to infections \n \n Sepsis is a particular risk for people already in hospital because of another serious illness. \n Bacterial infections that can be caught in hospital, such as MRSA, tend to be more serious, as these bacteria have often developed a resistance to many commonly used\u00a0 antibiotics .", "treatment": "Treatment for sepsis varies, depending on the site and cause of the initial infection, the organs affected and the extent of any damage.  \n You'll usually be referred to hospital for diagnosis and treatment if you have possible early signs of sepsis. Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. \n Management of sepsis after admission to hospital usually involves three treatments and three tests, known as the \"sepsis six\". These should be initiated by the medical team within an hour of diagnosis. \n Treatment involves: \n \n giving\u00a0 antibiotics \u00a0\u2013\u00a0if the sepsis is detected early enough, this may be\u00a0a course of tablets you can finish taking at\u00a0home \n giving fluids intravenously \n giving oxygen if levels are low \n \n These treatments are described in more detail on this page. \n Tests will include: \n \n taking blood cultures\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to identify the type of bacteria causing sepsis \n taking a blood sample\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to assess the severity of sepsis \n monitoring your urine output\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to assess severity and kidney function \n \n  Emergency treatment  \n  Antibiotics  \n  Viral infections  \n  Intravenous fluids  \n  Oxygen  \n  Treating the source of infection  \n  Increasing blood pressure  \n  Other treatments  \n Emergency treatment \n You'll need emergency hospital treatment and may require admission to an\u00a0intensive care unit (ICU)\u00a0if: \n \n the sepsis is severe \n you develop\u00a0 septic shock \u00a0\u2013\u00a0when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level \n \n ICUs are able to support any affected body functions, such as breathing or blood circulation, while the medical staff focus on treating the infection. \n Because of\u00a0problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill. Up to 4 in every 10 people with the condition will die. \n Septic shock is even more serious, with an estimated 6 in every 10 cases proving fatal. \n However, sepsis is treatable\u00a0if it is\u00a0identified and treated quickly, and in most cases leads to full recovery with no lasting problems. \n Antibiotics \n The main treatment for sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock is  antibiotics . \n If you have severe sepsis and septic shock, antibiotics will be given directly into a vein (intravenously).\u00a0 \n Ideally, antibiotic treatment should start within an hour of diagnosis to reduce the risk of serious complications or death. \n Intravenous antibiotics are\u00a0usually\u00a0replaced by\u00a0tablets after\u00a0two to four days.\u00a0You may have to take them\u00a0for 7 to 10 days or longer, depending on the severity of your condition. \n Types of antibiotics \n There won't usually be time to wait until a specific type of infection has been identified, so broad-spectrum antibiotics\u00a0are given first.\u00a0 \n These are designed to work against a wide range of known infectious bacteria and usually cure most common infections. \n Once a specific bacterium has been identified, a more focused antibiotic can be used. \n Viral infections \n If the sepsis is caused by a virus, antibiotics won't work. Antibiotics\u00a0are usually\u00a0given anyway because it would be too dangerous to delay treatment until tests confirm the specific cause. \n With a viral infection, you'll need to wait until your immune system starts to tackle the infection, although antiviral medication may be given in some cases. \n Intravenous fluids \n If you have sepsis, your body needs increased amounts of fluid to prevent dehydration and kidney failure. \n You'll usually be given fluids intravenously during the first 24 to 48 hours after admission if you have severe sepsis or septic shock. \n It's important that the doctors know how much urine your kidneys are making when you have sepsis so they can spot signs of kidney failure. \n If you're admitted with severe sepsis or septic shock, you'll usually have a  catheter  inserted into your bladder to monitor your urine output. \n Oxygen \n Your body's oxygen demand goes up if you have sepsis. \n If you're admitted to hospital with sepsis and the level of oxygen in your blood is low, you'll usually be given oxygen. This is\u00a0either given\u00a0through a mask or tubes in your nostrils. \n Treating the source of infection \n If a source of the infection can be identified, such as an\u00a0abscess\u00a0or infected wound,\u00a0this will also need to be treated. \n For example, any pus may need to be drained away or, in more serious cases, surgery may be needed to remove the infected tissue and repair any damage. \n Increasing blood pressure \n Medications called vasopressors are used if you have  low blood pressure \u00a0caused by sepsis. \n Vasopressors are normally given intravenously while you're in an ICU. Extra fluids may also be given intravenously to help increase blood pressure. \n Other treatments \n You may also require additional treatments, such as: \n \n  corticosteroids \u00a0or insulin medication \n a\u00a0 blood transfusion  \n mechanical ventilation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a machine is used to help you breathe \n  dialysis \u00a0\u2013 where a machine filters your blood to copy the function of your kidneys \n \n These treatments\u00a0are mostly used in ICUs.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Binge eating", "introduction": "Binge eating is an eating disorder where a person feels compelled to overeat on a regular basis through regular binges. \n People who binge eat consume very large quantities of food over a short period of time, even when they are not hungry. \n Binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying \"special\" binge foods. \n In rare cases, people describe themselves as being in a \"dazed state\" during a binge \u2013 particularly binges during the night \u2013 and they are not able to recall what they ate. \n People who binge eat feel they have no control over their eating. They often binge in private because they feel embarrassed, guilty or disgusted with their behaviour after they have finished eating. \n Episodes of binge eating sometimes alternate with periods where the person cuts down on the amount of food they eat. \n This can lead to a vicious cycle that is difficult to break \u2013 where blood sugar levels rise and fall rapidly, and false messages are sent to the brain, which result in cravings for food when your body doesn't need it. \n Who is affected \n Anyone can be affected by binge eating. \n While the condition is slightly more common in women than men, the numbers of men and women affected are more equal than in other eating disorders, such as  anorexia nervosa . \n The condition tends to first develop in young adults, although many people do not seek help until they are in their 30s or 40s. \n It\u2019s estimated that there is around a\u00a01 in 30 to\u00a01 in 50 chance of a person developing binge eating disorder at some point during their life. \n Getting help \n Many people will occasionally binge on food \u2013 this doesn't necessarily mean you have a binge eating disorder. However, you should see your GP if you binge regularly and excessively, particularly if the binges are having an effect on your physical and/or mental health. \n Your GP\u00a0can diagnose the condition and\u00a0may be able to refer you to a specialist, such as a psychiatrist or a psychologist. \n Your GP will\u00a0ask you\u00a0about your eating habits and look for the following signs: \n \n you eat much faster than normal during a binge \n you eat until you feel uncomfortably full \n you eat a large amount of food when you are not hungry \n you eat alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you are consuming \n you have feelings of guilt, shame or disgust after binge eating \n \n People who regularly eat this way are likely to have a binge eating disorder. \n What causes binge eating? \n It's not clear what causes binge eating, but, like most eating disorders, it's seen as a way of coping with feelings of unhappiness and low self-esteem. \n Things that may increase your risk of developing problems with binge eating include: \n \n low self-esteem and a lack of confidence \n depression or anxiety \n feelings of stress, anger, boredom or loneliness \n dissatisfaction with your body and feeling under pressure to be thin \n stressful or traumatic events in your past \n a family history of eating disorders, which may be related to your genes \n differences in your brain or the level of hormones produced by your brain compared to people who don't binge eat \n \n Binge eating can sometimes develop following a strict diet, particularly if you skipped meals, cut\u00a0certain foods out\u00a0and didn't eat enough food. These are unhealthy ways to lose weight and may mean you're more likely to binge at another time.\u00a0\u00a0 \n How\u00a0binge eating is treated \n Binge eating is treatable and most people eventually get better with appropriate help and support. \n The main treatments are: \n \n self-help programmes \u2013 this may be individually with a book or online course, or as part of a self-help support group \n guided self-help (self-help supervised by regular contacts with a professional) \n specialist group intervention \n individual (one-to-one) psychological therapy\u00a0\u2013 such as  cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)  \n medication called\u00a0 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  \n \n These treatments can help you overcome the psychological issues associated with your binge eating, but they won't usually have a significant impact on your weight. \n If you are overweight, a healthcare professional may also draw up a weight loss plan to follow during treatment or after any psychological issues have been dealt with. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating\u00a0binge eating  \n Risks of binge eating \n Binge eating can be associated with serious psychological problems, including  depression  and anxiety disorders. These feelings can be made worse over time while the person is still binge eating. \n A common physical effect of binge eating is weight gain, which can lead to  obesity . This can put you at risk of a number of related physical health problems, some of which can be life-threatening. \n These include: \n \n  high cholesterol  and  high blood pressure \u00a0\u2013 which can increase your risk of  cardiovascular diseases , such as  coronary heart disease  and  stroke  \n  diabetes  \u2013 a long-term condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high \n  osteoarthritis  \u2013 a condition that causes pain and swelling in the joints \n some types of cancer\u00a0\u2013 such as  breast cancer  and  bowel cancer  \n \n Therefore, it's\u00a0important to seek help if you think you may have a binge eating problem, because you may need support to help you tackle both your psychological and physical problems.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "Binge eating disorders are usually treatable and most people will eventually get better with appropriate help and support. \n The main treatments are outlined below. \n Self-help programmes \n A self-help programme is often the first step towards recovery. There are many different types of self-help and it's important to find one that suits you. Your GP may be able to recommend a self-help book or self-help group that would be suitable. \n You can find information on self-help books from your local library or from the eating disorders charity  Beat , which also has information on finding self-help and support groups for eating disorders. \n If you are referred to a mental health professional for help, they might encourage you to work through a self-help book under their supervision. This is called \"guided self-help\". \n For some people, a self-help programme alone may be enough to help them overcome their eating problems. \n Psychological therapy \n You may also be referred for psychological therapy to help tackle the underlying problems that cause you to binge eat. \n The three main types of therapy used to help people who binge eat are: \n \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for binge eating disorder (CBT-BED) \u2013 a specially adapted type of CBT that involves talking to a therapist and working out new ways of thinking about situations, feelings and food \n an adapted form of dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) \u2013 therapy that mainly focuses on improving your ability to control and regulate your emotions \n interpersonal therapy (IPT) \u2013 therapy that focuses on relationship-based issues and how they may be influencing your eating habits \n \n These therapies can be very effective in helping people who binge eat, although it's not clear how long-lasting the results are. \n It\u2019s common to experience some periods where the problem improves (remission) and periods where they get worse (relapses), especially in the early stages of treatment. \n Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \n Some people may be prescribed a type of  antidepressant medication  called a  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  instead of, or in addition to, a self-help programme. \n SSRIs boost levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain, which may help lift your mood and lead to an improvement in your eating habits. However, the long-term effects of the treatment for binge eating are unknown. \n Common side effects of SSRIs include: \n \n feeling agitated, shaky or anxious \n feeling or being sick \n indigestion \n  diarrhoea  or  constipation  \n loss of appetite and weight loss \n dizziness \n blurred vision \n difficulty sleeping ( insomnia ) or feeling very sleepy \n low sex drive \n \n These side effects will often improve over time, although some can persist. \n Read more about the  side effects of SSRIs  \n Losing weight \n Although the treatments mentioned above won\u2019t address your weight directly, you may experience some weight loss if you are able to control your bingeing \u2013 particularly if you combine treatment with regular exercise. \n If you are struggling to lose weight, your GP or a weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian) will be able to draw up a weight loss plan that will provide you with the nutrition your body needs to be healthy, as well as helping you to lose weight. \n You may be advised to follow this plan alongside your other treatments, or after your psychological issues have been dealt with. \n Your plan may involve: \n \n keeping a food diary to see if there is any pattern to when you binge and to highlight the types of food you binge on \n having regular, planned meals and not skipping meals \n eating healthy snacks between meals to stop you getting hungry \n not depriving yourself of\u00a0specific foods \u2013 you may be encouraged to include some unhealthy foods in your eating plan to reduce your urge to binge on them \n having a balanced, calorie-controlled diet as recommended by your GP or other healthcare professional \n  exercising regularly  \u2013 most adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week \n \n It's important that you lose weight healthily.

Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer), and some people may not experience a \"normal\" mood very often. \n Depression \n You may initially be diagnosed with\u00a0 clinical depression  before having a future manic episode (sometimes years later), after which\u00a0you may be\u00a0 diagnosed with\u00a0bipolar disorder . \n During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of  suicide . \n If you're feeling suicidal or having severe depressive symptoms, contact your GP, care co-ordinator or local mental health emergency services as soon as possible. \n If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans, free of charge,\u00a0on 116 123.

You may spend large amounts of money on things you can't afford and wouldn't normally want. \n Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of this phase. \n You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience. However, you may also experience symptoms of\u00a0 psychosis , where you see or hear things that aren't there or become convinced of things that aren't true. \n Living with bipolar disorder \n The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life. \n However, there are several options for\u00a0 treating bipolar disorder  that can make a difference. They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible. \n The following treatment options are available: \n \n medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression\u00a0\u2013\u00a0these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis \n medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur \n learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania \n psychological treatment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships \n lifestyle advice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on\u00a0 improving your diet  and  getting more sleep  \n \n It's thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder. \n Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers\u00a0is also available\u00a0from charities, support groups and associations. \n This includes self-help and self-management advice, and learning to\u00a0deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition. \n Find out more about  living with bipolar disorder  \n Bipolar disorder and pregnancy \n Bipolar disorder, like all other mental health problems, can get worse during pregnancy. However, specialist help is available if you need it. \n What causes bipolar disorder? \n The exact\u00a0 cause of bipolar disorder \u00a0is unknown, although it's believed a number of things can trigger an episode. Extreme stress, overwhelming problems and life-changing events are thought to contribute, as well as genetic and chemical factors. \n Who's affected? \n Bipolar disorder is fairly common and one in every 100 adults will be diagnosed with the condition at some point in their life. \n Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19 and rarely develops after 40. Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to\u00a0develop bipolar disorder. \n The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely between people. For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and\u00a0are stable in between, while others have many episodes.", "symptoms": "Bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. These can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression). \n Episodes of mania and depression often last for several weeks or months. \n Depression \n During a period of depression, your symptoms may include: \n \n feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time \n lacking energy \n difficulty concentrating and remembering things \n loss of interest in everyday activities \n feelings of emptiness or worthlessness \n feelings of guilt and despair \n feeling pessimistic about everything \n self-doubt \n being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking \n lack of appetite \n difficulty sleeping \n waking up early \n suicidal thoughts \n \n Mania \n The manic phase of bipolar disorder may include: \n \n feeling very happy, elated or overjoyed \n talking very quickly \n feeling full of energy \n feeling self-important \n feeling full of great new ideas and having important plans \n being easily distracted \n being easily irritated or agitated \n being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking \n not feeling like sleeping \n not eating \n doing things that often have disastrous consequences \u2013\u00a0such as spending large sums of money on expensive and sometimes unaffordable items \n making decisions or saying things that are out of character and that others see as being risky or harmful \n \n Patterns of depression and mania \n If you have bipolar disorder, you may have episodes of depression more regularly than episodes of mania, or vice versa. \n Between episodes of depression and mania, you may sometimes have periods where you have a \"normal\" mood. \n The patterns aren't always the same and some people may experience: \n \n rapid cycling\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a person with bipolar disorder repeatedly swings from a high to low phase quickly without having a \"normal\" period in between \n mixed state\u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a person with bipolar disorder experiences symptoms of\u00a0depression and mania together; for example, overactivity with a depressed mood \n \n If your mood swings last a long time but aren't severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with cyclothymia\u00a0(a mild form of bipolar disorder). \n Living with bipolar disorder \n Bipolar disorder is a condition of extremes.\u00a0A person with the condition may be unaware they're in the manic phase. \n After the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. However, at the time, they may believe other people\u00a0are being negative or unhelpful. \n Some people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others.\u00a0The extreme nature of the condition means\u00a0staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. There's also an increased risk of  suicide . \n During episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren't there (hallucinations). \n They may also believe things that seem irrational to other people (delusions). These types of symptoms are known as\u00a0 psychosis  or a psychotic episode. \n Read more about\u00a0 living with bipolar disorder", "causes": "The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Experts believe there are a number of factors that work together to make a person more likely to develop the condition. \n These are thought to be a complex mix of physical, environmental and social factors. \n Chemical imbalance in the brain \n Bipolar disorder is widely believed to be the result of chemical imbalances in the brain. \n The chemicals responsible for controlling the brain's functions are called neurotransmitters and include\u00a0noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine. \n There's some evidence that if there's an imbalance in the levels of one or more neurotransmitters, a person may develop some\u00a0 symptoms of bipolar disorder . \n For example, there's evidence that episodes of mania may occur when levels of noradrenaline are too high, and episodes of depression may be the result of noradrenaline levels becoming too low. \n Genetics \n It's also thought bipolar disorder is linked to genetics, as the condition seems to run in families. The family members of a person with the condition have an increased risk of developing it themselves. \n However, no single gene is responsible for bipolar disorder. Instead, a number of genetic and environmental factors are thought to act as triggers. \n Triggers \n A stressful circumstance or situation often triggers the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Examples of stressful triggers include: \n \n the breakdown of a relationship \n physical, sexual or emotional abuse \n the death of a close family member or loved one \n \n These types of life-altering events can cause episodes of depression at any time in a person's life. \n Bipolar disorder may also be triggered by: \n \n physical illness \n sleep disturbances \n overwhelming problems in everyday life \u2013\u00a0such as problems with money, work or relationships", "treatment": "Treatment for bipolar disorder aims to reduce the severity and number of episodes of depression and mania to allow as normal a life as possible. \n Treatment options for bipolar disorder \n If a person isn't treated, episodes of bipolar-related\u00a0mania can last for between\u00a0three and\u00a0six months. Episodes of  depression  tend to last longer, for between\u00a0six and 12 months. \n However, with effective treatment, episodes usually improve within about\u00a0three months. \n Most people with bipolar disorder can be treated using a combination of different treatments. These can include one or more of the following: \n \n medication to prevent episodes of mania, hypomania (less severe mania) and depression \u2013 these are known as mood stabilisers and are taken every day on a long-term basis \n medication to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they occur \n learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania \n psychological treatment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as talking therapies, which help you deal with depression and provide advice on how to improve relationships \n lifestyle advice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, and advice on  improving your diet  and  getting more sleep  \n \n Read more about  living with bipolar disorder  \n Most people with bipolar disorder can receive most of their treatment without having to stay in hospital. \n However, hospital treatment may be needed if your symptoms are severe, or if you're being treated under the Mental Health Act, as there's a danger you may\u00a0self-harm or hurt others. \n In some circumstances,\u00a0you could have treatment in a day hospital and return home at night. \n Medication \n Several\u00a0medications are available to help stabilise mood swings. These are commonly referred to as mood stabilisers and include: \n \n lithium carbonate \n anticonvulsant medicines \n antipsychotic medicines \n \n If you're already taking medication for bipolar disorder and you develop depression, your GP will check you're taking the correct dose. If you aren't, they'll change it. \n Episodes of depression are treated slightly differently in bipolar disorder, as the use of antidepressants alone may lead to a hypomanic relapse. \n Most guidelines suggest depression in bipolar disorder can be treated with just a mood stabiliser. However, antidepressants are commonly used alongside a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic. \n Read more about  antidepressants  \n If your GP or psychiatrist recommends you stop taking medication for bipolar disorder, the dose should be gradually reduced over at least four weeks, and up to three months if you are taking an antipsychotic or lithium. \n If you have to stop taking lithium for any reason, see your GP about taking an antipsychotic or valproate instead. \n Lithium carbonate \n In the UK, lithium carbonate (often referred to as just lithium) is the medication most commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. \n Lithium is a long-term method of treatment for episodes of mania, hypomania and depression. It's usually prescribed for at least six months. \n If you're prescribed lithium, stick to the prescribed dose and don't stop taking it suddenly (unless told to by your doctor). \n For lithium to be effective, the dosage must be correct. If it's incorrect, you may get side effects such as diarrhoea and vomiting. However, tell your doctor immediately if you have side effects while taking lithium. \n You'll need regular blood tests at least every three months\u00a0while taking lithium.\u00a0This is\u00a0to make sure your lithium levels aren't too high or too low. \n Your kidney and thyroid function will also need to be checked every two\u00a0to\u00a0three months if the dose of lithium is being adjusted, and every 12 months in all other cases. \n While you're taking lithium, avoid using\u00a0 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as  ibuprofen , unless they're prescribed by your GP. \n In the UK, lithium and the antipsychotic medicine aripiprazole are currently the only medications licensed for use in\u00a0adolescents with bipolar disorder who are aged 13 or over. \n However, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health states that unlicensed medicines may be prescribed for children if there are no suitable alternatives and their use can be justified by expert agreement. \n Anticonvulsant medicines \n Anticonvulsant medicines include: \n \n valproate\u00a0 \n carbamazepine \n lamotrigine \n \n These medicines are sometimes used to treat episodes of mania. They're also long-term mood stabilisers. \n Anticonvulsant medicines are often used to treat  epilepsy , but they're also effective in treating bipolar disorder. \n A single anticonvulsant medicine may be used, or they may be used in combination with lithium\u00a0when the condition doesn't respond to lithium on its own. \n Valproate \n Valproate isn't usually prescribed for women of childbearing age because there's a risk of physical defects to babies such as spina bifida, heart abnormalities and cleft lip.\u00a0There may also\u00a0be an increased risk of developmental problems such as\u00a0lower intellectual abilities, poor speaking and understanding, memory problems, autistic spectrum disorders and delayed walking and talking. \n Learn more about the  risks of valproate medicines during pregnancy  \n In women, your GP may decide to use valporate if there's no alternative or if you've been assessed and it's unlikely you'll respond to other treatments, although they'll need to check you're using a reliable contraception and advise you on the risks of taking the medicine during pregnancy. \n If you're prescribed valproate, you'll need to visit your GP to have a blood count when you begin the medication, and then again six months later. \n Carbamazepine \n Carbamazepine is usually only prescribed on the advice of an expert in bipolar disorder. To begin with, the dose will be low and then gradually increased. \n Your progress will be carefully monitored if you're taking other medication, including the contraceptive pill. \n Blood tests to check your liver and kidney function will be carried out when you start taking carbamazepine, and again after six months. \n You'll also need to have a blood count at the start and after six months, and you may also have your weight and height monitored. \u00a0 \n Lamotrigine \n If you're prescribed lamotrigine, you'll usually be started on a low dose, which will be increased gradually. \n See your GP immediately if you're taking lamotrigine and develop a rash. You'll need to have an annual health check, but other tests aren't usually needed. \n Women who are taking the contraceptive pill should talk to their GP about taking a different method of contraception. \n Antipsychotic medicines \n Antipsychotic medicines are sometimes prescribed to treat episodes of mania or hypomania. Antipsychotic medicines include: \n \n aripiprazole \n olanzapine \n quetiapine \n risperidone \n \n They may also be used as a long-term mood stabiliser. Quetiapine may also be used\u00a0for long-term bipolar depression. \n Antipsychotic medicines can be particularly useful if symptoms are severe or behaviour is disturbed. As antipsychotics can cause side effects\u00a0\u2013 such as blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation and weight gain\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the initial dose will usually be low. \n If you're prescribed an antipsychotic medicine, you'll need to have regular health checks at least every three months, but possibly more often, particularly if you have diabetes. If your symptoms don't improve, you may be offered lithium and valproate as well. \n Aripiprazole is also recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as an option for treating moderate to severe manic episodes in adolescents with bipolar disorder. \n Rapid cycling \n You may be prescribed a combination of lithium and valproate if you experience rapid cycling (where you quickly change from highs to lows without a \"normal\" period in between). \n If this doesn't help, you may be offered lithium on its own or a combination of lithium, valproate and lamotrigine. \n However, you won't usually be prescribed an antidepressant unless an expert in bipolar disorder has recommended it. \n Learning to recognise triggers \n If you have bipolar disorder, you can learn to recognise the warning signs of an approaching episode of mania or depression. \n A community mental health worker, such as a psychiatric nurse, may be able to help you identify your early signs of relapse from your history. \n This won't prevent the episode occurring, but it will allow you to get help in time. \n This may mean making some changes to your treatment, perhaps by\u00a0adding an antidepressant or antipsychotic medicine to the mood-stabilising medication you're already taking. Your GP or specialist can advise you on this. \n Psychological treatment \n Some people find psychological treatment helpful when used alongside medication in between episodes of mania or depression. This may include: \n \n psychoeducation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0to find out more about\u00a0bipolar disorder \n  cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)  \u2013 this\u00a0is most useful when treating depression \n family therapy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a type of  psychotherapy  that focuses on family relationships (such as marriage) and encourages everyone within the family or relationship to work together\u00a0to improve mental health \n \n Psychological treatment usually consists of around 16 sessions. Each session lasts an hour and takes place over a period of six to nine months. \n Pregnancy \n The management of bipolar disorder in women who are  pregnant , or those who are trying to conceive, is complex and challenging. \n One of the main problems is the risks of taking medication during pregnancy aren't always that well understood. \n The National Institute\u00a0for\u00a0Health and\u00a0Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that the risks of treating or not treating women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy should be fully discussed. \n NICE also recommends that specialist mental health services work closely with maternity services. \n A written plan for managing the treatment of a pregnant woman with bipolar disorder should be developed as soon as possible. \n The plan should be drawn up with the patient, her partner, her obstetrician (pregnancy specialist), midwife, GP and health visitor. \n The following medication isn't routinely prescribed for pregnant women with bipolar disorder: \n \n valproate \u2013\u00a0there's a risk to the foetus and the subsequent development of the child \n carbamazepine \u2013\u00a0it has limited effectiveness and there's risk of harm to the foetus \n lithium \u2013\u00a0there's a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiac problems \n lamotrigine \u2013\u00a0there's a risk of harm to the foetus \n paroxetine \u2013\u00a0there's a risk of harm to the foetus, such as cardiovascular malformations \n benzodiazepines \u2013\u00a0if used long term, there are risks during the pregnancy and immediately after the birth, such as cleft palate and floppy baby syndrome \n \n If you become pregnant while taking medication prescribed to treat bipolar disorder, it's important that you don't stop taking it until you've discussed it with your doctor. \n If\u00a0medication is prescribed for bipolar disorder after the baby is born, it may also affect a mother's decision to breastfeed her child. Your pharmacist, midwife or mental health team can give you advice based on your circumstances.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If your GP thinks you may have bipolar disorder, they'll usually refer you to a psychiatrist (a medically qualified mental health specialist). \n If your illness puts you at risk of harming yourself, your GP will arrange an appointment immediately. \n Specialist assessment \n You'll be assessed by the psychiatrist at your appointment. They'll ask you a few questions to determine if you have bipolar disorder.\u00a0If you do, they'll decide what treatments are most suitable. \n During the assessment, you'll be asked about your symptoms and when you first experienced them. The psychiatrist will also ask about how you feel leading up to and during an episode of mania or depression, and if you have thoughts about harming yourself. \n The psychiatrist will also want to know about your medical background and family history, especially whether any of your relatives have had bipolar disorder. \n If someone else in your family has the condition, the psychiatrist may want to talk to them. However, they'll ask for your agreement before doing so. \n Other tests \n Depending on your symptoms, you may also need tests to see whether you have a physical problem, such as an\u00a0 underactive thyroid  or an  overactive thyroid . \n If you have bipolar disorder, you'll need to visit your GP regularly for a physical health check."},

In some cases, the tumour spreads into the surrounding muscles. \n The most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in your urine, which is usually painless. \n If you notice blood in your urine, even if it comes and goes, you should visit your GP, so the cause can be investigated. \n Read about the  symptoms of bladder cancer  \n Types of bladder cancer\u00a0 \n Once diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has\u00a0spread.\u00a0 \n If the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\u00a0This is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases.\u00a0Most people don't die as a result\u00a0of\u00a0this type of bladder cancer. \n When the cancerous cells spread beyond the lining, into the surrounding muscles of the bladder, it's referred to as muscle-invasive bladder cancer.\u00a0This is less common,\u00a0but has a higher chance\u00a0of spreading to other parts of the body and can be fatal. \n If bladder cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it's known as locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. \n Read more about  diagnosing bladder cancer  \n Why does bladder cancer happen? \n Most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder's cells over many years. \n Tobacco smoke is a common cause and\u00a0it's estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking. \n Contact with certain chemicals previously\u00a0used in manufacturing is also known to cause bladder cancer. However, these substances have since\u00a0been banned. \n Read more about the  causes of bladder cancer \u00a0and  preventing bladder cancer  \n Treating bladder cancer \n In cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it's usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact. \n This is done using a surgical technique called transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT).\u00a0This\u00a0is followed by a dose of chemotherapy medication directly into the bladder, to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. \n In cases with a higher risk of recurrence, a medication known as  Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)  may be\u00a0injected into the bladder to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. \n Treatment for high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, or muscle-invasive bladder cancer may involve surgically removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy. \n When the bladder is removed, you'll need another way of\u00a0collecting your urine. Possible options include making an opening in the abdomen so urine can be passed into an external\u00a0bag, or constructing a new bladder out of a section of bowel. This will be done at the same time as a cystectomy. \n If it's possible to avoid removing the bladder, or if surgery\u00a0is not suitable, a course of  radiotherapy \u00a0and\u00a0 chemotherapy  may be recommended. Chemotherapy may sometimes be used on its own before surgery or before being combined with radiotherapy. \n After treatment for all types of bladder cancer, you'll have regular follow-up tests to check for signs of recurrence. \n Read more about  treating bladder cancer  \n Who is affected? \n About 10,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer every year and it's the seventh most common cancer in the UK. \n The condition\u00a0is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new\u00a0cases diagnosed in people\u00a0aged 75 and above. \n Bladder cancer is also more common in men than in women, possibly because in the past, men were more likely to smoke and work in the\u00a0manufacturing industry.", "symptoms": "Blood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer. \n The medical name for this is haematuria\u00a0and it's usually painless. You may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. The blood isn't always noticeable and it may come and go. \n Less common symptoms of bladder cancer include: \n \n a need to urinate on a more frequent basis \n sudden urges to urinate \n a burning sensation when passing urine \n \n If bladder cancer reaches an advanced stage and begins to spread, symptoms can include: \n \n pelvic pain\u00a0 \n bone pain \n unintentional weight loss\u00a0 \n swelling of the legs \n \n When to seek medical advice \n If you ever have blood in your urine\u00a0\u2013 even if it comes and goes\u00a0\u2013 you should visit your GP, so the cause can be investigated. \n Having blood in your urine doesn't mean you definitely have bladder cancer. There are other, more common, causes including: \n \n a\u00a0 urinary tract infection ,\u00a0such as  cystitis  \n a  kidney infection  \n  kidney stones  \n  urethritis  \n an  enlarged prostate gland ,\u00a0in men", "causes": "Bladder cancer is caused by changes to the cells of the bladder. It's often linked with exposure to certain chemicals, but the cause isn't always known. \n What is cancer? \n Cancer begins with a change (mutation)\u00a0in the structure of the DNA in cells, which\u00a0can\u00a0affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. \n Increased risk \n Several\u00a0factors\u00a0have been identified that can significantly increase your risk of developing bladder cancer. \n Smoking \n Smoking is the single biggest risk factor for bladder cancer. This is because tobacco contains cancer-causing (carcinogenic) chemicals. \n If you smoke for many years, these chemicals pass into your bloodstream and are filtered by the kidneys\u00a0into your urine. The bladder is repeatedly exposed to these harmful chemicals, as it acts as a store for urine. This can cause changes to the cells of the bladder lining, which may\u00a0lead to bladder cancer. \n It's estimated that\u00a0just over a third\u00a0of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by\u00a0smoking. People who smoke may be up to\u00a0four times more likely to develop bladder cancer than non-smokers. \n Exposure to chemicals \n Exposure to certain industrial chemicals is the second biggest risk factor. Previous studies have estimated that this may account for around 25% of cases. \n Chemicals known to increase the risk of bladder cancer include: \n \n aniline dyes \n 2-Naphthylamine \n 4-Aminobiphenyl \n xenylamine \n benzidine \n o-toluidine \n \n Occupations\u00a0linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer are manufacturing jobs involving: \n \n dyes \n textiles \n rubbers \n paints \n plastics \n leather tanning \n \n Some non-manufacturing jobs have also been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. These include taxi or bus drivers, as a result of their regular exposure to the chemicals present in diesel fumes. \n The link between bladder cancer and these types of occupations was discovered in the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, regulations relating to exposure to cancer-causing chemicals have been made much more rigorous and many of the chemicals listed above\u00a0have been banned. \n However,\u00a0these chemicals are still\u00a0linked with cases of bladder cancer now, as it can take up to\u00a030 years after initial exposure to the chemicals before the condition starts to develop. \n Other risk factors \n Other\u00a0factors that can increase your risk of bladder cancer include: \n \n  radiotherapy  to treat previous cancers near the bladder, such as\u00a0 bowel cancer  \n previous treatment with\u00a0certain  chemotherapy  medications, such as\u00a0cyclophosphamide and cisplatin \n previous surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, during treatment for\u00a0 benign prostate enlargement  \n having diabetes \u2013 bladder cancer is thought to be linked to certain treatments for  type 2 diabetes  \n having a tube in your bladder (an indwelling catheter) for a long time, because you have nerve damage that has resulted in paralysis \n long-term or repeated\u00a0 urinary tract infections (UTIs)  \n long-term  bladder stones  \n having an early\u00a0 menopause  (before the age of 42) \n an untreated infection called  schistosomiasis , which is\u00a0caused by a parasite that\u00a0lives in fresh water\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is very rare in the UK \n \n How does bladder cancer spread? \n Bladder cancer usually begins in the cells of the bladder lining. In some cases, it\u00a0may spread into surrounding bladder muscle. If the cancer penetrates this muscle, it\u00a0can spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymphatic system. \n If bladder cancer spreads to other parts of the body, such as other organs, it's known as metastatic bladder cancer.", "treatment": "The treatment options for bladder cancer largely depend on how advanced the cancer is. \n Treatments usually differ\u00a0between early stage, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and more advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer. \n Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) \n All hospitals use MDTs to treat bladder cancer. These are teams of specialists that work together to make decisions about the best way to proceed with your treatment. \n Members of your MDT may include: \n \n a urologist\u00a0\u2013 a surgeon specialising in treating conditions affecting the urinary tract \n a clinical oncologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in chemotherapy and radiotherapy \n a pathologist\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a specialist in diseased tissue \n a radiologist\u00a0\u2013 a specialist in detecting disease using imaging techniques \n \n You should be given the contact details for a clinical nurse specialist, who will be in contact with all members of your MDT.\u00a0They'll be able to answer questions and support you throughout your treatment. \n Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your MDT will make recommendations, but remember that the final decision is yours.\u00a0 \n Before discussing your treatment options, you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask your MDT. \n Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer \n If you've been diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stages CIS, Ta and T1), your recommended treatment plan depends on the risk of the cancer returning or spreading beyond the lining of your bladder. \n This risk is calculated using a series of factors, including: \n \n the number of tumours present in your bladder \n whether the tumours are larger than 3cm (one inch) in diameter \n whether you've had bladder cancer before \n the grade of the cancer cells \n \n These treatments are discussed in more detail below. \n Low-risk \n Low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT). This procedure may be performed during your first cystoscopy, when tissue samples are taken for testing (see  diagnosing bladder cancer ). \n TURBT is carried out under  general anaesthetic . The surgeon uses an instrument called a cystoscope to locate the visible tumours and cut them away from the lining of the bladder. The wounds are sealed (cauterised) using a mild electric current, and you may be given a\u00a0 catheter  to drain any blood or debris from your bladder over the next few days. \n After surgery,\u00a0you\u00a0should be given a\u00a0single dose of\u00a0 chemotherapy , directly into your bladder,\u00a0using a catheter. The solution is kept in your bladder for around an hour before being drained away. \n Most people are able to leave hospital less than 48 hours after having TURBT and are able to resume normal physical activity within two weeks. \n You should be offered follow-up appointments at three months and nine months to check your bladder, using a  cystoscopy . If your cancer returns after six months, and is small,\u00a0you may be offered a treatment called fulguration. This involves using an electric current to destroy the cancer cells. \n Intermediate-risk \n People with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a course of at least six doses of chemotherapy. The liquid is placed directly into your bladder,\u00a0using a catheter, and kept there for around an hour before being drained away. \n You should be offered follow-up appointments at three months, nine months, 18 months, then once every year.\u00a0At\u00a0these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.\u00a0If your cancer returns within five years, you'll be referred back to a specialist urology team. \n Some residue of the chemotherapy medication may be left in your urine after treatment, which could severely irritate your skin. It helps\u00a0if you urinate while sitting down and that you're careful not to splash yourself or the toilet seat. After passing urine, wash the skin around your genitals with soap and water. \n If you're sexually active, it's important to use a barrier method of  contraception , such as a condom. This is\u00a0because the medication may be present in your semen or vaginal fluids, which can cause irritation. \n You also shouldn't try to get pregnant or father a child while having chemotherapy for bladder cancer, as the medication can increase the risk of having a child with birth defects. \n High-risk \n People with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer should be offered a second TURBT operation, within six weeks of the initial investigation\u00a0(see  diagnosing bladder cancer ). A  CT scan \u00a0or an\u00a0 MRI scan  may also be required. \n Your urologist and clinical nurse specialist\u00a0will discuss\u00a0your treatment options with you, which will either be: \n \n a course of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) treatment \u2013 using a variant of the\u00a0 BCG vaccine  \n an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) \n \n The BCG vaccine is passed into your bladder through a catheter and left for two hours before being drained away. Most people require weekly treatments over a six-week period. Common side effects of\u00a0BCG include: \n \n a frequent need to urinate \n pain when urinating \n blood in your urine (haematuria) \n flu-like symptoms, such as tiredness, fever and aching \n urinary tract infections \n \n If\u00a0BCG\u00a0treatment doesn't work, or the side effects are too strong, you'll be referred back to a specialist urology team. \n You should be offered follow-up appointments every three months for the first two years, then every six months for the next two years, then once a year.\u00a0At\u00a0these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy. \n If you decide to have a cystectomy, your surgeon will\u00a0need to\u00a0create an alternative way for urine to leave your body (urinary diversion). Your clinical nurse specialist can discuss your options for the procedure and how the urinary diversion will be created. \n Read about the\u00a0 complications of bladder cancer surgery \u00a0for more information about urinary diversion and sexual problems after surgery. \n After having a cystectomy,\u00a0you should be offered follow-up appointments including a CT scan at six and 12 months, and\u00a0blood tests once a year. Men require an appointment to check their urethra once a year for five years. \n Muscle-invasive bladder cancer \n The recommended treatment plan for muscle-invasive bladder cancer depends on how far the cancer has spread. With T2 and\u00a0T3 bladder cancer, treatment aims to cure the condition if possible, or at least control it for a long time. \n Your urologist, oncologist and clinical nurse specialist\u00a0will discuss\u00a0your treatment options with you, which will either be: \n \n an operation to remove your bladder (cystectomy) \u2013 see above \n  radiotherapy  with a radiosensitiser \n \n Your oncologist\u00a0should also discuss the possibility of having chemotherapy before either\u00a0of these treatments (neoadjuvant therapy), if it's suitable for you. \n Radiotherapy with a radiosensitiser \n Radiotherapy is given by a machine that beams the radiation at the bladder (external radiotherapy). Sessions are usually given on a daily basis for five days a week over the course of four to seven weeks. Each session lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes. \n A radiosensitiser\u00a0should also be given alongside radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is a medicine which affects the cells of a tumour, to enhance the effect of radiotherapy. It has a much smaller effect on normal tissue. \n As well as destroying cancerous cells, radiotherapy can also damage healthy cells, which means it can cause a number of side effects. These include: \n \n  diarrhoea   \n  inflammation of the bladder (cystitis)  \n tightening of the vagina (in women), which can make having sex painful \n erectile dysfunction (in men) \n loss of pubic hair \n infertility \n tiredness \n difficulty passing urine \n \n Most of these side effects should pass a few weeks after your treatment finishes, although there's a chance they'll be permanent. \n Having radiation directed at your pelvis usually means you'll be infertile for the rest of your life.\u00a0However, most people treated for bladder cancer are too old to have children, so this isn't usually a problem. \n After having radiotherapy for bladder cancer,\u00a0you should be offered follow-up appointments\u00a0every three months for the first two years, then every six months for the next\u00a0two years, and every year after that.\u00a0At\u00a0these appointments, your bladder will be checked using a cystoscopy.\u00a0 \n You may also be offered CT scans of your abdomen, pelvis and chest after six months, one year and two years. A CT scan of your urinary tract may be offered every year for five years. \n Surgery or radiotherapy? \n Your MDT may recommend a specific treatment\u00a0because of\u00a0your individual circumstances. \n For example, someone with a small bladder or\u00a0many existing urinary symptoms is better suited to surgery. Someone who has a single bladder tumour with normal bladder function is better suited for treatments that preserve the bladder. \n However, your input is also important, so you should discuss which treatment is best for you with your MDT. \n There are pros and cons of both surgery and radiotherapy. \n The pros of having a radical cystectomy include: \n \n treatment is carried out in one go \n you won't need regular cystoscopies after treatment, although other less invasive tests\u00a0may be needed \n \n The cons of having a radical cystectomy include: \n \n it can take up to three months to fully recover \n a risk of general surgical complications, such as pain, infection and bleeding \n a risk of complications from the use of\u00a0general anaesthetic \n an alternative way of passing urine out of your body needs to be created, which may involve an external bag \n a high risk of erectile dysfunction in men (estimated at around 90%)\u00a0as a result of nerve damage \n after surgery, some women may find sex uncomfortable, as their vagina may be smaller \n a small chance of a fatal complication, such as a  heart attack ,\u00a0 stroke  or\u00a0 deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  \n \n The pros of having radiotherapy include: \n \n there's no need to have surgery, which is often an important consideration for people in poor health \n your bladder function may not be affected, as your bladder isn't removed \n there's less chance of causing erectile dysfunction (around 30%) \n \n The cons of having radiotherapy include: \n \n you'll require regular sessions of radiotherapy for four to seven weeks \n short-term side effects are common,\u00a0such as diarrhoea, tiredness and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) \n a small chance\u00a0of permanently damaging the bladder, which could lead to problems urinating \n women may experience a narrowed vagina, making sex difficult and uncomfortable \n \n Chemotherapy \n In some cases,\u00a0chemotherapy may be used during treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Instead of medication being put directly into your bladder, it's put into a vein in your arm. This is called intravenous chemotherapy and can be used: \n \n before radiotherapy and surgery to shrink the size of any tumours \n in combination with radiotherapy before surgery (chemoradiation) \n to slow the spread of incurable advanced bladder cancer (palliative chemotherapy) \n \n There isn't enough evidence to say whether chemotherapy is an effective treatment when it's given after surgery to prevent the cancer returning. It's usually only used this way as part of a  clinical trial .\u00a0See  clinical trials for bladder cancer \u00a0for more information. \n Chemotherapy is usually given over a few consecutive days at first. You'll then have a few weeks off to allow your body to recover before the treatment begins again. This cycle will be repeated for a few months. \n As the chemotherapy medication is being injected into your blood, you'll experience a wider range of side effects than if you were having chemotherapy directly into the bladder. These side effects should stop after the treatment has finished. \n Chemotherapy weakens your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. It's important to report any symptoms of a potential infection, such as a high temperature, persistent cough or reddening of the skin, to your MDT. Avoid close contact with people who are known to have an infection. \n Other\u00a0side effects of chemotherapy can include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n  hair loss  \n lack of appetite \n tiredness \n \n Locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer \n The recommended treatment plan for\u00a0locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer\u00a0depends on how far the cancer has spread. Your oncologist should discuss your treatment options with you, which may include: \n \n a course of chemotherapy \n treatments to relieve cancer symptoms \n \n Chemotherapy \n If you receive a course of chemotherapy, you'll be given a combination of drugs to help relieve the side effects of treatment. Treatment may be stopped if chemotherapy isn't helping, or a second course may be offered. \n Relieving cancer symptoms \n You may be offered treatment to relieve any cancer symptoms. This may include: \n \n radiotherapy to treat painful urination, blood in urine, frequently needing to urinate or pain in your pelvic area \n treatment to drain your kidneys, if they become blocked and cause lower back pain \n \n Palliative care \n If you cancer is at an advanced stage and can't be cured, your MDT should discuss how the cancer will progress and which treatments are available to ease the symptoms.\u00a0 \n You can be referred to a palliative care team, who can provide support and practical help, including pain relief. \n Read more about  end of life care", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have symptoms of bladder cancer, such as blood in your urine, you should see your GP. \n Your GP may ask about your\u00a0symptoms,\u00a0family history and whether you've been exposed to any possible causes of bladder cancer,\u00a0such as\u00a0smoking. \n In some cases, your GP may request a urine sample, so\u00a0it can be tested in a laboratory for traces of blood, bacteria or abnormal cells. \n Your GP\u00a0may also carry out a physical examination of your rectum and vagina,\u00a0as bladder cancer\u00a0sometimes causes a noticeable lump that presses against them. \n If your doctor suspects\u00a0bladder cancer,\u00a0you'll be\u00a0referred to a hospital for further tests. \n In 2015, the  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  published guidelines to help GPs recognise the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer and refer people for the right tests faster.\u00a0Find out  who should be referred for further tests for suspected bladder cancer . \n At the\u00a0hospital \n Some hospitals have\u00a0specialist clinics for people with\u00a0blood in their urine (haematuria), while others have specialist urology departments for people with urinary tract problems. \n Cystoscopy \n If you're referred to a hospital specialist and they think you might have bladder cancer, you should first be offered a  cystoscopy . \n This procedure allows the specialist to examine the inside of your bladder by passing a cystoscope through your urethra (the tube through which you urinate).\u00a0A cystoscope is\u00a0a\u00a0thin tube with a camera and light at the end. \n Before having a cystoscopy,\u00a0a\u00a0 local anaesthetic \u00a0gel is applied to your urethra (the tube through which you urinate) so\u00a0you don't feel any pain.\u00a0The gel also\u00a0helps the cystoscope to pass into the urethra more easily. \n The procedure usually takes about\u00a0five minutes. \n Imaging scans \n You may be offered a\u00a0 CT scan \u00a0or an\u00a0 MRI scan  if the specialist feels they need a more detailed picture of your bladder. \n An intravenous (IV) urogram may also be used to look at your whole urinary system before or after treatment for bladder cancer. \n During this procedure, dye is injected into your bloodstream and X-rays are used to study it as it passes through your urinary system. \n Transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT) \n If abnormalities are found in your bladder during a cystoscopy, you should be offered an operation known as TURBT. This is\u00a0so any abnormal areas of tissue\u00a0can be removed and tested for cancer (a biopsy). \n TURBT\u00a0is carried out under\u00a0 general anaesthetic . \n Sometimes, a sample of the muscle wall of your bladder is also taken to check whether the cancer has spread, but this may be a separate operation within six weeks of the first\u00a0 biopsy . \n You should also be offered a dose of\u00a0 chemotherapy  after the operation. This may help to prevent the bladder cancer returning, if the removed cells are found to be cancerous. \n See\u00a0 treating bladder cancer  for more information about the TURBT procedure \n Staging and grading \n Once these tests have been completed, it should be possible to tell you the grade of the cancer and what stage it is. \n Staging is a measurement of how far the cancer has spread. Lower-stage cancers are smaller and have a better chance of successful treatment. \n Grading is a measurement of how likely a cancer is to spread.\u00a0The grade of a cancer is usually described using a number system ranging from G1 to G3. High-grade cancers are more likely to spread than low-grade cancers.\u00a0 \n The most widely used staging system for bladder cancer is known as the TNM system, where: \n \n T stands for how\u00a0far into the bladder the tumour has grown \n N stands for whether the cancer has spread into nearby lymph nodes \n M stands for whether the cancer has spread into another part of the body (metastasis), such as the lungs \n \n T stages \n The T staging system is as follows: \n \n TIS or CIS (carcinoma in situ) \u2013 a very early high-grade cancer confined to the innermost layer of the bladder lining \n Ta \u2013 the cancer is just in the innermost layer of the bladder lining \n T1 \u2013 the cancerous cells have started to grow into the connective tissue beyond the bladder lining \n \n Bladder cancer up to the T1 stage is usually called early bladder cancer or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. \n If the tumour grows larger than this, it's usually called muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is categorised as: \n \n T2 \u2013 the cancer has grown through the connective tissue, into the bladder muscle \n T3 \u2013 the cancer has grown through the layer of muscles, into the surrounding layer of fat \n \n If the tumour grows larger than the T3 stage, it's considered to be advanced bladder cancer and is categorised as: \n \n T4 \u2013 the cancer has spread outside the bladder, into surrounding organs \n \n N stages \n The N staging system is as follows: \n \n N0 \u2013 there are no cancerous cells in any of your lymph nodes \n N1 \u2013 there are cancerous cells in just one of your lymph nodes in your pelvis \n N2 \u2013 there are cancerous cells in two or more lymph nodes in your pelvis \n N3 \u2013 there are cancerous cells in one or more of your lymph nodes (known as common iliac nodes) deep in your groin \n \n M stages \n There are only two options in the M system: \n \n M0 \u2013 where the cancer hasn't spread to another part of the body \n M1 \u2013 where the cancer has spread to another part of the body, such as the bones, lungs or liver \n \n The TNM system can be difficult to understand, so don't be afraid to ask your care team questions about your test results and what they mean for your treatment and outlook."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma)", "introduction": "Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare but aggressive type of cancer. \n The bile duct system, or \"biliary\" system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. Bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods. \n Symptoms of bile duct cancer \n In most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can\u00a0include: \n \n jaundice\u00a0\u2013 yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine\u00a0 \n unintentional weight loss \n abdominal pain \n \n See your GP if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms. While it is unlikely you have bile duct cancer, it is best to get it checked. \n Read more about the  symptoms of bile duct cancer  \n Why does bile duct cancer happen? \n The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. However, some things\u00a0may increase your chances of developing the condition. The most common\u00a0include being over 65 years old or having\u00a0a\u00a0rare chronic liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). \n Read more about the  causes of bile duct cancer  \n Types of bile duct cancer \n There are two main types of bile duct cancer,\u00a0depending on where the cancer begins: \n \n cancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer \n cancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancer \n \n Diagnosis \n Cancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests, including:\u00a0 \n \n  blood tests  \n  ultrasound scans  \n  computerised tomography (CT) scans  \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  \n \n For some of these tests, you\u00a0may need to be injected with a special dye that highlights your bile ducts. \n You may also\u00a0need a\u00a0 biopsy . This involves removing a small sample of tissue so\u00a0it can be studied under a microscope. However, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone. \n Read more about  diagnosing bile duct cancer  \n How is bile duct cancer treated? \n Cancer of the bile duct\u00a0can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven't spread. If this is the case, some or all of the bile duct\u00a0may be removed. \n Only a small proportion of bile duct cancer cases are diagnosed early enough to be suitable for surgery. This is\u00a0because symptoms usually develop at a late stage. \n Despite this, treatment\u00a0such as\u00a0 chemotherapy  can relieve\u00a0the symptoms of bile duct cancer and improve the quality of life of people in the advanced stages of the condition. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating bile duct cancer  \n Who is affected? \n Less than\u00a02,000\u00a0people are diagnosed with bile duct cancer each year in Great Britain. \n However, studies suggest that cases of bile duct cancer are increasing in most countries. The reasons for this are unknown. \n Most cases of bile duct cancer occur in people\u00a0over the age of 65. The condition affects men and women almost equally. \n Can bile duct cancer be prevented? \n There are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it. \n The\u00a0most effective\u00a0ways of\u00a0achieving this are reducing your alcohol intake, as\u00a0 cirrhosis  is a risk factor,\u00a0and trying to ensure that you don't become infected with\u00a0hepatitis B or hepatitis C. \n Read more about  preventing bile duct cancer", "symptoms": "Bile duct cancer doesn't usually cause any symptoms until the flow of bile from the liver is blocked. \n In most cases, the condition is at an advanced stage by this time. \n The blockage will cause bile to move back into the blood and body tissue, resulting in symptoms such as: \n \n jaundice\u00a0\u2013\u00a0yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine \n unintentional weight loss\u00a0 \n abdominal pain \u2013 most people feel a dull ache in the upper right hand side of their abdomen (stomach) \n high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above and shivering \n loss of appetite \n \n When to seek medical advice \n Always visit your GP if you have jaundice. While jaundice is unlikely to be caused by bile duct cancer, it could indicate an underlying problem with the liver, such as  hepatitis .", "causes": "The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown, although some things can increase the risk of developing the condition. \n Cancer\u00a0begins with a change (mutation) in the structure of the DNA in cells, which can affect how they grow. This means that cells grow and reproduce uncontrollably, producing a lump of tissue called a tumour. \n If left untreated, cancer can grow and spread to other parts of your body, either directly or through the blood and lymphatic system. \n Increased risk \n A\u00a0number of\u00a0factors that increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer have been identified. Some of these are discussed below. \n Age \n Your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct increase as you get older. Most people with the condition are over 65 years old. \n Primary sclerosing cholangitis \n Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare type of liver disease that causes\u00a0long-lasting (chronic) inflammation of the liver. \n It\u00a0usually occurs in people\u00a0aged 30-50. Up to 10% of people with  ulcerative colitis  (inflammation of the colon and rectum) also have PSC. \n Around 10-20% of people with PSC will develop bile duct cancer.\u00a0Your risk of developing bile duct cancer is thought to be higher if you have PSC and you smoke. \n Bile duct abnormalities \n Some people can have fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in their bile duct.\u00a0These cysts are usually congenital, which means\u00a0they are present from\u00a0birth. \n The most common types are choledochal cysts and Caroli's disease, but both conditions are very rare. \n Up to 20%\u00a0of people with choledochal cysts that are not removed will develop cancer of the bile duct. \n Biliary stones \n Biliary stones are similar to  gallstones , except they form inside the liver rather than inside the gallbladder. \n Biliary stones are rare in western Europe, but are relatively common in parts of Asia, such as Japan and Taiwan. It is estimated that approximately 10% of people with biliary stones will develop bile duct cancer. \n Parasitic infection \n Liver flukes are a type of parasitic insect known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. You can become infected with liver flukes by eating undercooked fish that has been contaminated with fluke eggs. \n Liver fluke infections are usually only a problem in Asia (especially Thailand) and Africa, where liver flukes are more widespread. \n Exposure to toxins \n Exposure to certain chemical toxins is known to increase the risk of developing bile duct cancer. \n For example, if you are exposed to a chemical called thorotrast, your chances of developing bile duct cancer rises. Thorotrast was widely used in radiography until it was banned during the 1960s after its dangerous properties were fully understood. \n Other toxins that may increase your chances of developing cancer of the bile duct include: \n \n asbestos \u2013\u00a0a fire-resistant material\u00a0that was widely used in construction and manufacturing, but is now banned in this country \n polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) \u2013\u00a0a chemical that was used in manufacturing and building but, like asbestos, has now been banned \n \n Other factors \n The following factors\u00a0are linked with an increased risk of developing bile duct cancer, but more research is still needed: \n \n  hepatitis B \u00a0and  hepatitis C  \n  cirrhosis  (a scarred liver) as a result of drinking excess amounts of alcohol \n  HIV  \n  diabetes  \n  obesity  \n  smoking", "treatment": "Most cases of bile duct cancer cannot be cured. Instead, treatment is most commonly used to relieve symptoms. \n Cancer treatment team \n Due to the rarity of bile duct cancer, you are likely to be referred to a specialist hepatobiliary unit\u00a0with experience in treating the condition. \n A multidisciplinary team (MDT) made up of different specialists\u00a0will help you decide on your treatment, but the final decision will be yours. Your MDT\u00a0may\u00a0include: \n \n a liver surgeon \u2013 a specialist in treating cancers of the liver \n a medical or clinical oncologist \u2013 a specialist in the non-surgical treatment of cancer using techniques such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy \n a pathologist \u2013 a specialist in diseased tissue \n a radiologist \u2013 a specialist in\u00a0radiological diagnosis and intervention\u00a0 \n a cancer nurse\u00a0\u2013 who usually acts as the first point of contact between you and the rest of the care team\u00a0 \n a gastroenterologist \u2013 a specialist in the medical management of liver and biliary disease \n \n Before going to hospital to discuss your treatment options, you may want to write a list of questions to ask the specialist. For example, you may want to find out the\u00a0advantages and disadvantages of particular treatments. \n Your treatment plan \n Your recommended treatment plan will be determined by your general health and the\u00a0 stage the cancer has reached . \n In cases of stage 1 and stage\u00a02 bile duct cancer, a cure may be possible by surgically removing the affected part of the bile duct, and possibly some of the liver or gallbladder. \n In cases of stage 3 bile duct cancers, the chances of achieving a successful cure will depend on how many lymph nodes have been affected. A cure may be possible if only a few nodes have cancerous cells in them, or it may be possible to slow the spread of the cancer by surgically removing the lymph nodes. \n In cases of stage\u00a04 bile duct cancer, achieving a successful cure is highly unlikely. However, stenting, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can often be used to help relieve the symptoms. \n Your treatment plan may also be different if you have intrahepatic bile duct cancer, as this is usually treated in a similar way to liver cancer. Read more about  treating liver cancer . \n A number of experimental treatments may be available as part of a clinical trial (see below). \n Surgery \n If your MDT thinks it is possible to cure your bile duct cancer, surgery will be needed to remove any cancerous tissue. Depending on the extent of the cancer, it may be necessary to remove: \n \n the part of your bile duct that contains cancerous cells \n your gallbladder \n nearby lymph nodes \n a large part\u00a0of your liver \n \n After surgery, it is usually possible to reconstruct what remains of the bile duct so that bile can still\u00a0flow into the intestine. \n Similarly, it is often possible for the liver to resume normal function after surgery because we do not need all of our liver. The liver can also regenerate itself after surgery. \n You may need to stay in hospital for up to two weeks or more after having bile duct cancer surgery before you are well enough to go home. \n Success rates of bile duct surgery depend on individual circumstances, such as whether nearby lymph nodes are free of cancer and whether it was possible to remove all of the cancerous cells during surgery. \n As a general estimate, 20-40% of people who have surgery for bile duct cancer survive for five years or more after their operation. \n Unblocking the bile duct \n If your bile duct becomes blocked as a result of cancer, treatment to unblock it may be recommended. This will help resolve symptoms such as: \n \n jaundice \u2013\u00a0yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes \n itchy skin \n abdominal (tummy) pain \n \n Unblocking the bile duct is sometimes necessary if the flow of bile back into your liver starts to affect the normal functioning of your liver. \n The bile duct can be unblocked by using a small tube called a stent.\u00a0The stent widens the bile duct, which should help to get the bile flowing again. \n A stent can be inserted using either: \n \n a\u00a0variation of the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, which uses an endoscope to guide the stent into the bile duct \n a\u00a0variation of the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) procedure, which involves making a small incision (under local anaesthetic) in your abdominal wall \n \n Occasionally, an implanted stent can become blocked. If this occurs, it will need to be removed and replaced. \n Radiotherapy \n Radiotherapy is not a standard treatment for bile duct cancer, but\u00a0may help to relieve the symptoms, slow the spread of the cancer and prolong life. Two types of radiotherapy are used to treat bile duct cancer: \n \n external beam radiotherapy \u2013 a machine is used to target radioactive beams at your bile duct \n internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) \u2013 a radioactive wire is placed inside your bile duct next to the tumour \n \n Radiotherapy works by damaging the cancerous cells. However, it can also damage healthy cells and cause side effects. Side effects of radiotherapy include: \n \n nausea (feeling sick) \n vomiting \n fatigue (severe tiredness) \n \n Read more about\u00a0 radiotherapy  \n Chemotherapy \n Chemotherapy is used in a similar way to radiotherapy to relieve the symptoms of cancer, slow down the rate it spreads and prolong life. It is sometimes used in combination with radiotherapy. \n Research carried out in 2010 found that combining two chemotherapy medications, called cisplatin and gemcitabine, is an effective way of helping to slow the spread of cancer and improve survival rates. \n Medicines used in chemotherapy can sometimes damage healthy tissue as well as cancerous tissue, and adverse side effects are common. Side effects of chemotherapy can include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n fatigue \n hair loss \n \n However, these side effects should stop once the course of treatment has finished. Chemotherapy can also weaken your immune system, making you more vulnerable to infection. \n Read more about  chemotherapy  \n Clinical trials and experimental treatments \n The treatments for bile duct cancer are not as effective as treatments for other types of cancer. Therefore, a number of clinical trials are being conducted to find better ways of treating the condition. \n For example, ongoing trials are looking at new combinations of chemotherapy medicines, which may help\u00a0extend the lifespan of someone with bile duct cancer. \n Targeted therapies \n Another promising field of research involves using targeted therapies to treat bile duct cancer. Targeted therapies are medications\u00a0that target the processes that cancerous cells need to grow and reproduce. \n In studies for some cancers, a medication called sorafenib has proved reasonably effective. Sorafenib works by blocking a protein that cancerous cells need to create a blood supply. However, sorafenib is not currently used as routine treatment for bile duct cancer. \n As bile duct cancer is a rare condition, there is a possibility you may be invited to take part in a clinical trial looking\u00a0at the use of these types of experimental treatments. \n All clinical trials are carried out under strict ethical guidelines based on the principles of patient care. However, there is no guarantee that the treatment you receive during a clinical trial will be more effective, or even as effective, as existing treatments. \n Read more about  clinical trials \u00a0and  clinical trials for bile duct cancer", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Bile duct cancer can be a challenging condition to diagnose. You usually need several different tests before an accurate diagnosis can be made. \n Blood tests \n In bile duct cancer, the cancerous cells may release certain\u00a0chemicals that can be detected using  blood tests . These are known as tumour markers. \n However, tumour markers can also be caused by other conditions.\u00a0A positive blood test does not necessarily mean you have bile duct cancer, and a negative blood test does not always mean\u00a0you don't. \n Scans \n A number of scans can be used to examine your bile ducts in more detail and check for lumps or other abnormalities that could be the result of cancer. These scans include: \n \n  ultrasound scan \u00a0\u2013\u00a0high-frequency sound waves are used to build up a picture of the inside of your body \n  computer tomography (CT) scan  \u2013\u00a0a series of X-rays of your liver are taken and a computer is used to assemble them into a more detailed three-dimensional image \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013 this uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a picture of the inside of your liver \n \n Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) \n Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) allows your bile ducts show up more clearly on an  X-ray  scanner.\u00a0\u00a0 \n A special dye is injected and the X-ray scanner is used to guide an endoscope (a small, flexible tube with a camera at the end) down your throat and into your bile duct. The endoscope can detect blockages in your bile duct\u00a0that could be the result of bile duct cancer. \n A short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, may also be inserted into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely. \n Spyglass \n An advanced form of ERCP is a special test called a spyglass. This involves passing a specialised endoscope into the bile duct to detect abnormalities. It also enables a biopsy\u00a0to be taken. \n While this test can help confirm bile duct cancer in uncertain cases, it is very expensive and requires specialist training. Therefore, it is only available at a limited number of centres. \n Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) \n Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is carried out to obtain a detailed X-ray image of your bile duct. \n The side of your abdomen (tummy)\u00a0is numbed using\u00a0 local anaesthetic , and\u00a0a special dye\u00a0that shows up on X-rays is injected through your skin and into your liver duct. \n As with ECRP, a stent may be inserted during the procedure. PTC and ECRP\u00a0are both\u00a0useful ways of detecting any blockages in your bile duct that could be caused by bile duct cancer. \n Biopsy \n If scans indicate\u00a0that you may have bile duct cancer, a\u00a0 biopsy \u00a0may be\u00a0carried out to confirm a diagnosis. \n During\u00a0a biopsy, a small sample of tissue is taken from the body and checked under a microscope for\u00a0cancerous cells. \n A biopsy is usually performed while ERCP or PTC is being carried out. As well as taking bile and tissue samples from your bile duct, samples may be taken from nearby lymph nodes. This is to check whether the cancer has spread from your bile duct into your lymphatic system. \n Staging \n A widely used method of staging bile duct cancer is a number staging system. The stages are: \n \n stage 1A \u2013\u00a0the cancer is contained inside the bile duct \n stage 1B \u2013 the cancer is beginning to spread beyond the walls of the bile duct, but has not spread into the surrounding tissue or lymph nodes \n stage 2 \u2013 the cancer has spread into nearby tissue, such as the liver, but has not spread into the lymph nodes \n stage 3 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread into the lymph nodes\u00a0and\u00a0major blood vessels that supply the liver \n stage 4 \u2013\u00a0the cancer has spread into distant organs, such as the lungs \n \n Read more about  staging bile duct cancer on the Cancer Research UK website  \n Cancer support \n If you are diagnosed with cancer, the  Alan Morement Memorial Fund (AMMF)  is currently the only dedicated UK charity that provides support for people affected by bile duct cancer."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Benign prostate enlargement", "introduction": "Benign prostate enlargement (BPE), also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is a condition that affects older men. \n It's particularly common in men over 50 years of age and isn't usually a serious threat to health. \n Prostate gland \n The prostate is a small gland found only in men, located in the pelvis, between the penis and bladder. It's involved in the production of semen. \n The prostate produces a thick, white fluid that's made into a thinner\u00a0liquid by a protein called prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The liquid is then mixed with sperm, produced by the testicles, to create semen. \n If the prostate becomes enlarged, it can place pressure on the bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes). This can\u00a0affect how you pass urine and may cause: \n \n difficulty starting urination \n a frequent need to urinate \n difficulty fully emptying the bladder \n \n In some men, the symptoms are mild and don't require treatment. In others, the symptoms can be very troublesome and have a major impact on a person's quality of life. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of benign prostate enlargement  \n Many men worry that having an enlarged prostate means they have an increased risk of developing  prostate cancer   .\u00a0This isn't the case. The risk of prostate cancer is no greater for men with an enlarged prostate than it is for men without an\u00a0enlarged prostate. \n What causes benign prostate enlargement? \n The cause of prostate enlargement is unknown, but most experts agree that it's linked to hormonal changes that occur as a man gets older. \n Read more about the  causes of benign prostate enlargement  \n How is benign prostate enlargement diagnosed? \n If your GP suspects that you have an enlarged prostate, you'll be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess your symptoms. \n Each question has five possible answers that carry a score, and your overall score indicates the severity of your symptoms. \n Your GP will also want to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to prostate enlargement.\u00a0 \n You may have a number of standard tests, such as urine tests, plus some more specific tests, such as a\u00a0blood test that measures PSA. \n Read more about  diagnosing benign prostate enlargement  \n Treating benign prostate enlargement \n Treatment for an enlarged prostate is determined by the severity of your symptoms. \n If you have mild to moderate\u00a0symptoms, you won't receive any immediate medical treatment, but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate. \n You'll probably also be advised to make\u00a0lifestyle changes, such as limiting your caffeine and\u00a0 alcohol  intake, and  exercising regularly ,\u00a0to see if they improve your symptoms. \n As well as\u00a0lifestyle changes, medication is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement.\u00a0Finasteride and dutasteride are medications\u00a0that are commonly used. They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve associated symptoms. \n Alpha blockers may also be prescribed. They help to relax your bladder muscles, making it easier to pass urine. Tamsulosin and alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. \n Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement that have failed to respond to medication. \n Read more about  treating benign prostate enlargement  \n Complications of benign prostate enlargement \n Benign prostate enlargement can sometimes lead to complications such as a\u00a0 urinary tract infection (UTI)  or acute urinary retention. Serious complications are rare. \n Read more about the  complications of benign prostate enlargement  \n How common is benign prostate enlargement? \n Benign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men over 50 years of age. \n Around 4 out of 10 men (40%) over 50, and 3 out of 4 men (75%) in their 70s have urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis). \n This can affect urination in a number of ways. For example, it can: \n \n make it difficult for you to start urinating \n weaken the\u00a0flow of urine or cause \"stopping and starting\" \n cause you to strain to pass urine \n cause you to need to urinate\u00a0frequently \n cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate \n cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in\u00a0 urinary incontinence  if you can't find a toilet quickly enough \n cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully \n cause blood in the urine (haematuria) \n \n In the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as\u00a0bladder stones,\u00a0bladder infections and kidney damage. \n When to seek medical advice \n See\u00a0your GP if you notice any problems with, or changes to,\u00a0your usual pattern of urination. Even if the symptoms are mild, they could be caused by a condition that needs to be investigated. \n Any\u00a0blood in the urine must be investigated by your GP to rule out other more serious conditions.", "causes": "The exact cause of benign prostate enlargement is unknown, but research suggests that hormones probably play an important role in the condition's development. \n Hormones are powerful chemicals that can have a wide range of effects on the cells of the body. \n One theory is that as some men get older, the levels of a type of hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) increases, which may stimulate the growth of the prostate. \n Another theory suggests that two hormones, testosterone and oestrogen, play a role. Younger men produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as men get older, their levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It's been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth. \n Risk factors \n Research has shown that rates of benign prostate enlargement are higher among men with  high blood pressure  and  diabetes . However, both diabetes and high blood pressure are associated with the natural ageing process, so there may not be a direct connection between the three conditions.", "treatment": "The treatment for an enlarged prostate gland will depend on how severe your symptoms are. \n The three main treatments are: \n \n lifestyle changes \n medication \n surgery \n \n If your symptoms are mild to moderate, you may not receive any immediate medical treatment, but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate gland. This is often referred to as \"watchful waiting\". \n You may also be advised to make lifestyle\u00a0changes to see whether they improve your symptoms. \n The various treatments for prostate enlargement\u00a0are outlined below. You can also read a summary of the pros and cons\u00a0of the treatments for prostate enlargement, allowing you to compare your treatment options. \n Lifestyle changes \n If your prostate gland is enlarged, you may be advised to: \n \n avoid drinking any liquids for one to two hours before going to bed \u2013 this will reduce your chances of waking up during the night to pass urine (nocturia) \n experiment with the time you take prescribed medication \u2013 for example, taking it\u00a0at 7pm may help prevent nocturia \n stop drinking\u00a0 alcohol  and caffeine, or limit your consumption of them \u2013 these drinks\u00a0can irritate your bladder and make your symptoms worse \n  exercise regularly \u00a0\u2013 research shows moderate exercise, such as  walking  for 30 to 60 minutes a day, can improve symptoms, although it's unclear exactly why this is the case\u00a0 \n join a patient support group \u2013 your doctor should be able to recommend one, which\u00a0may help you manage mild symptoms without the need for medication \n \n Bladder training \n Bladder training is an exercise programme that aims to increase the time between urination and the amount of urine your bladder can hold. \n You'll be given a target, such as waiting at least two hours between each time you urinate. \n It's a good idea to use a bladder training chart, which allows you to record each time you pass urine and the volume of urine passed\u00a0\u2013 you'll need a plastic jug to measure this. Your doctor should give you a chart to take home. \n You'll also be taught a number of exercises, such as breathing, relaxation and muscle exercises, to help take your mind off the need to urinate. \n Over time your target time will be increased, and at the end of the programme you should find that you're able to go for longer without urinating. \n Bladder training should only be carried out under medical supervision. \n Medication \n Medication, in combination with the lifestyle changes above, is usually recommended to treat moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement. \n Finasteride or dutasteride \n Finasteride\u00a0and\u00a0dutasteride are widely used to treat benign prostate enlargement. \n They block the effects of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the prostate gland, which can reduce the size of the prostate and improve your associated symptoms. \n Find out about the\u00a0 causes of prostate enlargement  \n If you're prescribed one of these medications, you may experience an immediate improvement in symptoms. \n However, you'll need to take it for at least six months to get the maximum benefit, and your doctor will need to monitor you every year. \n Use\u00a0 condoms \u00a0if you're sexually active\u00a0\u2013\u00a0both finasteride and dutasteride can have an adverse effect on your sperm. If you get a woman pregnant, there's a risk the baby could develop birth defects. \n Other possible side effects can also\u00a0include\u00a0 impotence  and little or no\u00a0sperm when you ejaculate. \n In many cases, these side effects will improve as your body gets used to the medication. See your GP if the side effects are troubling you. \n Alpha blockers \n Alpha blockers help relax the muscles of your bladder, making it easier to pass urine. You may be prescribed alpha blockers as your primary treatment or in combination with finasteride. \n Tamsulosin\u00a0and\u00a0alfuzosin are two alpha blockers commonly used to treat benign prostate enlargement. Side effects of tamsulosin and alfuzosin are uncommon and usually mild. \n They include: \n \n dizziness\u00a0 \n  headaches \u00a0 \n weakness \n little or no sperm when you ejaculate \n \n You should only begin taking alpha blockers over a restful weekend when you're not planning to drive, as there's a risk they could cause  low blood pressure (hypotension)  and fainting. \n Generally, if you experience dizziness while taking this medication, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until it's passed. \n Surgery \n Surgery is usually only recommended for moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostate enlargement\u00a0that have failed to respond to medication. \n Various procedures can be used to reduce the pressure on your bladder. \n Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) \n Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)\u00a0involves inserting a small instrument called a resectoscope into your urethra, the\u00a0tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis. \n A wire loop heated by an electric current\u00a0is used to remove excess tissue from your prostate. \n TURP is carried out using either a  general anaesthetic , where you're asleep, or a spinal anaesthetic, where you're awake, but the lower half of your body is numbed. \n The procedure can take up to an hour, depending on how much tissue needs to be removed. Most men are well enough to leave hospital two to three days after the operation. \n After\u00a0surgery, you'll be unable to urinate normally at first\u00a0because of your swollen urethra.\u00a0 \n A thin tube called a\u00a0catheter will be inserted into your urethra and up into your bladder to allow urine to drain away. This will usually be removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery. \n A common complication of TURP is you'll no longer produce semen when you ejaculate. This is known as retrograde ejaculation. \n It causes sperm to go into your bladder rather than out of your penis during ejaculation. However, you'll still experience the physical pleasure associated with ejaculation (the climax). \n Bladder neck incision\u00a0(TUIP) \n Bladder neck incision\u00a0involves widening the urethra so it is easier to pass urine. It is also known as\u00a0transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP). \n Like TURP, the surgeon will insert a resectoscope into your urethra. The resectoscope has a heated wire loop at the end and is used to make small cuts (incisions) in the muscle where the prostate meets the bladder. \n This type of surgery relaxes the opening to the bladder, helping urine flow out of it. As with TURP, TUIP\u00a0is carried out under a spinal or general anaesthetic. \n After surgery, you may not be able to urinate and a catheter may be needed to empty your bladder. Like TURP, you'll only need to use a catheter for a short time until you're able to urinate normally. \n There's less of a risk of retrograde ejaculation with TUIP compared with TURP, although it can sometimes still occur. \n Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate\u00a0(HoLEP) \n Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is similar to a TURP. Excess prostate tissue is removed using an instrument inserted through the urethra. However, it uses\u00a0a laser, rather than a wire loop. \n There are some advantages to using this technique rather than a TURP, but also some disadvantages. \n If you have been offered a HoLEP, you may want to ask your surgeon to explain why this was chosen for you, and the risks and benefits compared\u00a0with TURP. \n Insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants \n The insertion of prostatic urethral lift implants is a new surgical procedure that can help relieve urinary symptoms. \n The procedure can be carried out under\u00a0local anaesthesia or general anaesthesia. \n It involves inserting tiny implants through the urethra.\u00a0The implants are then positioned to hold the enlarged prostate away from the urethra so it isn't blocked. \n One of the big advantages\u00a0of prostatic urethral lift implants compared with TURP\u00a0and TUIP is a reduced risk to your sexual function\u00a0\u2013 there is less chance of erectile dysfunction and ejaculation problems. \n There's also less tissue injury, which means your recovery will be quicker and you won't need to stay in hospital as long. \n However, prostatic urethral lift implants\u00a0are unlikely to provide permanent symptom relief in all cases.

But some men may need more treatment in the future. \n Greenlight laser surgery (PVP) \n A laser can sometimes be used to destroy the prostate tissue. This particular form of TUVP is called photoselective vaporisation of the prostate (PVP), or Greenlight laser surgery. \n A thin, flexible instrument called a cytoscope is inserted into the urethra. A laser fibre is then passed through the\u00a0cytoscope to destroy the excess prostate tissue that is blocking the urine flow. \n The procedure is recommended for men with an enlarged prostate who don't have a high risk of developing complications from treatment, such as men who: \n \n don't have urinary retention \n don't have an increased risk of bleeding \n have a prostate smaller than 100ml \n \n In these \"low-risk\" men,\u00a0Greenlight laser surgery is thought to be as effective as TURP, but also has several benefits. \n These include: \n \n a shorter hospital stay\u00a0\u2013 the procedure is often carried out as a day case \n the catheter can be removed sooner\u00a0 \n recovery is quicker \n there's a lower risk of complications \n \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website has more information about  GreenLight XPS for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia . \n Open prostatectomy \n An open prostatectomy is a procedure that may be more effective than TURP if you have severe benign prostate enlargement. \n However, it's now rarely used, even for larger prostates,\u00a0because other techniques have been\u00a0developed, such as HoLEP. \n During an open prostatectomy, an\u00a0incision will be made in your tummy and the outer portion of your prostate will be removed. \n The procedure carries a higher risk of complications, such as  erectile dysfunction  and  urinary incontinence . There's also a greater chance that these complications will become permanent than if they occur after TURP.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "To find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you'll need to have a few tests. \n Some tests will be carried out by your GP and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems). \n First, your GP will ask about your symptoms. If it seems that you have  symptoms of benign prostate enlargement , the next stage is to calculate your\u00a0International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). \n International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) \n You'll be asked to complete\u00a0a\u00a0questionnaire\u00a0to assess your symptoms. Each question has\u00a0five possible answers that carry a score, and\u00a0your overall score\u00a0is used to assess the severity of your symptoms. \n The checklist includes the following questions. \n Over the past month: \n \n How often have you had the sensation of not completely emptying your bladder after urinating? \n How often have you had to urinate again less than two hours after finishing urinating? \n How often have you found that you stopped and started again when urinating? \n How often have you found it difficult to postpone urination? \n How often have you had a weak stream of urine? \n How often have you had to push or strain to begin urinating during the course of one night? \n How\u00a0often have\u00a0you had to\u00a0get up during the night to urinate? \n \n After your GP has assessed the severity your symptoms, they'll aim to rule\u00a0out other conditions\u00a0with similar symptoms using certain tests. \n Ruling out other conditions \n The\u00a0symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are similar to those of other conditions, including  prostate cancer . Therefore, your GP will need to be completely sure that your symptoms aren't caused by cancer. \n Urine tests \n A urine test can be used to check whether your symptoms are caused by an infection in your urinary system, such as a\u00a0 kidney infection  or bladder infection. \n Rectal examination \n You may need\u00a0a\u00a0rectal examination to check whether you might have prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can cause the prostate gland to become hard and bumpy. \n Your GP will put on a glove and lubricate one of their fingers, before gently pushing this finger into your bottom and up into your rectum. As the rectum is close to the prostate gland, they'll be able to check whether the surface of the gland has changed. The procedure will feel a little uncomfortable, but it isn't usually painful. \n Prostate cancer doesn't always cause changes to the prostate gland, so you may need to have some more specialised tests to rule it out. You will probably be referred to a urologist for these tests. \n Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test \n A blood test can be used to measure the amount of the PSA protein that's produced by the prostate. \n A raised PSA level indicates enlargement of the prostate, and a significantly raised level may indicate prostate cancer. However, as with a rectal examination, a PSA test can't provide a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer. \n Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) \n A TRUS is a type of  ultrasound scan  specifically designed to study the prostate and the surrounding area. \n An ultrasound probe is placed into your rectum and uses soundwaves to build a detailed image of your prostate. \n This type of scan measures the size of your prostate and can be used to either confirm or rule out a diagnosis of prostate cancer. \n Computer tomographic (CT) urogram \n A CT urogram is used to study the urinary tract (the bladder and the tubes through which urine passes, also known as the ureter and urethra). \n A CT urogram can be used to check for blockages in your urinary system that could be causing your symptoms, such as a\u00a0 kidney stone  or bladder stone. It can also be used to detect any damage in the urinary tract. \n During a CT urogram, you\u2019ll be injected with a harmless radioactive dye, which will be visible on  X-rays . After 30-60 minutes, the dye should have passed into your urinary tract and a series of X-rays will be taken. In some cases, you may be asked to pass urine before the final X-ray is taken. \n Voiding charts \n A voiding chart is a urination diary, which you may be asked to keep for 24 hours. You'll be asked to record how often you urinate, as well as details about how you urinate \u2013 for example, whether your urination is stopping and starting, or whether it's difficult to start urinating. \n A voiding chart is a good way of finding out more information about your symptoms and can be used to determine the type of treatment that would be most effective in controlling your symptoms. \n Uroflowmetry \n Uroflowmetry measures the pressure of your bladder and how well your bladder works when you urinate. \n You'll be given a\u00a0 local anaesthetic  and a small flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted into your urethra and moved up into your bladder. \n Water will then be injected through the catheter and into your bladder. A computer connected to the catheter measures the pressure inside your bladder and can assess how well your bladder is working. \n As with voiding charts, uroflowmetry is a good way of determining what type of treatment will help to control your symptoms."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)", "introduction": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. \n Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed\u00a0when children are 6 to 12 years old. \n The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems. \n People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of ADHD  \n Getting\u00a0help \n Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and doesn't necessarily mean they have ADHD. \n However, you should consider raising your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or GP if you think their behaviour may be different to most children their age. \n It's also a good idea to speak to your GP if you're an adult and you think you may have ADHD, but you weren't diagnosed with the condition as a child. \n Read more about  diagnosing ADHD  \n What causes ADHD? \n The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but\u00a0the condition has been shown to run in families. Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to those who don't have the condition. \n Other factors that have been suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include: \n \n being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) \n having a low birthweight \n smoking, alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy \n \n ADHD is more common in boys than girls.

This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD\u00a0can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious. \n Symptoms in children and teenagers \n The symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are well defined, and they're usually noticeable before the age of six. They occur in more than one situation, such as at home and at school. \n The main signs of each behavioural problem are detailed below. \n Inattentiveness \n The main signs of inattentiveness are: \n \n having a short attention span and being easily distracted \n making careless mistakes \u2013 for example, in schoolwork \n appearing forgetful or losing things \n being unable to stick at tasks that are tedious or time-consuming \n appearing to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions \n constantly changing activity or task \n having difficulty organising tasks \n \n Hyperactivity and\u00a0impulsiveness \n The main signs of hyperactivity and\u00a0impulsiveness are: \n \n being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings \n constantly fidgeting \n being unable to concentrate on tasks \n excessive physical movement \n excessive talking \n being unable to wait their turn \n acting without thinking \n interrupting conversations \n little or no sense of danger \n \n These\u00a0symptoms can cause significant problems in a child's life, such as\u00a0underachievement at school, poor social interaction with other children and adults, and problems with discipline. \n Related conditions in children and teenagers \n Although not always the case, some children may also have signs of other problems or conditions alongside ADHD, such as: \n \n  anxiety disorder  \u2013 which causes your child to worry and be nervous much of the time; it may also cause\u00a0physical symptoms, such as a rapid heartbeat, sweating and dizziness \n oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) \u2013 this is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers \n conduct disorder \u2013 this often involves\u00a0a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals \n  depression  \n sleep problems \u2013 finding it difficult to get to sleep at night, and having irregular sleeping patterns \n  autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)  \u2013 this affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour \n  epilepsy  \u2013 a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits or seizures \n Tourette\u2019s syndrome \u2013 a condition of the nervous system, characterised by a combination of involuntary noises and movements called tics \n learning difficulties \u2013 such as dyslexia \n \n Symptoms in adults \n In adults, the symptoms of ADHD are more difficult to define. This is largely due to a lack of research into adults with ADHD. \n ADHD is a developmental disorder; it's believed that it can't develop in adults without it first appearing during childhood. But it's known that symptoms of ADHD often persist from childhood into a person's teenage years, and then adulthood. \n Any additional problems or conditions experienced by children with ADHD, such as depression or dyslexia, may also continue into adulthood. \n By the age of 25, an estimated 15% of people diagnosed with ADHD as children still have a full range of symptoms, and 65% still have some symptoms that affect their daily lives. \n The symptoms in children and teenagers, which are listed above, is sometimes also applied to adults with possible ADHD. But some specialists say that the way in which inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness affect adults can be very different from the way they affect children. \n For example, hyperactivity tends to decrease in adults, while inattentiveness tends to get worse as the pressure of adult life increases. Adult symptoms of ADHD also tend to be far more subtle than childhood symptoms. \n Some specialists have suggested the following list of symptoms associated with ADHD in adults: \n \n carelessness and lack of attention to detail \n continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones \n poor organisational skills \n inability to focus or prioritise \n continually losing or misplacing things \n forgetfulness \n restlessness and edginess \n difficulty keeping quiet and speaking out of turn \n blurting out responses and often interrupting others \n mood swings, irritability and a quick temper \n inability to deal with stress \n extreme impatience \n taking risks in activities, often with little or no regard for personal safety or the safety of others \u2013 for example, driving dangerously \n \n Additional problems\u00a0in adults with ADHD \n As with ADHD in children and teenagers, ADHD in adults can\u00a0occur alongside\u00a0several related problems or conditions. \n One of the most common conditions is depression. Other conditions that\u00a0adults may have alongside ADHD include: \n \n  personality disorders  \u2013 conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others \n  bipolar disorder  \u2013 a condition that affects your moods, which can swing from one extreme to another \n  obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  \u2013 a condition that causes obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour \n \n The behavioural problems associated with ADHD can also cause problems such as difficulties with relationships, social interaction, drugs and crime. Some adults with ADHD\u00a0find it hard to find and\u00a0stay in\u00a0a job.", "causes": "The exact cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) isn't fully understood, although a combination of factors is thought to be responsible. \n Genetics \n ADHD tends to run in families and, in most cases, it's thought the genes you inherit from your parents are a significant factor in developing the condition. \n Research shows that both\u00a0parents and siblings of a child with ADHD are four to five times more likely to have ADHD themselves. \n However, the way ADHD is inherited is likely to be complex and isn't thought to be related to a single genetic fault. \n Brain function and structure \n Research has identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared to\u00a0those who don't have the condition, although the exact significance of these isn't clear. \n For example, studies involving\u00a0brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be smaller in people with ADHD, whereas other areas may be larger. \n Research has also\u00a0shown that the brain may take an average of two to three years longer to mature in children with ADHD, compared to children who don't have the condition. \n Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have an imbalance in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain, or that these chemicals\u00a0may not work properly. \n Other possible causes \n Various other\u00a0causes have also been suggested as playing a role in the development of ADHD, including: \n \n being born prematurely (before\u00a0the 37th week of pregnancy) \n having a low birthweight \n brain damage either in the womb or in the first few years of life \n drinking alcohol, smoking or misusing drugs while pregnant \n exposure to high levels of toxic lead at a young age \n \n However, the evidence for many of these factors is inconclusive, and more research is needed to determine\u00a0if they contribute to ADHD.", "treatment": "Treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can help relieve the symptoms and make the condition much less of a problem in day-to-day life. \n ADHD can be treated using medication or therapy, but a combination of both\u00a0is often best. \n Treatment\u00a0is usually arranged by a specialist, such as a paediatrician or psychiatrist, although the condition may be monitored by your GP.\u00a0 \n Medication \n There are\u00a0five types of medication licensed for the treatment of ADHD: \n \n methylphenidate\u00a0 \n dexamfetamine \n lisdexamfetamine \n atomoxetine \n guanfacine \n \n These medications aren't a permanent cure for ADHD, but\u00a0may help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer, and learn and practise new skills. \n Some medications need to be taken every day, but some can be taken just on school days. Treatment breaks are occasionally recommended, to assess whether the medication is still needed. \n In the UK, all of these medications are licensed for use in children and teenagers. Atomoxetine is also licensed for use in adults who had symptoms of ADHD as children. \n If you weren't diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood, your GP and specialist can discuss which medications and therapies are suitable for you. \n If you or your child is prescribed one of these medications, you'll probably be given small doses at first, which may then be gradually increased. You or your child will need to see your GP for regular check-ups, to ensure the treatment is working effectively and to check for signs of any side effects or problems. \n Your specialist will discuss how long you should take your treatment but, in many cases, treatment is continued for as long as it is helping. \n Methylphenidate \n Methylphenidate is the most commonly used medication for ADHD. It belongs to a group of medicines called stimulants that work by increasing activity in the brain, particularly in areas that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. \n Methylphenidate can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of six. Although methylphenidate isn't licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. \n The medication can be taken as either immediate-release tablets (small doses taken two to three times a day), or as modified-release tablets (taken once a day in the morning, and they release the dose throughout the day). \n Common side effects of\u00a0methylphenidate include: \n \n a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate \n loss of appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain \n trouble sleeping \n  headaches  \n  stomach aches  \n mood swings \n \n Dexamfetamine \n Dexamfetamine is also a stimulant medication, which works in a similar way to\u00a0methylphenidate by stimulating areas of the brain\u00a0that play a part in controlling attention and behaviour. \n Dexamfetamine can be used by teenagers and children with ADHD over the age of three. Although it's not licensed for use in adults, it may be taken under close supervision from your GP and specialist. \n Dexamfetamine is usually taken as a tablet once or twice a day, although an oral solution is also available. \n Common side effects of\u00a0dexamfetamine include: \n \n decreased appetite \n mood swings \n agitation and aggression \n dizziness \n headaches \n  diarrhoea  \n nausea and vomiting \n \n Lisdexamfetamine \n Lisdexamfetamine is a similar medication to\u00a0dexamfetamine, and\u00a0works in the same way. \n It can be used\u00a0by children with ADHD\u00a0over the age of six if treatment with methylphenidate hasn't helped.\u00a0You may continue to take it into adulthood if your doctor thinks you're benefitting from treatment. \n Lisdexamfetamine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once a day. \n Common side effects of lisdexamfetamine include: \n \n decreased appetite, which can lead to weight loss or poor weight gain \n aggression \n drowsiness \n dizziness \n headaches \n diarrhoea \n nausea and vomiting \n \n Atomoxetine \n Atomoxetine works differently to other ADHD medications. \n It's known as a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which means\u00a0it increases the amount of a chemical in the brain called noradrenaline. This chemical passes messages between brain cells, and\u00a0increasing the amount can aid concentration and help control impulses. \n Atomoxetine can be used by teenagers and children\u00a0over the age of six. It's also licensed for use in adults if symptoms of ADHD are confirmed. \n Atomoxetine comes in capsule form, which you or your child usually take once or twice a day. \n Common side effects of atomoxetine include: \n \n a small increase in blood pressure and heart rate \n nausea\u00a0and vomiting \n stomach aches \n trouble sleeping \n dizziness \n headaches \n irritability \n \n Atomoxetine has also been linked to some more serious side effects that it's important to look out for, including suicidal thoughts and liver damage. \n If either you or your child begin to feel depressed or suicidal while taking this medication, speak to your doctor. \n Guanfacine \n Guanfacine acts on part of the brain to improve attention and it also reduces blood pressure. \n It's used for ADHD in teenagers and children if other medicines are unsuitable or ineffective. \n Guanfacine is usually taken as a tablet once a day, in the morning or evening. \n Common side effects include: \n \n tiredness or fatigue \n headache \n abdominal pain \n dry mouth \n \n Therapy \n As well as taking medication, different therapies can be useful in treating ADHD in children, teenagers and adults. Therapy is also effective in treating\u00a0additional problems, such as conduct or anxiety disorders, that may appear\u00a0with ADHD. \n Some of the therapies that may be used are outlined below. \n Psychoeducation \n Psychoeducation means that you or your child will be encouraged to discuss ADHD and how it affects you. It can help children, teenagers and adults make sense of being diagnosed with ADHD, and can help you to cope and live with the condition. \n Behaviour therapy \n Behaviour therapy provides support for carers of children with ADHD, and may involve teachers as well as parents. Behaviour therapy usually involves behaviour management, which uses a system of rewards to encourage your child to try to control their ADHD. \n If your child has ADHD, you can identify types of behaviour you want to encourage, such as sitting at the table to eat. Your child is then given some sort of small reward for good behaviour, and removal of a privilege for poor behaviour. \n For teachers, behaviour management involves learning how to plan and structure activities, and to praise and encourage children for even very small amounts of progress. \n Parent training and education programmes \n If your child has ADHD, specially tailored parent training and education programmes can help you learn specific ways of talking to your child, and playing and working with them to improve their attention and behaviour. \n You may also be offered parent training before your child is formally diagnosed with ADHD. \n These programmes are usually arranged in groups of around 10-12 parents. A programme usually consists of 10-16 meetings, which each last up to two hours. \n They aim to teach parents and carers about behaviour management (see above), while increasing confidence in your ability to help your child and improve\u00a0your relationship.\u00a0 \n Social skills training \n Social skills training involves your child taking part in role play situations, and aims to teach them how to behave in social situations by learning how their behaviour affects others. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n  Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)  is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. A CBT therapist would try\u00a0to change how your child feels about a situation, which would in turn potentially change their behaviour. \n CBT can be carried out with a therapist individually or in a group. \n Other possible treatments \n There are other ways of treating ADHD that some people with the condition find helpful, such as cutting out certain foods and taking supplements. However, there's no strong evidence\u00a0these work, and they shouldn't be attempted without medical advice. \n Diet \n People with ADHD should eat a healthy, balanced diet.\u00a0Don't\u00a0cut out foods before seeking medical advice. \n Some people may notice a link between\u00a0types of food and worsening ADHD symptoms. For example, sugar, food colourings and additives,\u00a0and caffeine are often blamed for aggravating hyperactivity, and some people believe they have intolerances to wheat or dairy products, which may add to their symptoms. \n If this is the case, keep a diary of what you eat and drink, and what behaviour this causes. Discuss this with your GP, who may refer you to a dietitian (a healthcare professional who specialises in nutrition). \n Supplements \n Some studies have suggested\u00a0that supplements of\u00a0omega-3\u00a0and omega-6 fatty acids\u00a0may be beneficial in people with ADHD, although\u00a0the evidence supporting this is very limited. \n It's advisable to\u00a0talk to your GP before using\u00a0any supplements, because\u00a0some can react unpredictably with medication or make it less effective. \n You should also remember that some supplements shouldn't be taken long term, as they can reach dangerous levels in your body.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you think that you or your child may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), you might want to consider speaking to your GP about it. \n If you're worried about your child, it may help to speak to their teachers before seeing your GP, to find out\u00a0if\u00a0they\u00a0have any concerns about your child's behaviour. \n Your GP can't formally diagnose ADHD, but they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary. \n When you see your GP, they may ask you: \n \n about your symptoms\u00a0or those of your child \n when these symptoms started \n where the symptoms occur \u2013 for example, at home or in school \n whether\u00a0the symptoms affect your or your child\u2019s day-to-day life \u2013 for example, if they make socialising difficult \n if there have been any recent significant events in your\u00a0life or your child's, such as\u00a0a death or divorce in the family \n if there's a family history of ADHD \n about any other problems or symptoms of different health conditions you or your child may have \n \n Next steps \n If your GP thinks your child may have ADHD, they may first suggest a period of \"watchful waiting\" lasting around 10 weeks \u2013 to see if your child's symptoms improve, stay the same or get worse. They may also suggest\u00a0starting a parent training or education programme to teach you ways of helping your child (see\u00a0 treating ADHD  for more information). \n If your child's behaviour doesn't improve, and both you and your GP\u00a0believe it's seriously affecting their day-to-day life, your GP should refer you and your child to a specialist for a formal assessment (see below). \n For adults with possible ADHD, your GP will assess your symptoms and may refer you for an assessment if: \n \n you weren't diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but your symptoms began during childhood and have been ongoing since then \n your symptoms can't be explained by a mental health condition \n your symptoms have a\u00a0significant impact on your day-to-day life \u2013 for example, if you're underachieving at work or find intimate relationships difficult \n \n You may also be referred to a specialist if you had ADHD as a child or young person, and your symptoms are now causing moderate or severe functional impairment. \n Assessment \n There are a number of different specialists that you or your child may be referred to for a formal assessment, including: \n \n a child or adult psychiatrist \n a paediatrician (a specialist in children's health) \n a\u00a0learning disability specialist, social worker or occupational therapist with expertise in ADHD \n \n Who you're referred to depends on your age and what's available in your local area. \n There's no simple test to determine whether you or your child have ADHD, but your specialist can make an accurate diagnosis after a detailed assessment that may include: \n \n a physical examination, which can help rule out other possible causes for the symptoms \n a series of interviews with you or your child \n interviews or reports from other significant people, such as partners, parents and teachers \n \n The criteria for making a diagnosis of ADHD in children, teenagers and adults are outlined below. \n Diagnosis in children and teenagers \n Diagnosing ADHD in children depends on a set of strict criteria. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must have six or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness. \n To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must also have: \n \n been displaying symptoms continuously for at least six months \n started to show symptoms before the age of\u00a012 \n been showing symptoms in at least two different settings \u2013 for example, at home and at school, to rule out the possibility that the behaviour is just a reaction to certain teachers or parental control \n symptoms that make their lives considerably more difficult on a social, academic or occupational level \n symptoms that aren't just part of a developmental disorder or difficult phase, and aren't better accounted for by another condition \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of ADHD  \n Diagnosis in adults \n Diagnosing ADHD in adults is more difficult because there's some disagreement about whether the list of symptoms used to diagnose children and teenagers also applies to adults. \n In some cases, an adult may be diagnosed with ADHD if they have five or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or five or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness, that are listed in diagnostic criteria for\u00a0children with ADHD. \n As part of your assessment, the specialist will ask about your present symptoms. However, under\u00a0current diagnostic guidelines, a diagnosis of ADHD in adults can't be confirmed unless your symptoms have been present from childhood. \n If you find it difficult to remember whether you had problems as a child, or you weren't diagnosed with ADHD when you were younger, your specialist may wish to see your old school records or talk to your parents, teachers or anyone else who knew you well when you were a child. \n For an adult to be diagnosed with ADHD, their symptoms should also have a moderate impact on different areas of their life, such as: \n \n underachieving at work or in education \n driving dangerously \n difficultly making or keeping friends \n difficulty in relationships with partners \n \n If your problems are recent and didn't occur regularly in the past, you're not considered to have ADHD.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)", "introduction": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. \n In children with ASD, the symptoms are present before three years of age, although a diagnosis can sometimes be made after the age of three. \n It's estimated that about\u00a01 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls. \n There's no \"cure\" for ASD, but speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, educational support, plus a number of other interventions are available to help children and parents. \n Read about  help and support available for people with ASD  \n Signs and symptoms \n People with ASD\u00a0tend to have problems\u00a0with social interaction and communication. \n In early infancy, some children with ASD don\u2019t babble or use other vocal sounds. Older children have problems using non-verbal behaviours to interact with others \u2013 for example, they have difficulty with eye contact, facial expressions, body language and gestures. They may give no or brief eye contact and ignore familiar or unfamiliar people. \n Children with ASD may also lack awareness of and interest in other children. They\u2019ll often either gravitate to older or younger children, rather than interacting with children of the same age. They tend to play alone. \n They can find it hard to understand other people's emotions and feelings, and have difficulty starting conversations or taking part in them properly. Language development may be delayed, and a child with ASD won\u2019t compensate their lack of language or delayed language skills by using gestures (body language) or facial expressions. \n Children with ASD will tend to repeat words or phrases spoken by others (either immediately or later) without formulating their own language, or in parallel to developing their language skills. Some children don\u2019t demonstrate imaginative or pretend play, while others will continually repeat the same pretend play. \n Some children with ASD like to stick to the same routine and little changes may trigger tantrums. Some children may flap their hand or twist or flick their fingers when they\u2019re excited or upset. Others may engage in repetitive activity, such as turning light switches on and off, opening and closing doors, or lining things up. \n Children and young people with ASD frequently experience a range of cognitive (thinking),\u00a0learning, emotional and behavioural problems. For example, they may also\u00a0have  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ,  anxiety , or  depression . \n About 70% of children with ASD have a non-verbal IQ below 70. Of these,\u00a050% have a non-verbal IQ below 50. Overall, up to 50% of\u00a0people with \"severe learning difficulties\" have an ASD. \n Read more about the  symptoms of ASD  \n Getting a diagnosis \n The main features of ASD \u2013 problems with social communication and\u00a0interaction \u2013\u00a0can often be recognised during early childhood. \n Some features of ASD may not become noticeable until a change of situation, such as when the child starts nursery or school. \n See your GP or health visitor if you notice any of the signs and symptoms of ASD in your child, or if you're concerned about your child's development.\u00a0It can also be helpful to discuss your concerns with your child's nursery or school. \n Read more about  diagnosing ASD  \n Caring for someone with ASD \n Being a carer isn't an easy role. When you're busy responding to the needs of others, it can affect\u00a0your emotional and physical energy, and make it easy to forget your own health and mental wellbeing. \n If you're caring for someone else, it's important to look after yourself and get as much help as possible. It's in your best interests and those of the person you care for. \n Read more about  care and support , including information on: \n \n  carers' assessments  \n support and the  benefits carers are entitled to  \n  carers' breaks and respite care  \n \n What causes ASD? \n The exact cause of ASD is unknown, but it's thought that several complex genetic and environmental factors are involved. \n In the past, some people believed the  MMR vaccine \u00a0caused ASD, but this has been investigated extensively in a number of major studies around the world, involving millions of children, and researchers have found no evidence of a link between MMR and ASD. \n Read more about the  causes of ASD  \n Autism in adults \n Some people with ASD had features of the condition as a child, but enter adulthood without ever being diagnosed. \n However, getting a diagnosis as an adult can often help a person with ASD and their families understand the condition, and work out what type of advice and support they need. \n For example, a number of autism-specific services are available\u00a0that provide adults with ASD with\u00a0the help and support they need to live independently and find a job that matches their skills and abilities. \n Read more about  adults with ASD", "symptoms": "The main features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are problems with social communication and interaction.

inappropriately", "causes": "The exact cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is currently unknown. \n It's a complex condition and may occur as a result of genetic predisposition (a natural tendency), environmental or unknown factors. \n Genes \n Most researchers believe that certain genes a child inherits from their parents could make them more vulnerable to developing ASD. \n Cases of ASD have been known to run in families. For example, younger siblings of children with ASD can also develop the condition, and it's common for identical twins to both develop ASD. \n No specific genes linked to ASD have been identified, but it may be a presenting feature of some rare genetic syndromes, including Fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome and Angelman syndrome. \n Environmental triggers \n Some researchers believe that a person born with a\u00a0genetic vulnerability to ASD only develops the condition if they're exposed to a specific environmental trigger. \n Possible\u00a0triggers include being born prematurely (before 35 weeks of pregnancy), or being exposed in the womb\u00a0to alcohol or to certain medication, such as sodium valproate (sometimes used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy). \n No conclusive evidence has been found linking pollution or maternal infections in pregnancy with an increased risk of ASD. \n Other health conditions \n Below are some other conditions known to be associated with ASD: \n \n muscular dystrophy\u00a0\u2013 a group of inherited genetic conditions that gradually cause the muscles to weaken \n  Down's syndrome \u00a0\u2013 a genetic condition that typically causes a learning disability and a range of physical features \n cerebral palsy \u2013 conditions that affect the brain and nervous system, causing problems with movement and co-ordination \n infantile spasms \u2013 a type of\u00a0 epilepsy  that develops while a child is still very young (usually before they're one year old) \n neurofibromatosis \u2013 a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves (the main types are neurofibromatosis type 1 and neurofibromatosis type 2) \n the rare genetic conditions fragile X syndrome,\u00a0tuberous sclerosis\u00a0andRett syndrome", "treatment": "There's no 'cure' for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, a range of specialist educational and behavioural programmes can help children with ASD. \n It can be difficult\u00a0to know which intervention will work best for your child, because each person with ASD is affected differently. \n Some types of intervention can involve hours of intensive work, and this isn't always possible for many families because of the practical, emotional and financial commitments necessary. \n The National Autistic Society website has information about the many different  strategies and approaches available for ASD   . \n Any intervention should focus on important aspects of your child's development. These are: \n \n communication skills \u2013 such as using pictures to help communicate (as speech and language skills are usually significantly delayed) \n social interaction skills \u2013 such as the ability to understand other people's feelings and respond to them \n imaginative play skills \u2013 such as encouraging pretend play \n academic skills \u2013 the \"traditional\" skills a child needs to progress with their education, such as reading, writing and maths \n \n The  detailed assessment , management and co-ordination of care for children and young people with ASD should involve local specialist community-based\u00a0multidisciplinary teams (sometimes called \"local autism teams\") working together. The team may include: \n \n a paediatrician \n mental heath specialists, such as a psychologist and psychiatrist \n a learning disability specialist \n a speech and language therapist \n an occupational therapist \n education and social care services \n \n Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with ASD has a case manager or key worker to manage and co-ordinate their treatment, care and support, as well as their transition into adult care. \n The Research Autism website provides details of the many different\u00a0 types of autism interventions, treatments and therapies . \n Parent education and training \n The parents of a child with ASD play a crucial role in supporting their child and improving their skills. \n If your child has ASD, it's a good idea\u00a0to find out as much as you can about the condition. The National Autistic Society website\u00a0provides useful information and  advice for\u00a0parents, relatives and carers . \n The Research Autism website is also a good source of information and has a section about the different issues that living with autism presents, including the  impact of autism on the family . \n Communication advice for parents \n Communication is particularly challenging for children with ASD. Helping your child to communicate can reduce anxiety and improve behaviour. \n The following tips may be useful when communicating and interacting with your child: \n \n use your child's name, so they know you're addressing them \n keep background noise to a minimum \n keep language simple \n speak slowly and clearly, with pauses between words \n accompany what you say with simple gestures \n allow extra time for your child to process what you've said\u00a0 \n \n Parent support programmes \n In-depth advice and support programmes are available for parents of children recently diagnosed with ASD. \n For example, the\u00a0 EarlyBird  programme provided by The National Autistic Society is a free three-month course for parents whose child has been diagnosed with ASD, but hasn't started school yet. \n The programme aims to inform and support parents, and offers practical advice about looking after their child and helping them improve their skills. \n  EarlyBird Plus \u00a0is for parents of children who have received a later diagnosis of ASD and are four to eight years of age.\u00a0The programme aims to address the child's needs at both home and school by training parents and carers,\u00a0together with a professional who regularly works\u00a0with their child. \n EarlyBird and EarlyBird Plus programmes are run by licensed teams and are\u00a0available in most\u00a0parts of the UK. To find out if there's a team in your area, call  01226 779218  or email  earlybird@nas.org.uk . \n Psychological treatments \n If your child's behaviour is causing problems, they'll be assessed for possible triggers, such as a physical health condition, mental health problem, or environmental factors. \n In cases where a child with ASD also has a mental health problem, such as  anxiety , a psychological treatment may be offered. \n Psychological treatments, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), involve talking to a trained therapist about thoughts and feelings, and discussing how these affect behaviour and wellbeing. \n You can read\u00a0more about\u00a0 CBT and autism    on the Research Autism website. \n Medication \n In some cases, medication may be prescribed to treat some of the symptoms or conditions associated with ASD. For example: \n \n  sleeping problems  \u2013 this\u00a0may be treated with a medication such as melatonin \n  depression \u00a0\u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication known as\u00a0a  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  \n  epilepsy  \u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication called an anticonvulsant \n  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \u00a0\u2013 this may be treated with a medication such as methylphenidate \n aggressive and challenging behaviour, such as tantrums or self-harming\u00a0\u2013 this may be treated with a type of medication called an antipsychotic if the behaviour is severe or psychological treatments haven't helped \n \n These medications can have significant side effects and are usually only prescribed by a doctor who specialises in the condition being treated. If medication is offered, your child will have regular check-ups to assess whether it's working. \n Treatments not recommended \n A number of alternative treatments have been suggested for ASD. However, these should be avoided, because there's little or no evidence that they're effective and some may even be potentially dangerous. \n Treatments that aren't recommended for ASD include: \n \n special diets \u2013 such as gluten-free or casein-free diets \n neurofeedback \u2013 where brain activity is monitored (usually by placing\u00a0electrodes on the head) and the person being treated can see their brain activity on a screen and is taught how to change it \n auditory integration training \u2013 a therapy that involves listening to music that varies in tone, pitch and volume \n chelation therapy\u00a0\u2013 which uses medication or other agents to remove metal (in particular, mercury) from the body \n hyperbaric oxygen therapy \u2013 treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber \n facilitated communication \u2013 where a therapist or another person supports and guides a person's hand or arm while using a device such as a computer keyboard or mouse", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "See your GP or health visitor if your child is showing  symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) , or you're worried about their development. \n If appropriate, your GP can refer you to a healthcare professional or team who specialise in diagnosing ASD, or someone who has access to such a team. \n The specialist or specialist team will make a more in-depth assessment, which should\u00a0be started within three months of the\u00a0referral. \n If you're referred to an individual specialist, they may be a: \n \n psychologist \u2013 a healthcare professional with a psychology degree, plus further training and qualifications in psychology \n psychiatrist \u2013 a medically qualified doctor with further training in psychiatry \n paediatrician \u2013 a doctor who specialises in treating children \n speech and language therapist \u2013\u00a0a specialist in recognising and treating communication problems \n \n Some local health authorities use multidisciplinary teams. These are a combination of specialists who work together to make an assessment. \n Assessment \n A\u00a0diagnosis of ASD is based on the range of features your child is showing. \n For most children: \n \n information will be needed from your GP, nursery or school staff, plus speech and language and occupational therapists, about your child's development, health and behaviour \n a speech and language therapist, and often\u00a0an occupational therapist, will carry out an assessment \n a detailed physical examination will need to be carried out to rule out possible physical causes of your child's symptoms, such as an underlying condition like\u00a0neurofibromatosis or\u00a0 Down's syndrome \u00a0 \n the assessment will include a check for any coexisting physical health conditions and mental health problems \n \n In addition, for some children: \n \n you may be asked to attend a series of interviews so a detailed family history and the history of your child's development and behaviour can be drawn up \n your child may be asked to attend a series of appointments so specific skills and activities can be observed and assessed\u00a0 \n \n Once this process is complete, a diagnosis of ASD may be confirmed. \n After diagnosis \n When a child is diagnosed with ASD, many parents are keen to find out as much as they can about the condition.\u00a0The  National Autistic Society \u00a0has an excellent range of resources and advice. \n Diagnosing ASD in adults \n Some people with ASD grow up without their condition being recognised, but it's never too late to get a diagnosis. Some people may be scared of being diagnosed because they feel it will \"label\" them, and lower other people's expectations of them.\u00a0 \n But there are several advantages to getting a diagnosis. It\u00a0helps people with the condition and their families understand ASD and decide what sort of support they need. A diagnosis may also make it easier to access autism-specific services and claim benefits. \n See your GP if you think you may have ASD and ask them to refer you to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist.\u00a0 \n If you're already seeing a specialist for other reasons, you may want to ask them for a referral instead. \n Read more about  diagnosing ASD in adults  and  advice for adults living with ASD . \n You can also read the NICE guidelines\u00a0about the  recognition, referral, diagnosis and management of adults on the autism spectrum (PDF, 267kb) ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Atopic eczema", "introduction": "Atopic eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of eczema. It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults. \n Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. It is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people, although it can improve over time, especially in children. \n Atopic eczema\u00a0can affect any part of the body,\u00a0but the most common areas to be affected are: \n \n backs or fronts of\u00a0the knees \n outside or inside of the elbows \n around the neck \n hands \n cheeks \n scalp \n \n People with atopic eczema usually\u00a0have periods when symptoms are less noticeable, as well as periods when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups). \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of atopic eczema \u00a0and  diagnosing atopic eczema . \n What causes atopic eczema? \n The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown, but it's clear it's not down to one single thing. It often occurs in people who get  allergies \u00a0\u2013 \"atopic\" means sensitivity to allergens. \n It\u00a0can run in families, and often\u00a0develops alongside other conditions, such as\u00a0 asthma  and  hay fever . \n The symptoms of atopic eczema\u00a0often have certain\u00a0triggers, such as\u00a0soaps, detergents, stress and the weather.\u00a0Sometimes\u00a0 food allergies  can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema. \n Read\u00a0more about the\u00a0 causes of atopic eczema . \n Treating atopic eczema\u00a0 \n There is currently no cure for atopic eczema, but treatment can\u00a0help relieve the symptoms and many cases improve over time. \n However, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life and may be difficult to\u00a0cope with physically and mentally. There is also an increased risk of skin infections.\u00a0 \n Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including: \n \n self care techniques,\u00a0such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers \n emollients\u00a0(moisturising treatments)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0used on a daily basis for dry skin\u00a0 \n  topical corticosteroids \u00a0\u2013\u00a0used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups \n \n Read more about\u00a0 treating\u00a0atopic eczema \u00a0and the  complications of atopic eczema . \n Who is affected? \n About 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0children in the UK has atopic eczema. In 8 out of 10 cases, the condition develops before a child reaches the age of 5. Many children develop it before their first birthday. \n Atopic eczema can improve significantly, or even clear completely, in some children as they get older. About half of all cases improve a lot by the time a child reaches 11 years, and around two-thirds improve\u00a0by the age of 16. \n However, the condition can continue into adulthood and can sometimes develop for the first time in adults.", "symptoms": "Atopic eczema causes areas of skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red. \n There will usually be periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). Flare-ups may occur as often as 2\u00a0or 3\u00a0times a month. \n Atopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. The face is more commonly involved in adults. \n The severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching. \n Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work. \n Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It's not\u00a0a result of\u00a0scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a \"footprint\" of old inflammation\u00a0and will eventually return to its normal colour. \n Signs of an infection \n Occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include: \n \n your eczema getting a lot worse \n fluid oozing from the skin \n a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema \n the skin becoming swollen and sore \n a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell \n \n See your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected. \n Read more about infections and other\u00a0 complications of atopic eczema .", "causes": "Atopic eczema is likely to be caused by a combination of things. \n People with atopic eczema often have very dry skin because their skin is unable to retain\u00a0much moisture. \n This dryness may make\u00a0the skin more likely to react to certain triggers, causing it to become red and itchy. \n You may be born with an increased likelihood of developing atopic eczema because of the genes you inherit from your parents. \n Research has shown children who have 1\u00a0or both parents with atopic eczema, or who have other siblings with eczema, are more likely to develop it themselves. \n Atopic eczema is not infectious, so it cannot be passed on through close contact. \n Eczema triggers \n There are a number of things that may trigger your eczema symptoms. These can vary from person to person. \n Common\u00a0triggers include: \n \n irritants \u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0soaps and detergents, including shampoo, washing up liquid\u00a0and bubble bath \n environmental factors or  allergens \u00a0\u2013 such as cold and dry weather, dampness, and more specific things such as house dust mites, pet fur, pollen and moulds \n  food allergies  \u2013 such as allergies to\u00a0cows' milk, eggs, peanuts, soya or wheat \n certain\u00a0materials worn next to the skin \u2013 such as wool and synthetic fabrics \n hormonal changes \u2013 women may find their symptoms get worse in the days before their period or during pregnancy \n skin infections \n \n Some people also report their symptoms get worse when the air is dry or dusty, or when they are stressed,\u00a0sweaty, or too hot or too cold. \n If you are diagnosed with atopic eczema, your GP will work with you to try to identify any triggers for your symptoms. Read more about  diagnosing atopic eczema .", "treatment": "There is no cure for atopic eczema, but treatments can ease the symptoms. Many children find their symptoms naturally improve as they get older. \n The main treatments for atopic eczema are: \n \n emollients\u00a0(moisturisers) \u2013 used every day to stop the skin becoming dry \n  topical corticosteroids \u00a0\u2013\u00a0creams and ointments used to reduce swelling and redness during flare-ups \n \n Other treatments include topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus for eczema in sensitive sites not responding to simpler treatment,\u00a0antihistamines for severe itching, bandages or special body suits to allow the body to heal underneath, or more powerful treatments offered by a dermatologist (skin specialist). \n The various treatments for\u00a0atopic eczema are outlined below.\u00a0 \n Self care \n As well as the treatments mentioned above, there are things\u00a0you can\u00a0do yourself to help ease\u00a0your symptoms and prevent further problems.\u00a0 \n Try to reduce the damage from scratching \n Eczema is often itchy and it can be very tempting to scratch the affected areas of skin. But scratching usually damages the skin, which can itself cause more eczema to occur. \n The skin eventually thickens into leathery areas as a result of chronic scratching. Deep scratching also causes bleeding and increases the risk of your skin becoming infected or scarred. \n Try to reduce scratching whenever possible. You could try gently rubbing your skin with your fingers instead. If your baby has atopic eczema, anti-scratch mittens may stop them scratching their skin. \n Keep your nails short and clean to minimise damage to the skin from unintentional scratching. Keep your skin covered with light clothing to reduce damage from habitual scratching. \n Avoid triggers \n Your GP will work with you to\u00a0establish what might\u00a0trigger the eczema flare-ups, although\u00a0it may get better or worse for no obvious reason. \n Once you know\u00a0your triggers, you can try to avoid them.\u00a0For example: \n \n if certain fabrics irritate your skin, avoid wearing these and stick to soft, fine-weave clothing or natural materials such as cotton \n if heat aggravates your eczema, keep the rooms in your home cool, especially the bedroom \n avoid using soaps or detergents that may affect your skin\u00a0\u2013 use soap substitutes instead \n \n Although\u00a0some people with eczema are allergic to house dust mites, trying to rid your home of them isn't recommended\u00a0as it can be difficult and there is no clear evidence that it helps. \n Read more about  preventing allergies . \n Dietary changes \n Some foods, such as eggs and cows' milk, can trigger eczema symptoms. However, you should not make significant changes to your diet without first speaking to your GP. \n It may not be healthy to cut these foods from your diet, especially in young children who need the calcium, calories and protein from these foods. \n If your GP suspects you have a\u00a0 food allergy , you may be referred to a dietitian (a specialist in diet and nutrition), who can help work out a way to avoid the food you're allergic to while ensuring you still get all the nutrition you need. \n Alternatively, you may be referred to a hospital specialist such as an immunologist, dermatologist or paediatrician. \n If you are breastfeeding a baby with atopic eczema, get medical advice before making any changes to your regular diet. \n Emollients \n Emollients are moisturising treatments applied directly to the skin to reduce water loss and cover it with a protective film. They are often used to help manage dry or scaly skin conditions such as atopic eczema. \n In addition to making the skin feel less dry, they may also have a mild anti-inflammatory role, and can help reduce the number of flare-ups you have. \n Choosing an\u00a0emollient \n Several different emollients are available. You may need to try a few to find one that works for you. You may also be advised to use a mix of emollients, such as: \n \n an ointment for very dry skin \n a cream or lotion for less dry skin \n an emollient to use instead of soap \n an emollient to add to bath water or use in the shower \n one emollient to use on your face and hands, and a different one to use on your body \n \n The difference between lotions, creams and ointments is the amount of oil they contain. Ointments contain the most oil so they can be quite greasy, but are the most effective at keeping moisture in the skin. \n Lotions contain the least amount of oil so are not greasy, but can be less effective. Creams are somewhere in between. \n If you have been using a particular emollient for some time, it may eventually become less effective or may start to irritate your skin. \n If this is the case, your GP will be able to prescribe another product that suits you better. The best emollient is the one you feel happy using every day. \n How to use emollients \n Use your emollient all the time, even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Many people find it helpful to keep separate supplies of emollients at work or school, or a tub in the bathroom and one in a living area. \n To apply the emollient: \n \n use a large amount \n don't rub it in\u00a0\u2013 smooth it into the skin in the same direction the hair grows instead \n after a bath or shower, gently pat the skin dry and\u00a0apply the emollient while the skin is still moist to keep the moisture in \n \n You should use an emollient at least twice a day if you can, or more often if you have very dry skin. \n During a flare-up, apply generous amounts of emollient more frequently, but remember to treat inflamed skin with a topical corticosteroid\u00a0as emollients used\u00a0on their own\u00a0are not enough to control it. \n Don't put your fingers into an emollient pot \u2013 use a spoon or pump dispenser instead, as this reduces the risk of infection. And never share your emollient with other people. \n Topical corticosteroids \n If your skin is sore and inflamed, your GP may prescribe a topical corticosteroid (applied directly to your skin), which can reduce the inflammation within a few days. \n Topical corticosteroids can be prescribed in different strengths, depending on the severity of your atopic eczema and the areas of skin affected. \n They can be very mild (such as hydrocortisone), moderate (such as clobetasone butyrate), or even stronger (such as mometasone). \n If you need to use corticosteroids frequently, see your GP regularly so they can check the treatment is working effectively and you are using the right amount. \n How to use topical corticosteroids \n Don't be afraid to apply the treatment to affected areas to control your eczema. Unless instructed otherwise by your doctor, follow the directions on the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. This will give details of how much to apply. \n Most people will only have to apply it once a day as there is no evidence there is any benefit to applying it more often. \n When using a topical corticosteroid: \n \n apply your emollient first and ideally wait around 30 minutes until the emollient has soaked into your skin, or apply the corticosteroid at a different time of day (such as at night) \n apply the recommended amount of the topical corticosteroid to the affected area \n continue to use it until 48 hours after the flare-up has cleared so the inflammation under the skin surface is treated \n \n Occasionally, your doctor may suggest using a topical corticosteroid less frequently, but over a longer period of time. This is designed\u00a0to help prevent flare-ups. \n This is sometimes called \"weekend treatment\", where a person who has already gained control of their eczema uses the topical corticosteroid every weekend on the trouble sites to prevent them becoming active again. \n Side effects \n Topical corticosteroids may cause a mild stinging sensation for less than a minute as you apply them. \n In rare cases, they may also cause: \n \n thinning of the skin\u00a0\u2013 especially if the strong steroids are used in the wrong places, such as the face, for too long (for example, several weeks) \n changes in skin colour\u00a0\u2013 usually, skin\u00a0lightening after many months of using very strong steroids, but most lightening\u00a0after eczema is a \"footprint\" of old inflammation and nothing to do with treatments \n  acne  (spots)\u00a0\u2013 especially when used on the face in teenagers \n increased hair growth \n \n Most of these side effects will improve once treatment stops. \n Generally, using a strong topical corticosteroid for many months,\u00a0using them in sensitive areas such as the\u00a0face, armpits or groin, or using a large amount will increase your risk of side effects. For this reason, you should be prescribed the weakest effective treatment to control your symptoms. \n Antihistamines\u00a0 \n Antihistamines are a type of medicine that blocks the effects of a substance in the blood called histamine. They\u00a0can help relieve the itching associated with atopic eczema. \n They can either\u00a0be sedating, which cause drowsiness,\u00a0or\u00a0non-sedating. If you have severe itching, your GP may suggest trying\u00a0a non-sedating antihistamine. \n If itching during a flare-up affects your sleep, your GP may suggest taking a sedating\u00a0antihistamine. Sedating\u00a0antihistamines can cause drowsiness into the following day, so it may be helpful to let your child's school know they may not be as alert as normal. \n Bandages and wet wraps \n In some cases, your GP may prescribe special medicated bandages, clothing or wet wraps to wear over areas of skin affected by eczema.\u00a0 \n These can either be used over emollients or with topical corticosteroids to prevent scratching, allow the skin underneath to heal, and stop the skin drying out. \n Corticosteroid tablets \n  Corticosteroid tablets \u00a0are rarely used to treat atopic eczema nowadays, but may occasionally be prescribed for short periods of 5\u00a0to 7\u00a0days to help bring particularly severe flare-ups under control. \n Longer courses of treatment are generally avoided because of the risk of potentially serious side effects. \n If your GP thinks your condition may be severe enough to benefit from repeated or prolonged treatment with corticosteroid tablets, they will probably refer you to a specialist. \n Seeing a specialist \n In some cases, your GP may refer you to a specialist in treating skin conditions (dermatologist). \n You may be referred if your GP is not sure what type of eczema you have, normal treatment is not controlling your eczema, your eczema is affecting your daily life, or it's not clear what is causing it. \n A dermatologist may be able to offer the following: \n \n a thorough review of your existing treatment \u2013 to make sure you are using enough of the right things at the right times \n topical calcineurin inhibitors \u2013 creams and ointments that suppress your immune system, such as\u00a0pimecrolimus and tacrolimus \n very strong topical corticosteroids \n bandages or wet wraps \n phototherapy \u2013 ultraviolet (UV) light that reduces inflammation \n immunosuppressant tablets \u2013 to suppress your immune system, such as azathioprine, ciclosporin and methotrexate \n alitretinoin \u2013 medicine to treat severe eczema affecting the hands in adults \n \n A dermatologist may also offer additional support to help you use your treatments correctly, such as demonstrations from nurse specialists, and they may be able to refer you for psychological support if you feel you\u00a0need it.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will usually be able to diagnose atopic eczema by looking at your skin and asking questions about your symptoms. \n These questions may include asking: \n \n whether the rash is itchy and where it appears \n when the symptoms first began \n whether it comes and goes over time \n whether there is a history of atopic eczema in your family \n whether you have any other conditions, such as  allergies  or\u00a0 asthma  \n \n You should tell your GP if your condition is affecting your quality of life\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you\u00a0have difficulty sleeping because of itching, or\u00a0your eczema limits your everyday\u00a0activities. \n Checklist for diagnosing atopic eczema \n Typically, to be diagnosed with atopic eczema you should have had an itchy skin condition in the last 12 months and 3\u00a0or more of the following: \n \n visibly irritated red skin in the creases of your skin, such as the insides of your elbows or behind your knees (or on the cheeks, outsides of elbows, or fronts of the knees in children aged 18 months or under) at the time of examination by a health professional \n a history of skin irritation occurring in the same areas mentioned above \n generally dry skin in the last 12 months \n a history of asthma or\u00a0 hay fever  \u2013 children under 4\u00a0must have an immediate relative, such as a parent, brother or sister, who has one of these conditions \n the condition started before the age of 2\u00a0(this does not apply to children under the age of 4) \n \n Establishing triggers \n Your GP should work with you to establish if any triggers make your eczema worse.\u00a0 \n You may be asked about your diet and lifestyle to see if something obvious may be contributing to your symptoms. For example, you may have noticed some soaps or shampoos make the eczema worse. \n You may also be asked to keep a food diary to try to determine whether a specific food makes your symptoms worse. \n A food diary involves writing down everything you eat and making a record of any eczema flare-ups you have. Your GP can then use the diary to see if there is a pattern between your symptoms and what you eat. \n  Allergy tests \u00a0are not usually needed to identify triggers, although they are sometimes helpful in identifying food allergies that may be triggering symptoms in young children or in those where a food allergy is suspected. \n Read more about  triggers and causes of atopic eczema ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Asthma", "introduction": "Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness. \n The severity of these symptoms varies from person to person. Asthma can be controlled well in most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems. \n Occasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an \"asthma attack\", although doctors sometimes use the term \"exacerbation\". \n Severe\u00a0attacks may require hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual. \n Read more about the  symptoms of asthma \u00a0and  diagnosing asthma  \n What causes asthma? \n Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal. \n When you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs \u2013 known as a trigger \u2013 your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm). \n Common asthma triggers include: \n \n house dust mites \n animal fur \n pollen \n cigarette\u00a0smoke \n exercise \n viral infections \n \n Asthma may also be triggered by substances (allergens or chemicals) inhaled while at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday. \n The reason why some people develop asthma is not fully understood, although it is known that you are more likely to develop it if you have a family history of the condition. \n Asthma can develop at any age,\u00a0including in young children and elderly people. \n Read more about the  causes of asthma  \n Who is affected? \n In the UK, around 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma. \n That's the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and\u00a01 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men. \n How\u00a0asthma is treated \n While there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition. \n Treatment is based on two important goals, which are: \n \n relieving symptoms\u00a0 \n preventing future symptoms and attacks \n \n For most people, this will involve the occasional \u2013 or, more commonly, daily \u2013 use of medications, usually taken using an inhaler. However, identifying and avoiding possible triggers is also important. \n You should have a personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse that includes information about the medicines you need to take, how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse, and what steps to take when they do so. \n Read more about  treating asthma \u00a0and\u00a0 living with asthma  \n Outlook \n For many people, asthma is a long-term condition \u2013 particularly if it first develops in adulthood. \n Asthma symptoms are usually controllable and reversible with treatment, although some people with\u00a0long-lasting asthma may\u00a0develop permanent narrowing of their airways and more persistent problems. \u00a0 \n For children diagnosed with asthma, the condition may disappear or improve during the teenage years, although it can return later in life. Moderate or severe childhood asthma is more likely to persist or return later on.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of asthma can range from mild to severe. Most people will only experience occasional symptoms, although a few people will have problems most of the time. \n The main symptoms of asthma are: \n \n wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe) \n shortness of breath \n a tight chest \u2013 which may feel like\u00a0a band is tightening around\u00a0it\u00a0 \n  coughing  \n \n These symptoms are often worse at night and early in the morning, particularly if the condition is not well controlled. They may also develop or become worse in response to a certain trigger, such as exercise or exposure to an allergen. \n Read our page on the\u00a0 causes of asthma  for more information about potential triggers. \n Speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. You should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control the symptoms. \n Asthma attacks \n When asthma symptoms get significantly worse, it is known as an asthma attack or \"acute asthma exacerbation\". \n Asthma attacks often develop slowly, sometimes taking a couple of days or more to become serious, although some people with asthma are prone to sudden, unexpected severe attacks. It is important to recognise attacks early and take appropriate action. \n During an asthma attack, the symptoms described above may get worse and \u2013 if you're already on treatment \u2013 your inhaler medication may not work\u00a0as well as it normally does. \n You might be monitoring your asthma using a device called a peak flow meter, and there\u00a0may be a drop in your peak expiratory flow. Read about  diagnosing asthma  for more information. \n Signs of a particularly severe asthma attack can include: \n \n your reliever inhaler (which is usually blue) is not helping symptoms as much as usual, or at all \n wheezing, coughing and chest tightness becoming severe and constant \n being too breathless to eat, speak or sleep \n breathing faster \n a rapid heartbeat \n feeling drowsy, exhausted or dizzy \n your lips or fingers\u00a0turning blue (cyanosis) \n \n Call 999 to seek immediate help if you or someone else has symptoms of a severe asthma attack.", "causes": "It's not clear exactly what causes asthma, although it is likely to be a combination of factors. \n Some of these may be genetic. However, a number of environmental factors are thought to\u00a0play a role in the development of asthma. These include air pollution, chlorine in swimming pools and modern hygiene standards (known as the \"hygiene hypothesis\"). \n There is currently not enough evidence to be certain whether any of these can cause asthma, although a variety of environmental irritants, such as dust, cold air and smoke, may make it worse. \n Who is at risk? \n Although the cause of asthma is unknown, a number of things that can increase your chances of developing the condition have been identified. These include: \n \n a family history of asthma or other related allergic conditions (known as atopic conditions) such as eczema,\u00a0 food allergy  or  hay fever  \n having\u00a0another atopic condition \n having  bronchiolitis  (a common childhood lung infection) as a child \n childhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy\u00a0 \n being born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth \n having a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the womb \n \n Some people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job. \n Asthma triggers \n In people with asthma, the small tubes (bronchi) that carry air in and out of the lungs become inflamed and more sensitive than normal. \n This means that when you come into contact with something that irritates your lungs (a trigger), your airways become narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and there is an increase in the production of sticky mucus (phlegm). \n Asthma symptoms can have a range of triggers, such as: \n \n respiratory tract infections \u2013 particularly infections affecting the upper airways, such as\u00a0 colds  and the  flu  \n allergens \u2013 including pollen, dust mites, animal fur or feathers \n airborne irritants \u2013 including cigarette smoke, chemical fumes and atmospheric pollution \n medicines \u2013 particularly the class of painkillers called  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , which includes  aspirin  and  ibuprofen , and\u00a0 beta-blockers  sometimes given for\u00a0 high blood pressure  or some types of\u00a0 heart disease  \n emotions \u2013 including stress or laughing \n foods containing sulphites \u2013 naturally occurring substances found in some food and drinks, such as concentrated fruit juice, jam, prawns and many processed or pre-cooked meals \n weather conditions \u2013 including\u00a0a sudden change in temperature, cold air, windy days, thunderstorms, poor air quality and hot, humid days \n indoor conditions \u2013 including mould or damp, house dust mites and chemicals in carpets and flooring materials \n exercise \n  food allergies  \u2013 including allergies to nuts or other food items \n \n Once you know your asthma triggers, you\u00a0may be able to\u00a0help control your condition by trying\u00a0to avoid them. \n Want to know more? \n \n Asthma UK:  asthma triggers A-Z  \n \n Occupational asthma \n In some cases, asthma is\u00a0associated with substances\u00a0you may be exposed to\u00a0at work. This is known as \"occupational asthma\". \n Some of the most commonly reported\u00a0causes of occupational asthma include exposure to: \n \n isocyanates (chemicals often found in spray paint) \n flour and grain dust \n colophony (a substance\u00a0often found in solder fumes) \n latex \n animals \n wood dust \n \n You may be at an increased risk of developing occupational asthma if you are regularly exposed to substances such as these through\u00a0your work. \n Occupations that are commonly associated with the condition include paint sprayers, bakers and pastry makers, nurses, chemical workers, animal handlers, welders, food processing workers and timber workers. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK:\u00a0occupational asthma  \n  Health and Safety Executive: asthma", "treatment": "Reliever inhalers \n Reliever inhalers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually blue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are taken to relieve asthma symptoms quickly. \n The inhaler usually contains a medicine called a short-acting beta2-agonist, which works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. This allows the airways to open wider, making it easier to breathe again. \n Reliever inhalers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways, so they do not make asthma better in the long term \u2013 they are intended only for the relief of symptoms. \n Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol and terbutaline. They are generally safe medicines with few side effects, unless overused. \n However, they should rarely, if ever, be necessary if asthma is well controlled, and anyone needing to use them three or more times a week should have their treatment reviewed. \n Everyone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler, also known simply as a \"reliever\". \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK: relievers  \n \n Preventer inhalers \n Preventer inhalers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0usually brown, red or orange\u00a0\u2013\u00a0work over time to reduce the amount of inflammation and sensitivity of the airways, and reduce the chances of asthma attacks occurring. \n They must be used regularly (typically twice or occasionally once daily) and indefinitely to keep asthma under control. \n You will need to use the preventer inhaler daily for some time before you gain the full benefit. You may still occasionally need the blue reliever inhaler to relieve your\u00a0symptoms, but your treatment should be reviewed\u00a0if you continue to need them often. \n The preventer inhaler usually contains a medicine called an inhaled corticosteroid. Examples of preventer medicines include beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, ciclesonide and mometasone. \n Preventer treatment should be taken regularly if you have anything more than occasional symptoms from your asthma, and certainly if you feel the need to use a reliever inhaler more than twice a week. \n Some inhaled corticosteroids can occasionally cause a mild fungal infection (oral thrush) in the mouth and throat, so make sure you rinse your mouth thoroughly after inhaling a dose. The use of a spacer device also reduces this risk. For more information on side effects, see below. \n Smoking can reduce the effects of preventer inhalers. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK:\u00a0preventer inhalers  \n \n Other treatments and 'add-on' therapy \n Long-acting reliever inhalers \n If your asthma does not respond to initial treatment, the dose of preventer inhaler you take may be increased in agreement with your healthcare team. \n If this does not control your asthma symptoms, you may be given an inhaler containing a medicine called a long-acting reliever (long-acting bronchodilator/long-acting beta2-agonist, or LABA) to take as well. \n These work in the same way as short-acting relievers. Although they take slightly longer to work, their effects can last for up to 12 hours. This means that taking them regularly twice a day provides 24-hour cover. \n Regular use of long-acting relievers can also help reduce the dosage of preventer medication needed to control asthma. Examples of long-acting relievers include formoterol and salmeterol, and recently vilanterol, which may last up to 24 hours. \n However, like short-acting relievers, long-acting relievers do not reduce the inflammation in the airways. If they are taken without a preventer, this may allow the condition to get worse while masking the symptoms, increasing the chance of a sudden and potentially life-threatening severe asthma attack. \n You should therefore always use a long-acting reliever inhaler in combination with a preventer inhaler, and never by itself. \n In view of this, most long-acting relievers are prescribed in a \"combination\" inhaler, which contains both an inhaled steroid (as a preventer) and a long-acting bronchodilator in the one device. \n Examples of combination inhalers include Seretide, Symbicort, Fostair, Flutiform and Relvar. These are usually (but not always) purple, red and white, or maroon. \n Other preventer medicines \n If regular efficient administration of treatment with a preventer and a long-acting reliever still fails to control asthma symptoms, additional medicines may be tried. Two possible alternatives include: \n \n leukotriene receptor antagonists \u2013\u00a0tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways \n theophyllines \u2013\u00a0tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents \n \n Oral steroids \n If your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed regular steroid tablets. This treatment is usually monitored by a respiratory specialist (an asthma specialist). \n Oral steroids are powerful anti-inflammatory preventers, which are generally used in two ways: \n \n to regain control of asthma when it is temporarily upset\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, by a lapse in regular medication or an unexpected chest infection; in these cases, they are typically given for one or two weeks, then stopped \n when long-term control of asthma remains a problem, despite maximal dosages of inhaled and other medications\u00a0\u2013\u00a0in these cases, oral steroids may be given for prolonged periods, or even indefinitely, while maintaining maximum treatment with inhalers as\u00a0this maximises the chance of being able to stop the oral steroids again in the future \n \n Long-term use of oral steroids has serious possible\u00a0side effects, so they are only used once other treatment options have been tried, and after discussing the risks and benefits with your healthcare team. \n See below for more information on the side effects of steroid tablets. \n Omalizumab (Xolair) \n Omalizumab, also known as Xolair, is the first of a new category of medication that binds to one of the proteins involved in the immune response and reduces its level in the blood. This lowers the chance of an immune reaction happening and causing an asthma attack. \n It is licensed for use in adults and children over six years of age with asthma. \n The National Institute for Heath and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that omalizumab can be used in people with allergy-related asthma who\u00a0need continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids. \n Omalizumab is given as an injection every two to four weeks. It should only be prescribed in a specialist centre. If omalizumab does not control asthma symptoms within 16 weeks, the treatment should be stopped. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK:\u00a0other treatments and \"add-on\" therapies  \n  Asthma UK:\u00a0steroid tablets  \n  NICE: omalizumab for severe persistent allergic asthma  \n \n Bronchial thermoplasty \n Bronchial thermoplasty is a relatively new procedure\u00a0that can be used\u00a0in some cases of severe asthma. It works\u00a0by destroying some of the muscles surrounding the airways in the lungs, which can\u00a0reduce their ability to narrow the airways. \n The procedure is carried out either with sedation or under  general anaesthetic . A bronchoscope (a long, flexible tube) containing a probe is inserted into the lungs through the mouth or nose\u00a0so it touches the airways. \n The probe then uses controlled heat to damage the muscles around the airways. Three treatment sessions are usually needed, with at least\u00a0three weeks between each session. \n There is some evidence to show\u00a0this procedure may reduce asthma attacks and improve the quality of life of someone with severe asthma. \n However, the long-term risks and benefits are not yet fully understood. There is a small risk it will trigger an asthma attack, which sometimes requires hospital admission. \n You should discuss this procedure fully with your clinician if the treatment is offered. \n Want to know more? \n \n  NICE:\u00a0bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthma  \n \n Side effects of treatments \n Side effects of relievers and preventers \n Relievers are a safe and effective medicine, and have\u00a0few side effects as long as they are not used too much. The main side effects include a mild shaking of the hands (tremors),\u00a0 headaches  and muscle cramps. These usually only happen with high doses of reliever inhaler and usually only last for a few minutes. \n Preventers are\u00a0very safe at usual doses, although they can cause a range of side effects at high doses, especially with long-term use. \n The main side effect of preventer inhalers is a fungal infection of the mouth or throat  (oral candidiasis) . You may also develop a hoarse voice and  sore throat . \n Using a spacer can help prevent these side effects, as can rinsing your mouth or cleaning your teeth after\u00a0using\u00a0your preventer inhaler. \n Your doctor or nurse will discuss with you the need to balance control of your asthma with the risk of side effects, and how to keep\u00a0side effects to a minimum. \n Side effects of add-on therapy \n Long-acting relievers may cause similar side effects to short-acting relievers. You should be monitored at the beginning of your treatment and reviewed regularly. If you find there is no benefit to using the long-acting reliever, it should be stopped. \n Theophylline tablets have been known to cause side effects in some people, including nausea, vomiting, tremors and noticeable heartbeats (palpitations). These can usually be avoided by adjusting the dose according to periodic measurement of the theophylline concentration in the blood. \n Side effects of leukotriene receptor agonists can include  tummy (abdominal) pain  and headaches. \n Side effects of steroid tablets \n Oral steroids carry a risk if they are taken for more than three months or if they are taken frequently (more than three or four courses of steroids a year). Side effects can include: \n \n  osteoporosis (fragile bones)  \u00a0 \n  high blood pressure (hypertension) \u00a0 \n  diabetes \u00a0 \n increased appetite, leading to weight gain \n cataracts and\u00a0glaucoma (eye disorders)\u00a0\u00a0 \n thinning of the skin \u00a0 \n easy bruising \u00a0 \n muscle weakness \n \n With the exception of increased appetite, which is very commonly experienced by people taking oral steroids, most of these unwanted effects are uncommon. \n However, it is a good idea to keep an eye out for them regularly, especially side effects that are not immediately obvious, such as high blood pressure, thinning of the bones, diabetes and glaucoma. \n You will need regular appointments to check for these. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK:\u00a0side effects of asthma medicines  \n \n Asthma attacks \n A\u00a0personal asthma action plan (see below) will help you recognise the initial symptoms of an asthma attack, know how to respond, and when to seek medical attention. \n In most cases, the following actions will be recommended: \n \n Take one to two puffs of your reliever inhaler (usually blue) immediately. \n Sit down and try to take slow, steady breaths. \n If you do not start to feel better, take two puffs of your reliever inhaler (one puff at a time) every two minutes\u00a0(you can take up to 10 puffs)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this is easier using a spacer, if you have one. \n If you do not feel better after taking your inhaler as above or if you are worried at any time, call 999. \n If an ambulance does not arrive within 10 minutes and you are still feeling unwell, repeat step three. \n \n If your symptoms improve and you do not need to call 999, you still need to see a doctor or asthma nurse within 24 hours. \n If you are admitted to hospital, you will be given a combination of oxygen, reliever and preventer medicines to bring your asthma under control. \n Your personal asthma action plan will need to be reviewed after an asthma attack, so reasons for the attack can be identified and avoided in future. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK: what to do in an asthma attack  \n \n Personal asthma action plan \n As part of your initial assessment, you should be encouraged to draw up a personal asthma action plan with your GP or asthma nurse. \n If you've been admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack, you should be offered an action plan (or the opportunity to review an existing action plan) before you go home. \n The action plan should include information about your asthma medicines, and will help you recognise when your symptoms are getting worse and what steps to take. You should also be given information about what to do if you have an asthma attack. \n Your personal asthma action plan should be reviewed with your GP or asthma nurse at least once a year, or more frequently if your symptoms are severe. \n As part of your asthma plan, you may be given a  peak flow meter . This will give you another way of monitoring your asthma, rather than relying only on symptoms, so you can recognise deterioration earlier and take appropriate steps. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK: personal asthma action plan  \n \n What is good asthma care? \n Your doctor or nurse will tailor your asthma treatment to your symptoms. Sometimes you may need to be on higher levels of medication than at others. \n You should be offered: \n \n care at your GP surgery provided by doctors and nurses trained in asthma management \n full information about your condition and how to control it \n involvement in making decisions about your treatment \n regular checks to ensure your asthma is under control and your treatment is right for you (this should be at least once a year) \n a written personal asthma action plan agreed with your doctor or nurse \n \n It is also important that your GP or pharmacist teaches you how to properly use your inhaler, as this is an important part of good asthma care. \n Occupational asthma \n If it is possible you have asthma associated with your job (occupational asthma), you will be referred to a respiratory specialist to confirm the diagnosis. \n If your employer has an occupational health service, they should also be informed, along with your health and safety officer. \n Your employer has a responsibility to protect you from the causes of occupational asthma. It may\u00a0sometimes be possible to substitute or remove the substance triggering your occupational asthma from your workplace, to redeploy you\u00a0to another role within the company, or to wear protective breathing equipment. \n However, you may need to consider changing your job or relocating away from your work environment, ideally within 12 months of your symptoms developing. \n Some people with occupational asthma may be entitled to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK: occupational asthma  \n  GOV.UK: Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit  \n  Health and Safety Executive: asthma  \n \n Complementary therapies \n A number of complementary therapies have been suggested for the treatment of asthma, including: \n \n breathing exercises \n traditional Chinese herbal medicine \n acupuncture \n ionisers\u00a0\u2013\u00a0devices that use an electric current to charge (ionise) molecules of air \n manual therapies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as chiropractic \n hypnosis \n homoeopathy \n dietary supplements \n \n However, there is little evidence that any of these treatments, other than breathing exercises, are effective. \n There is some evidence that breathing exercises\u00a0can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people. These include\u00a0breathing exercises taught by a physiotherapist, yoga and the Buteyko method (a technique involving slowed, controlled breathing). \n Want to know more? \n \n  Asthma UK: complementary therapies", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "If you have typical asthma symptoms, your GP will often be able to make a diagnosis. \n They\u00a0will want to know when\u00a0the symptoms happen and how often, and if you have noticed anything that might trigger them. \n Your GP may also ask whether\u00a0you have any allergic (atopic) conditions such as\u00a0 eczema  and\u00a0 hay fever , which often occur alongside asthma. \n A number of tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis. These are described below. \n In children, asthma can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions can cause similar symptoms in infants. The tests outlined below are also not always suitable for\u00a0children. \n Your GP therefore may sometimes suggest\u00a0that your child uses\u00a0an asthma inhaler as a trial treatment. If this helps improve your child's symptoms, it is likely\u00a0they have asthma. \n Spirometry \n A breathing test called\u00a0spirometry will often be carried out to assess how well your lungs work. This involves taking a deep breath and exhaling as fast as you can through a mouthpiece attached to a machine called a spirometer. \n The spirometer takes two measurements \u2013 the volume of air you can breathe out in the first second of exhalation (the forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1) and the total amount of air you breathe out (the forced vital capacity or FVC). \n You may be asked to breathe into the spirometer a few times to get an accurate reading. \n The readings are then compared with average measurements for people your age, sex and height, which can show if your airways are obstructed. \n Sometimes an initial set of measurements is taken, and you are\u00a0then given a medicine to open up your airways (a reliever inhaler) to see if this improves your breathing when another reading is taken. \n This is known as reversibility testing, and it can be useful in distinguishing asthma from other lung conditions, such as  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . \n Peak expiratory flow test \n A small hand-held device known as a peak flow meter can be used to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath. This is your peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the test is usually called a peak flow test. \n This test requires a bit of practise to get it right, so your GP or nurse will show you how to do it and may suggest you take the best of two or three readings. \n You may be given a peak flow meter to take home and a diary to record measurements of your peak flow over a period of weeks. This is because asthma is variable and your lung function may change throughout the day. \n Your diary may also have a space to record your symptoms. This helps to diagnose asthma and, once diagnosed, will help you recognise when your asthma is getting worse and aid decisions about what action to take. \n To help diagnose asthma that may be related to your work (occupational asthma), your GP may ask you to take measurements of your peak expiratory flow both at work and when you are away from work. Your GP may then refer you to a specialist to confirm the diagnosis. \n Other tests \n Some people may also need a\u00a0number of more specialised tests. The tests may confirm the diagnosis of asthma or help diagnose a different condition. This will help you and your doctor to plan your treatment. \n Airways responsiveness \n This test is sometimes used to diagnose asthma when the diagnosis is not clear from the more simple tests discussed above. It measures how your airways react when they come into contact with a trigger. \n You will be asked to breathe in a medication that deliberately irritates or constricts your airways slightly if you have asthma, causing a small decrease in your FEV1 measured using spirometry and possibly triggering mild asthma symptoms. If you do not have asthma, your airways will not respond to this stimulus. \n The test often involves inhaling progressively increasing amounts of the medication at intervals, with spirometry measurement of FEV1 in between to see if it falls below a certain threshold. In some cases, however, exercise may be used as a trigger. \n Testing airway inflammation \n It may also be useful in some cases to carry out tests to check for inflammation in your airways. This can be done in two main ways: \n \n a\u00a0mucus sample \u2013 the doctor may take a sample of mucus (phlegm)\u00a0so it can be tested for signs of\u00a0inflammation in the airways \n nitric oxide concentration \u2013 as you breathe out, the level of nitric oxide in your breath is measured using a special machine;\u00a0a high level of nitric oxide can be a sign of airway inflammation \n \n Allergy tests \n Skin testing or a  blood test  can be used to confirm whether your asthma is associated with specific allergies,\u00a0such as\u00a0dust mites, pollen or foods. \n Tests can also be carried out to see if you are allergic or sensitive to certain substances known to cause occupational asthma. \n Read more about  diagnosing allergies  \n Want to know more? \n \n  British Lung Foundation: diagnosing asthma"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Asbestosis", "introduction": "Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. \n Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used in construction. \n Asbestos can\u00a0be very dangerous.\u00a0It does not present a health risk if it is undisturbed, but if material containing asbestos\u00a0is chipped, drilled, broken or allowed to deteriorate,\u00a0it can release a fine dust that contains asbestos fibres. \n When the dust is breathed in, the asbestos fibres enter the lungs and can gradually damage\u00a0them over time. For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary.\u00a0However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure. \n Read more about the  causes of asbestosis . \n Symptoms of asbestosis \n Breathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including: \n \n shortness of breath \u2013 this may only occur after physical\u00a0activity at first, but it\u00a0can eventually become a more constant problem \n a persistent\u00a0 cough  \n wheezing \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n chest pain \n in more advanced cases,\u00a0clubbed (swollen) fingertips \n \n Nowadays, most people who are diagnosed with asbestosis were exposed many years ago, before there were effective controls on exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace. \n See your GP if you have the above symptoms and you think you may have been exposed to asbestos in the past. \n Read more about  diagnosing asbestosis . \n Treating asbestosis \n There is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs. \n One of the\u00a0most important things someone with the condition can do is to\u00a0 stop smoking ,\u00a0if they smoke. This is because\u00a0the symptoms\u00a0are more\u00a0likely to get worse in people who smoke, and\u00a0smoking also increases the risk of  lung cancer \u00a0in people with asbestosis. \n If necessary, treatments such as oxygen therapy\u00a0can improve the quality of life of someone with asbestosis. \n Read more about  treating asbestosis . \n Outlook \n The outlook for asbestosis can vary significantly, depending on the extent of damage to the lungs and whether any other conditions are present. \n Asbestosis can get worse over time and severe cases can place a significant strain on a person's health and shorten their life expectancy,\u00a0but in many cases the condition progresses very slowly or not at all. \n However, people with asbestosis have a higher risk of developing other serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: \n \n pleural disease \u2013 where the membrane covering the lungs (pleura) becomes thicker, which can further contribute to breathlessness and chest discomfort \n  mesothelioma  \u2013 a type of cancer that affects the membrane that covers the lungs, heart and gut \n  lung cancer  \n \n Overall, more people with asbestosis die as a result of one of the cancers mentioned above, or from natural causes, than from asbestosis itself. \n Compensation \n If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis, you may be able to claim compensation. This can be done through: \n \n industrial injuries disablement benefit \u2013 this is\u00a0a weekly benefit that may be paid to people with asbestosis who were exposed to asbestos while in employment (but not self-employed) \n a civil claim for compensation through the courts \u2013\u00a0you will need to obtain legal advice about how to do this \n a claim for a lump compensation sum under the\u00a0Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979 \u2013\u00a0if you have asbestosis, or you are the dependant of someone who has died from the condition, and\u00a0you haven't been able to get compensation through the courts because the employer who exposed you (or the person on whose behalf you are claiming) has ceased trading \n \n Read more about  industrial injuries disablement benefit on the GOV.UK website . \n Preventing asbestosis \n There are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these \u2013 called crocidolite and amosite \u2013 were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999. \n However, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings. \n It's therefore\u00a0important to take precautions to reduce your risk of inhaling asbestos fibres if you live or work in a building that may contain asbestos. \n If you are concerned that your house may contain asbestos,\u00a0you can seek advice from an environmental health officer at your local authority or council. Do not attempt to remove any materials that you think may contain asbestos yourself. \n If your job means\u00a0you could potentially be exposed to asbestos fibres, make sure you are fully aware of what you can do to reduce your risk. Do not\u00a0attempt to remove any asbestos you come across, unless you have been trained in how to do this safely. \n Read about  preventing asbestosis . \n Who is affected \n Asbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years. \n However, in 2011 there were 178 deaths directly caused by asbestosis and 429 where the condition was thought to have played a role. 980 new cases were assessed for industrial injuries disablement benefit during 2012.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Asbestosis is caused by breathing in asbestos fibres. People working in certain trades are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the past. \n What is asbestos? \n Asbestos is a general term\u00a0for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres.\u00a0Materials containing asbestos used to be widely used in construction, because they are strong, durable and fire-resistant. \n There were three main types of asbestos in commercial use: \n \n crocidolite (\"blue asbestos\") \n amosite (\"brown asbestos\") \n chrysotile (\"white asbestos\") \n \n All these types of asbestos are hazardous if a material containing them becomes damaged and the fibres are released into the air. \n No crocidolite was imported into the UK after 1970, and both amosite and crocidolite were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans on the industrial use of both these materials came into force earlier than this). Chrysotile was not banned until 1999. \n This means that, although asbestos is no longer used, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings. \n How asbestos fibres affect the lungs \n When you inhale a foreign body, such as a dust particle, cells in the lungs called macrophages\u00a0usually hunt and break the particle down before it gets into your lung tissues and bloodstream. \n However, asbestos fibres are too difficult for the macrophages to break down. In an attempt to break down the fibres, the macrophages release substances that are intended to destroy the fibres, but actually cause the tiny air sacs in your lungs (alveoli) to become damaged and permanently scarred over time. This scarring is what is known as asbestosis. \n Alveoli are crucial in transferring oxygen from the air into your bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide from your bloodstream. If they become damaged and scarred, these processes will be affected, resulting in symptoms such as breathlessness. \n For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure \u2013 usually over many years \u2013 to relatively high numbers of\u00a0asbestosis fibres is necessary. \n Occupations associated with asbestos exposure \n The use of asbestos increased significantly after World War II. It\u00a0peaked during the 1970s, before declining during the 1980s and 1990s. You may have been exposed to asbestos if you worked in an industry such as building or construction, where asbestos was used during this time period. \n Occupations particularly associated with exposure to asbestos during this period\u00a0include: \n \n insulation workers \n boilermakers \n plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters \n shipyard workers \n sheet metal workers \n plasterers \n chemical technicians\u00a0 \n heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration mechanics \n \n Now that asbestos is\u00a0no longer used,\u00a0those most at risk of being exposed to asbestos fibres include people whose jobs put them at risk of damaging any asbestos remaining in older buildings, such as caretakers,\u00a0electricians and demolition workers. \n The\u00a0 Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website  has more information about when you are most likely to be at risk of asbestos exposure.", "treatment": "There is no cure for asbestosis, as the damage to the lungs is irreversible. However, you can take steps to reduce your symptoms and improve your quality of life. \n These are outlined below. \n Not smoking \n If you have been diagnosed with asbestosis and you smoke, it's very important to stop as soon as possible. \n Smoking can make your symptoms of\u00a0breathlessness worse and significantly increase your risk of developing  lung cancer \u00a0at a later stage. \n Speak to your GP for help with giving up smoking. They can advise about nicotine replacement therapies and prescription medicines that\u00a0can greatly increase your chances of quitting successfully. Your GP can also\u00a0put you in touch with local support groups in your area. \n You can also phone Quit Your Way Scotland\u00a0on 0800 84 84 84 to get more help and advice about quitting smoking. \n Read more about\u00a0 stopping smoking . \n Vaccinations \n If you have asbestosis, your lungs will be more vulnerable to infection. \n It's recommended that you have the\u00a0influenza (flu) vaccination to protect against  flu , and the pneumococcal vaccination to protect you from the bacteria that can cause serious conditions, such as  pneumonia . Your GP\u00a0can arrange for you to have these vaccinations. \n You will need the flu vaccine every year to ensure you stay protected. Most people only require one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine, although additional booster shots may be recommended if your general health is poor. \n Long-term oxygen therapy \n If you have severe asbestosis, your body may not be getting all\u00a0the oxygen it needs to function properly.\u00a0 Oxygen therapy  may be recommended\u00a0if you have low levels of oxygen in your blood. \n Oxygen therapy\u00a0is supplied through a machine called an oxygen concentrator, which purifies oxygen from the air in the room and produces a more oxygen-rich supply of air. \n This oxygen-rich air is breathed in through a mask or a small, soft plastic tube\u00a0placed just inside your nostrils (nasal cannula). \n You may be given a small, portable oxygen tank and mask, to be used when you're out of the house. This is known as ambulatory oxygen. \n It's very important not to smoke when you are using an oxygen concentrator. This is because high concentrations of oxygen\u00a0are highly flammable, and a lit cigarette or flame could cause a fire or an explosion. \n Medication \n Most people with asbestosis will not benefit from any specific medication for the condition, unless you have another condition also affecting the lungs,\u00a0such as  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . \n More severe cases may benefit\u00a0from medicines, such as small doses of\u00a0morphine to reduce breathlessness and a\u00a0 cough . \n Serious side effects are uncommon, because the dose is so small. The most common problem is  constipation ,\u00a0and a  laxative  will usually be given at the same time to help you pass stools.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "When diagnosing asbestosis, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (a medical instrument used to listen to the heart and lungs). \n If your lungs have been affected by asbestos, they will usually make a crackling noise when you breathe in. \n Your GP will also ask about your work history, particularly\u00a0about periods when you may have been exposed to asbestos, how long you may have been exposed, and whether you were issued with any safety equipment, such as a face mask, when you were working. \n Referral to a specialist \n If\u00a0asbestosis is\u00a0suspected,\u00a0you\u00a0will be referred to a specialist in lung diseases for tests to confirm any lung scarring. These may include:\u00a0 \n \n a chest  X-ray  \u2013 to detect abnormalities in the structure of your lungs that could be caused by asbestosis \n a  computerised tomography\u00a0(CT) scan  of the lungs \u2013 which produces more detailed images of\u00a0the lungs and the membrane covering the lungs and can help identify less obvious abnormalities \n lung function tests \u2013 to assess the impact of damage of the lungs, determine how much air your lungs can hold and assess\u00a0how well oxygen crosses the membrane of the lungs into your bloodstream \n \n Before confirming a diagnosis of asbestosis, the chest specialist will also consider and rule out other possible causes of lung inflammation and scarring, such as  rheumatoid arthritis ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Arthritis", "introduction": "Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. \n In the UK, around 10 million people have arthritis. It affects people\u00a0of all ages, including children (see below). \n Types of arthritis \n The two most common types of arthritis are: \n \n  osteoarthritis  \n  rheumatoid arthritis  \n \n Osteoarthritis \n Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK, affecting around 8 million people. \n It most often develops in\u00a0adults who are in their late 40s or older. It's also more common in women and\u00a0people with a family history of\u00a0the condition.\u00a0However, it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other\u00a0joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. \n Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. \n Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs, called osteophytes. \n Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. \n The most commonly affected joints\u00a0are those in the: \n \n hands \n spine \n knees \n hips \n \n Rheumatoid arthritis \n In the UK, rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 400,000 people. It often starts when a person is between 40 and 50 years old. Women are three times more likely to be affected than men. \n Rheumatoid and osteoarthritis are two different conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.\u00a0 \n The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This\u00a0may cause the\u00a0bone and cartilage to break down. \n People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.\u00a0 \n Other types of arthritis and related conditions \n \n  Ankylosing spondylitis  \u2013 a long-term inflammatory\u00a0condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together.\u00a0Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large joints. \n Cervical spondylosis \u2013 also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffness. \n  Fibromyalgia  \u2013 causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendons. \n  Lupus  \u2013 an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissues. \n  Gout  \u2013 a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body. This can be left in joints (usually affecting the big toe) but can develop in any joint. It causes intense pain, redness\u00a0and swelling. \n Psoriatic arthritis \u2013 an inflammatory joint condition that can affect people with\u00a0 psoriasis . \n Enteropathic arthritis \u2013 a form of chronic, inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the two best-known types being ulcerative colitis and  Crohn's disease . About one in\u00a0five people with Crohn's or ulcerative colitis will develop enteropathic arthritis. The most common areas affected by inflammation are\u00a0the peripheral (limb) joints and the spine. \n  Reactive arthritis  \u2013 this can cause inflammation of the joints, eyes and urethra (the tube that urine passes through).\u00a0It develops shortly after an infection of the bowel, genital tract or, less frequently, after a throat infection. \n Secondary arthritis \u2013 a type of arthritis that can develop after a joint injury and sometimes occurs many years afterwards. \n  Polymyalgia rheumatica  \u2013 a condition that almost always affects people over 50 years of age, where the immune system causes muscle pain and\u00a0stiffness, usually across the shoulders and tops of the legs. It can also cause\u00a0joint inflammation. \n \n Symptoms of arthritis \n The\u00a0symptoms of arthritis you experience will vary depending on the type you have. \n This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have: \n \n joint pain, tenderness and stiffness \n inflammation in and around the joints \n restricted movement of the\u00a0joints \n warm, red skin over the affected joint \n weakness and\u00a0muscle wasting \n \n Arthritis and children \n Arthritis is often associated with older people, but\u00a0it can also\u00a0affect children. In the UK, about 15,000 children and young people are affected by arthritis. \n Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and\u00a0inflammation in one or more joints for at least six weeks. \n Although the exact cause of JIA is\u00a0unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life. \n The main types of JIA are discussed below. Arthritis Research UK has more information about the different  types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis . \n Oligo-articular JIA \n Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects fewer than five joints in the body\u00a0\u2013\u00a0most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists. \n Oligo-articular JIA has good recovery rates and long-term effects are rare. However, there's a risk that children\u00a0with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular\u00a0eye\u00a0tests with an ophthalmologist (eye care specialist) are recommended. \n Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis) \n Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, affects five or more joints. It can develop at any age during childhood. \n The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the  symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis . The condition is often accompanied by a rash and a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. \n Systemic onset JIA \n Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, lethargy (a lack of energy) and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can\u00a0become swollen and inflamed. \n Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age. \n Enthesitis-related arthritis \n Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that affects older boys or teenagers. It can cause pain in the soles of the feet and around the knee and hip joints, where the ligaments attach to the bone. \n Treating arthritis \n There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition. \n For osteoarthritis, medications are often prescribed, including: \n \n painkillers \n  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  \n  corticosteroids  \n \n In severe cases, the following surgical procedures may be recommended: \n \n arthroplasty (joint replacement) \n arthodesis (joint fusion) \n osteotomy (where a\u00a0bone is cut and re-aligned) \n \n Read more\u00a0about\u00a0 how osteoarthritis is treated . \n Treatment for\u00a0rheumatoid arthritis aims\u00a0to slow down the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation or swelling. This is\u00a0to try and prevent damage to the joints. Recommended treatments include: \n \n analgesics (painkillers) \n disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a combination of treatments is often recommended \n physiotherapy\u00a0 \n  regular exercise \u00a0 \n \n Read more\u00a0about\u00a0 how rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0is treated . \n Further information and support \n Read more information about: \n \n  living with arthritis  \n  arthritis \u00a0on\u00a0 Arthritis Research UK \u00a0 \n  managing arthritis \u00a0on\u00a0 Arthritis Care", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Anorexia nervosa", "introduction": "Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder and a serious mental health condition. \n People with anorexia have problems with eating. They are very anxious about their weight and keep it as low as possible by strictly controlling and limiting what they eat. Many people with anorexia will also exercise excessively to lose weight. \n It is thought that people with anorexia are so concerned about their weight because they: \n \n think they are fat or overweight \n have a strong fear of being fat \n want to be thin \n \n Even when a person with anorexia becomes extremely underweight, they still feel compelled to lose more weight. \n Though people with anorexia avoid eating food whenever they can, they also develop an obsession with eating and diet. For example, they may obsessively count the calories in different types of foods even though they have no intention of eating it. \n Some people with anorexia will also binge eat, i.e. they eat a lot of food in a short space of time. They then try to get rid of the food from their body by vomiting or using laxatives (medication that causes the bowels to empty; normally used for the treatment of constipation.) \n The symptoms of anorexia usually begin gradually, such as adopting a restrictive diet. They then often spiral out of control quickly. \n How common is anorexia? \n Despite being an uncommon condition, anorexia is the leading cause of mental health-related deaths. \n Most cases of anorexia develop in girls and women. One in every 200 women is affected. Symptoms of anorexia usually first develop during the teenage years, at the average age of 15 (see  Anorexia \u2013 symptoms  for more information). But the condition can develop at any time, including childhood. \n Anorexia also affects 1 in every 2,000 men. Some experts are concerned that the number of men with the condition may be increasing. \n The cause of anorexia is unknown, but most experts believe the condition results from a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors (see  Anorexia \u2013 causes  for more information). \n The long-term malnutrition associated with anorexia can cause a range of serious complications, such as: \n \n osteoporosis (weakening of the bones) \n kidney disease \n heart failure \n \n Outlook \n One of the biggest challenges in treating anorexia is that it is a condition characterised by self-denial. Many people with anorexia refuse to admit, or are unable to grasp, that there is anything wrong with them or their behaviour. \n If the person is persuaded to seek help, it usually takes five to six years of treatment before they make a complete recovery, and relapses are common. \n Treatment for anorexia usually involves talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which aim to change the person\u2019s attitudes and behaviour. Nutritional support is also offered to help them gain weight safely. \n Around 20-30% of people with anorexia do not respond to treatment, and around 5% will die from complications caused by malnutrition.", "symptoms": "The main symptom of anorexia is losing a lot of weight deliberately. For example, by: \n \n eating as little as possible \n making yourself vomit \n doing too much exercise \n \n A person with anorexia will want their weight to be as low as possible \u2013 much less than the average for their age and height. They are so afraid of gaining weight that they cannot eat normally. \n After they have eaten, they may try to get rid of food from their body by making themselves sick regularly. Signs of regular vomiting could include: \n \n leaving the table immediately after meals \n dental problems such as  tooth decay  or bad breath, caused by the acid in vomit damaging their teeth and mouth \n hard skin on their knuckles, caused by putting their fingers down their throat \n \n The need to obsessively burn calories usually draws people with anorexia to \u2018high-impact\u2019 activities, such as running, dancing or aerobics. Some people will use any available opportunity to burn calories, such as preferring to stand rather than sit. \n They may try to make food pass through their body as quickly as possible. For example, by either taking: \n \n laxatives (medication that helps to empty the bowel) \n diuretics (medication that helps remove fluid from the body) \n \n In reality, laxatives and diuretics have little effect on the calories absorbed from food. \n Eating and food \n Although anorexia means \u2018loss of appetite\u2019, people with anorexia nervosa do not usually lose their appetite; they like food and feel hungry. \n However, they do not think about food in the same way as other people. This can show itself in various ways. For example, they may: \n \n tell lies about eating or what they have eaten \n give excuses about why they are not eating \n pretend they have eaten earlier \n tell lies about how much weight they have lost \n find it difficult to think about anything other than food \n spend lots of time reading cookery books and recipes \n \n Someone with anorexia nervosa strictly controls what they eat. For example, by: \n \n strict dieting \n counting the calories in food excessively \n avoiding food they think is fattening \n eating only low-calorie food \n missing meals (fasting) \n avoiding eating with other people \n hiding food \n cutting food into tiny pieces \u2013 to make it less obvious that they have eaten very little, and to make the food easier to swallow \n taking appetite suppressants, such as slimming pills or diet pills \n \n They may also drink lots of fluids that contain caffeine, such as coffee, tea and low-calorie fizzy drinks, as these can provide a low-calorie, short-term burst of energy. \n Some people with anorexia also begin to use illegal stimulant drugs known to cause weight loss, such as cocaine or amphetamines. \n Self-esteem, body image and feelings \n People with anorexia often believe that their value as a person is related to their weight and how they look. They think other people will like them more if they are thinner, seeing their weight loss in a positive way. \n They often have a distorted view of what they look like (their body image). For example, they think they look fat when they are not. They may try to hide how thin they are by wearing loose or baggy clothes. \n Many people will also practise a type of behaviour known as \u2018body-checking\u2019, which involves persistently and repeatedly: \n \n weighing themselves \n measuring themselves, such as their waist size \n checking their body in the mirror \n \n Anorexic people usually have low self-esteem or self-confidence. They may withdraw from relationships and become distant from members of their family and friends. \n Anorexia can also affect the person\u2019s school work or how well they perform their job. \n They may find it difficult to concentrate, and they might lose interest in their usual activities. They may have few interests, even though they seem busier than usual. \n Other signs of anorexia \n Eating too little for a long time can result in physical symptoms, such as: \n \n fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on their body \n more hair on their face \n their pubic hair becoming sparse and thin \n \n Their heartbeat may be slow or irregular, which can lead to poor circulation. They may also: \n \n have pain in their abdomen (tummy) \n feel bloated or  constipated  \n have swelling in their feet, hands or face (known as oedema) \n feel very tired (fatigue), as their sleep patterns may have changed \n have low blood pressure (hypotension) \n feel cold or have a low body temperature (hypothermia) \n feel light-headed or dizzy \n \n In children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. They may gain less weight than expected (if any) and may be smaller than other people of the same age. \n Women and older girls with anorexia may stop having their periods (known as amenorrhoea or absent periods). Anorexia can also lead to infertility.", "causes": "The exact causes of anorexia nervosa are unclear, but most specialists believe it's likely to be the result of a combination of factors. \n Psychological factors \n Many people who develop anorexia share certain personality and behavioural traits that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include: \n \n a tendency towards\u00a0depression and anxiety \n finding it difficult to handle\u00a0stress \n excessive worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future \n perfectionism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0setting strict, demanding goals or standards \n being very emotionally restrained \n having feelings of obsession and compulsion, but not necessarily  obsessive compulsive disorder \u00a0\u2013 unwanted thoughts, images or urges\u00a0that compel them\u00a0to perform certain acts \n \n It's also been suggested some people with anorexia have an overwhelming fear ( phobia ) of being fat. \n Environmental factors \n Puberty\u00a0seems to be an important environmental factor contributing to anorexia. It may be the combination of hormonal changes and feelings of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem\u00a0during puberty that triggers anorexia. \n Western culture and society may also play a part. Girls\u00a0\u2013 and, to a lesser extent, boys\u00a0\u2013\u00a0are exposed to a wide range of media messages that constantly reinforce the\u00a0idea that being thin is beautiful. \n Magazines and newspapers also\u00a0focus on celebrities' minor physical imperfections, such as gaining a few pounds or having cellulite. \n Other environmental factors that may contribute towards anorexia include: \n \n pressures and stress at school, such as exams or bullying, particularly teasing about body weight or shape \n occupations or hobbies where being thin is seen as the ideal, such as dancing or athletics \n a stressful life event, such as losing a job, the breakdown of a relationship, or  bereavement \u00a0 \n difficult family relationships \n physical or sexual abuse\u00a0 \n \n Anorexia often starts off as a form of dieting that gradually gets out of control. \n Biological and genetic\u00a0factors \n It's been suggested changes in brain function\u00a0or hormone levels may also have a role in anorexia, although it's not clear if these lead to anorexia or\u00a0if they develop later as a result of  malnutrition . \n These changes may affect the part of the brain\u00a0that controls appetite, or may lead to feelings of anxiety and guilt when eating that improve when meals are missed or after excessive\u00a0exercise. \n The risk of someone developing anorexia is also thought to be greater in people with a family history of\u00a0eating disorders, depression, or substance misuse, which suggests genes could play a role.", "treatment": "Before your treatment begins, you will probably have an overall assessment of your health. This may be done by your GP or another healthcare professional, such as one that specialises in eating disorders. \n The assessment will help your healthcare professional draw up a plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess: \n \n your health and medical needs \n your social needs, such as support from family and friends \n any risks that affect you, such as whether you are at risk of harming yourself \n how mild or severe your condition is, in case any urgent action is needed \n \n Your care team \n If you are diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, your GP will probably be involved in your ongoing treatment and care. Other healthcare professionals may also be involved in your treatment, such as: \n \n a specialist\u00a0counsellor \n a psychiatrist (doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions) \n a  psychologist  \n a nurse \n a dietician (specialist in nutrition) \n \n If a child or teenager has anorexia, a paediatrician (doctor who specialises in children) may also be involved in their treatment. \n Your treatment plan \n Where you are treated may depend on how mild or severe your condition is. For example, you may be treated: \n \n as an outpatient (this is most common) \n as a day patient or in a day unit \n as in inpatient in hospital, if your weight loss or symptoms are severe \n \n In some areas, eating disorders such as anorexia are treated by community mental health teams, which are made up of different health and social care professionals. \n In other areas, there are units that specialise in treating eating disorders. Some services that treat eating disorders also specialise in treating young people. \n Treating anorexia \n It is important to start treatment as early as possible, especially if someone has already lost a lot of weight. \n Treatment for anorexia usually includes: \n \n psychological treatment \u2013 talking to a therapist or counsellor \n advice on eating and nutrition to help you gain weight safely \n \n These treatments work better when combined, rather than on their own. \n Your physical health will be monitored closely during your treatment. For example: \n \n your weight will be checked regularly \n you may have regular health checks with your GP or another healthcare professional \n \n In children and young people with anorexia, their growth, development and weight will be monitored closely. Their height will also be checked regularly against the average for their age and sex. \n Other health problems caused by your anorexia will also be treated. For example, if you: \n \n vomit regularly, you will be encouraged to stop. You will be given advice on dental hygiene to help prevent stomach acid damaging the enamel on your teeth. You will also be advised to visit a dentist regularly \n take laxatives or diuretics, you will be advised to reduce them gradually so that your body can adjust. Stopping them suddenly can cause problems, such as nausea and constipation \n \n Gaining weight safely \n Your healthcare professional will give you advice on how to increase the amount you eat so you can gain weight safely. \n They will probably ask about your current eating habits and how much fluid you drink, as well as lifestyle issues, such as smoking and alcohol. This will determine what advice they give you, and help them to identify any deficiencies in your diet, such as a lack of vitamins. \n Your healthcare professional will help you to develop healthy eating habits, such as: \n \n eating more food \n eating more healthily \n increasing the nutrients and calories you get from food \n \n You may need to start by eating small amounts of food, then gradually increase what you eat. Your body will not be used to dealing with normal amounts. \n You may need to take supplements, such as multivitamins or multiminerals, to adjust the chemical balance in your body. Some experts think that this should be done before you start gaining weight. \n Work towards having a regular pattern of eating, with three meals a day. A target weight may be set, so you can aim for a minimum healthy weight. \n If you are treated as an outpatient, aim to gain an average of 0.5kg a week. Most people can achieve this by eating around 3,500 to 7,000 extra calories each week. This level of weight gain helps to avoid complications that can occur if you gain weight more quickly, such as a chemical imbalance in your body. \n If your weight loss is severe, treatment in hospital may be needed to help you start to gain weight. This is sometimes called \u2018refeeding\u2019. Your health will be closely monitored, particularly in the first few days. People treated as inpatients should aim to gain an average of around 0.5\u20131.0kg (1-2lbs) a week. \n Types of psychological treatment \n Various types of psychological treatment can be used to treat anorexia, such as: \n \n cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) \n cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n interpersonal therapy (IPT) \n focal psychodynamic therapy (FPT) \n family therapy \n \n These different types of psychological treatments are discussed below. \n Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) \n CAT is based on the theory that serious mental health conditions such as anorexia are caused by unhealthy patterns of behaviour and thinking, which a person has developed in their past, usually in their childhood. \n CAT involves a three-stage process that you will work through with your therapist: \n \n reformulation \u2013 you look for events in your past that may explain why the unhealthy patterns developed. For example, you may have felt in control by not eating during a time in your life that was particularly chaotic or stressful \n recognition \u2013 you admit and recognise how these patterns are contributing towards your anorexia \n revision \u2013 after discussion with your therapist, you identify changes you can make to break these unhealthy patterns \n \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n CBT is based on the theory that how we think about a situation affects how we act. In turn, our actions can affect how we think and feel. It is therefore necessary to change the act of thinking (cognition) and our behaviour at the same time. \n The therapist will show you how the symptoms of anorexia are often associated with unhealthy and unrealistic thoughts and beliefs regarding food and diet. For example, thinking that: \n \n \u2018putting on weight is the single worst thing that can happen in my life\u2019 \n \u2018everyone I know secretly thinks I am fat\u2019 \n \u2018if I finish the whole meal then the people I am eating with will think I am greedy and worthless\u2019 \n \n The therapist will encourage you to adopt healthier, more realistic ways of thinking that should lead to more positive behaviour. \n Interpersonal therapy (IPT) \n IPT is based on the theory that our relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a powerful effect on our mental health. \n Anorexia may be associated with feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety and self-doubt that are caused by problems with interacting with people. \n During IPT, the therapist will explore any negative issues associated with your interpersonal relationships and how these issues can be resolved. \n Focal psychodynamic therapy (FPT) \n FPT is based on the theory that mental health conditions may be associated with unresolved conflicts that occurred in the past, usually in childhood, that are being re-acted in adult life. \n FPT encourages you to think about how early childhood experiences may have affected you. You may then be able to find more successful ways of coping with stressful situations and negative thoughts and emotions. \n Family therapy \n Anorexia does not just impact on one individual; it can have a big impact on the person\u2019s family. \n Family therapy involves the person with anorexia and close members of their family discussing how anorexia has affected the family, and the positive changes the person and their family can make. \n Choosing a psychological treatment \n With the exception of family therapy, there is little scientific evidence to show that the treatments listed above are effective in treating anorexia. \n This is not to say they are ineffective; just that very little research has been done to investigate their effectiveness in anorexia. \n Little research has been done in this area because many people with anorexia are in denial about their condition, so are unlikely to take part in medical trials. Also, many medical trials that were done had to be abandoned because many of the participants dropped out. \n The type of treatment you choose may be based on personal preference and what services are available in your local area. Some people find using a combination of different treatments useful, such as family therapy and CBT. \n Medication \n Research studies have shown that medication alone is not usually effective in reducing anorexia symptoms. \n Medication is usually only recommended to treat any associated symptoms, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression. \n Any medication that is prescribed for you, such as antidepressants, will be recommended in combination with one of the psychological or nutritional treatments described above. \n Research has found that a medication called olanzapine may be useful in treating anorexia in people who do not respond to other treatments. Olanzapine was originally designed to treat psychosis (where you are unable to distinguish between reality and imagination), and some researchers have argued that it may also be helpful in reducing a person\u2019s anxiety around issues such as weight and diet. \n Side effects of olanzapine include: \n \n sleepiness \n dizziness \n muscle stiffness or spasms \n  constipation  \n  dry mouth  \n rash \n \n Compulsory treatment \n Occasionally, someone with anorexia may refuse treatment even though they are severely ill and their life is at risk. \n In such a situation, doctors may decide to admit the person to hospital for compulsory treatment under the Mental Health Act. This is sometimes called \u2018sectioning\u2019 or being \u2018sectioned\u2019.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits. For example, they may ask: \n \n if you have lost a lot of weight recently or quite quickly \n how you feel about your weight, and if you are concerned about it \n if you think you are overweight even though other people think you are thin \n if you make yourself vomit regularly \n (in women and girls) whether your periods have stopped, and if so, for how long \n \n It is important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP is not trying to judge you or \u2018catch you out\u2019. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are. \n Weight and BMI \n Your GP may check your weight. If someone has anorexia nervosa, their weight is generally at least 15% below average for their age, sex and height. \n Your GP may also calculate your body mass index (BMI). A normal BMI for adults is 20-25. People with anorexia generally have a BMI below 17.5. \n Find out  how to calculate your BMI  \n Blood tests and other tests \n Your GP may not need to carry out any tests to diagnose anorexia nervosa, but they will probably check your pulse and blood pressure. \n If you have anorexia, you have a higher risk of developing some heart conditions, such as irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). Sometimes an ECG (electrocardiogram) may be needed to check how well your heart is working. \n Your GP may do blood tests to check the level of: \n \n fluids in your blood \n chemicals or minerals, such as potassium in your blood (see Anorexia \u2013 complications for more information). \n \n However, blood tests can sometimes give normal results in an anorexic person who is very thin and has a very low body weight. \n Referral to a specialist \n If your GP thinks you may have anorexia, they may refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment \u2013 see  anorexia treatment  for more information. Your GP sometimes carries out this assessment."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Appendicitis", "introduction": "Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5-10cm (2-4 inches) long. It's connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed. \n Nobody knows exactly why we have an appendix, but removing it isn't harmful. \n Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. \n Within hours, the pain travels to the lower right-hand side, where the appendix usually lies, and becomes constant and severe. \n Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. You may lose your appetite, feel sick, and occasionally experience  diarrhoea . \n Read more about the  symptoms of appendicitis . \n When to get medical help \n If you're experiencing abdominal pain that's gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local\u00a0out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren't available, call  NHS 24 111 Service  for advice. \n You should call 999 for an ambulance if you have sudden pain that continues to get worse and spreads across your abdomen. \n These are signs your appendix may have burst, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications. \n Read more about:\u00a0 \n  diagnosing appendicitis \u00a0 \n  complications of appendicitis  \n How appendicitis is treated \n In most cases of appendicitis, the appendix needs to be surgically removed as soon as possible. \n Removal of the appendix, known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy, is one of the most common operations in the UK and its success rate is excellent. \n The operation is most commonly performed as keyhole surgery (laparoscopy), which involves making several small cuts in your abdomen, through which special surgical instruments are inserted. \n Open surgery, where a larger, single cut is made in the abdomen, is usually carried out if the appendix has burst or access is more difficult. \n Most people make a full recovery from an appendectomy in a couple of weeks, although strenuous activities may need to be avoided for up to 6\u00a0weeks after open surgery.\u00a0 \n Read more\u00a0about  treating appendicitis . \n What causes appendicitis? \n It's not exactly clear what the causes of appendicitis are. Most cases are thought to occur when something\u00a0blocks the entrance of the appendix. \n For example, a blockage may be formed by a small piece of\u00a0faeces or an upper\u00a0respiratory tract infection\u00a0could lead to\u00a0a swollen lymph node within the wall of the bowel. \n This obstruction leads to the development of inflammation and swelling. The pressure caused by the swelling can then lead to the appendix bursting. \n As the causes aren't fully understood, there's no guaranteed way of preventing appendicitis. \n Who's affected? \n Appendicitis is a common condition. Around 40,000 people are admitted to hospital with appendicitis each year in England. \n It's estimated around\u00a01 in every 13 people develop it at some point in their life. \n Appendicitis can develop at any age, but it's most common in young people aged from 10 to 20 years old.", "symptoms": "Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go. \n Within hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe. \n Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse. \n If you have appendicitis, you may also have other symptoms, including: \n \n feeling sick (nausea) \n being sick \n loss of appetite \n  diarrhoea  \n a high temperature (fever) and a flushed face \n \n When to get medical help \n If you're experiencing\u00a0abdominal pain that's gradually getting worse, contact your GP or  local\u00a0out-of-hours service  immediately. If these options aren't available, call  NHS 24 111 Service  for advice. \n Appendicitis can easily be confused with something else, such as: \n \n  gastroenteritis  \n severe\u00a0 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  \n  constipation  \n bladder or\u00a0 urine infections  \n  Crohn's disease  \n pelvic infection \n \n In young women, these symptoms can sometimes have a gynaecological cause, such as an  ectopic pregnancy  or menstrual pain. \n However, any condition that causes constant stomach pain requires urgent medical attention. \n You should call 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen.

This operation is known as an appendectomy or appendicectomy. \n Surgery is usually\u00a0also recommended if there's a chance you have appendicitis but it's not been possible to make a clear diagnosis. \n This is because it's considered safer to remove the appendix than run the risk of the appendix bursting. \n In humans, the appendix doesn't perform any important function and having it removed doesn't cause any long-term problems. \n The procedure \n Appendectomies are carried out under\u00a0 general anaesthetic  using either a keyhole or open technique. \n Keyhole surgery \n Keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) is usually the preferred method of removing the appendix because the recovery tends to be quicker than with open surgery. \n This operation involves making 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small cuts (incisions) in your tummy (abdomen). Special instruments are then inserted, including: \n \n a tube that gas is pumped through\u00a0to inflate your abdomen \u2013 this allows the surgeon to see your appendix more clearly and gives them more room to work \n a laparoscope\u00a0\u2013 a small tube containing a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen to a television monitor \n small surgical tools used to remove the appendix \n \n Once the appendix has been removed, the incisions will usually be closed with dissolvable\u00a0stitches.\u00a0Regular stitches\u00a0may also be used, which need to be removed at your GP surgery 7 to 10 days later. \n Open surgery \n In some circumstances, keyhole surgery isn't recommended and open surgery is performed instead. These include: \n \n when the appendix has already burst and formed a lump called an appendix mass \n when the surgeon isn't very experienced in laparoscopic removal \n people who have previously had open abdominal surgery \n \n In these cases, the operation involves making a single larger cut in the lower right-hand side of your abdomen to remove the appendix. \n When there's widespread peritonitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0infection of the inner lining of the abdomen\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it's sometimes necessary to operate through a long cut along the middle of the abdomen in a procedure called a laparotomy. \n As with keyhole surgery, the incision\u00a0is closed using either dissolvable stitches or regular stitches\u00a0that need to be removed at a later date.\u00a0 \n After both types of surgery, the removed appendix is routinely sent to a laboratory to check there are no signs of cancer. This is a precautionary measure, although it's rare for a serious problem to be found. \n Recovery \n One of the main advantages of keyhole surgery is the recovery time tends to be short and most people can leave hospital a few days after the operation. \n If the appendix is operated upon promptly, most patients can go home within 24 hours. With open or complicated surgery\u00a0\u2013 for example, if you have peritonitis\u00a0\u2013 it may\u00a0take up to\u00a0a week before you're well enough to go home. \n For the first few days after the operation you're likely to experience some pain and bruising. This improves over time, but you can take painkillers if necessary. \n If you had keyhole surgery, you may experience pain in the tip of your shoulder for about a week. This is caused by the gas that was pumped into the abdomen during the operation. \n You may also experience some short-term  constipation . You can help reduce this by not taking codeine painkillers, eating plenty of fibre, and\u00a0staying well hydrated. Your GP can prescribe medication if the problem is particularly troublesome. \n Before leaving hospital, you'll be advised about caring for your wound and what activities you should avoid. \n In most cases, you can return to normal activities in a couple of weeks, although more strenuous activities may need to be avoided for 4\u00a0to 6\u00a0weeks after open surgery. \n When to seek medical advice \n While you recover, it's important to keep an eye out for signs of any problems. \n Contact the hospital unit where the appendectomy was performed or your GP for advice if you notice: \n \n increasing pain and swelling \n you start vomiting repeatedly \n a high temperature (fever) \n any discharge coming from the wound \n the wound is hot to touch \n \n These symptoms could be a sign of infection. \n Risks \n Appendectomies are one of the most commonly performed operations in the UK, and serious or long-term complications are rare. \n However, like all types of surgery, there are some risks. These include: \n \n antibiotics may be given before, during, or after the operation to minimise the risk of serious infections \n bleeding under the skin that causes a firm swelling (haematoma) \u2013 this usually gets better on its own, but you should see your GP if you're concerned \n scarring \u2013 both surgical techniques will leave some scarring where the incisions were made \n a collection of pus (abscess) \u2013 in rare cases, an infection caused by the appendix bursting can lead to an abscess after surgery \n hernia \u2013 at the site of the open incision or any of the incisions used in the laparoscopic approach \n \n The use of general anaesthetic also carries some risks, such as the risk of an allergic reaction or inhaling stomach contents, leading to  pneumonia . However, serious complications like this are very rare. \n Alternatives to emergency surgery \n In some cases, appendicitis can lead to the development of a lump on the appendix called an appendix mass. \n This lump, consisting of appendix and fatty tissue, is an attempt by the body to deal with the problem and heal itself. \n If an appendix mass is found during an examination, your doctors may decide it's not necessary to operate immediately. \n Instead, you'll be given a course of antibiotics and an appointment will be made for an appendectomy a few weeks later, when the mass has settled. \n Another possible alternative to immediate surgery is the use of antibiotics to treat appendicitis. \n However, studies have looked into whether antibiotics could be an alternative to surgery and as yet there isn't enough clear evidence to suggest this is the case.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Appendicitis can be tricky to diagnose unless you have the typical symptoms, which are only present in about half of all cases. \n Also, some people's appendixes may be located in a slightly different part of their body, such as: \n \n the pelvis \n behind the large intestine \n around the small bowel \n near the right lower part of the liver \n \n Some people develop pain similar to appendicitis, but it's caused by something else, such as: \n \n  gastroenteritis  \n severe\u00a0 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)  \n  constipation  \n a bladder or\u00a0 urine infection  \n \n Your GP will ask about your symptoms, examine your abdomen, and see if the pain gets worse when pressure is applied to the appendix area (your lower right-hand side). \n If your symptoms are typical of appendicitis, this is normally enough for your GP to make a confident diagnosis. In\u00a0this case, you'll immediately be referred to hospital for treatment. \n Further tests \n If your symptoms aren't typical, further tests may be required in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. \n Further tests may involve:\u00a0 \n \n a\u00a0 blood test  to look for signs of infection \n a\u00a0 pregnancy test  for women \n a urine test to rule out other conditions, such as a bladder infection \n an  ultrasound scan \u00a0to see if the appendix is swollen \n a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan  \n \n It can sometimes take\u00a0time to get test results. Your surgeon may recommend a laparoscopy to inspect your appendix and pelvic organs if the diagnosis is still uncertain. \n You'll usually\u00a0be advised to have your appendix removed if appendicitis is suspected, rather than run the risk of it bursting. This means some people will have their appendix removed even though it's eventually found to be normal. \n In some cases where a diagnosis is not certain, a doctor may recommend waiting up to 24 hours to see if your symptoms improve, stay the same, or get worse. \n If your doctor suspects your appendix has burst, you'll be sent to hospital immediately for treatment. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating appendicitis ."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Anxiety disorders in children", "introduction": "It\u2019s normal for children to feel worried or anxious from time to time, such as when they\u2019re starting school or nursery, or moving to a new area. \n Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear \u2013 it's an understandable reaction in children to change or a stressful event. \n But for some children,\u00a0anxiety affects their behaviour and thoughts on a daily basis, interfering with their school, home and social life. This is when you may need professional help to tackle it before it becomes a more serious issue. \n So how do you know when your child's anxiety has reached this stage? \n \u00a0 \n What are the signs of anxiety in children? \n Anxiety can make a child feel\u00a0scared, panicky, embarrassed or ashamed. \n Some of the signs to look out for in your child are: \n \n finding it hard to concentrate \n not sleeping, or waking in the night with bad dreams \n not eating properly \n quickly getting angry or irritable, and being out of control during outbursts \n constantly worrying or having negative thoughts \n feeling tense and fidgety, or using the toilet often \n always crying \n being clingy all the time (when other children are ok) \n complaining of tummy aches and feeling unwell \n \n Your child may not be old enough to recognise why they're feeling this way. \n The\u00a0reason for the anxiety (if there is one) will differ depending on the age of the child. Separation anxiety\u00a0is common in younger children, whereas older children and teenagers tend to worry more\u00a0about school performance,\u00a0relationships or health. \n What types of anxiety do children and teenagers experience? \n Common types of anxiety in children and teenagers are described below. \n A fear or phobia about something specific \n Children are commonly afraid of things like monsters, dogs or water. This is a perfectly normal part of growing up, but has the\u00a0potential to become a phobia\u00a0(a type of anxiety disorder) when the fear becomes overwhelming and\u00a0affects your child's day-to-day life. \n Read about  phobias  \n Feeling anxious for most of the time for no apparent reason \n While\u00a0it's normal for children to frequently have fears and\u00a0worries, some anxious children may grow up to develop a long-term condition called generalised anxiety disorder when they become a teenager or young adult. \n Generalised anxiety disorder causes you to\u00a0feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event. \n People\u00a0affected by it\u00a0feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed. \n Separation anxiety \n Separation anxiety means a child worrying about not being with their parent or regular carer. \n It is common in young children, and normally develops at about six months of age. It can make settling into\u00a0nursery or school or with a child minder very difficult. \n Separation anxiety in older children may be a sign that they\u2019re feeling insecure about something \u2013 they could be reacting to changes at home, for example. \n Social anxiety \n Social anxiety is not wanting to go out in public, see friends or\u00a0take part in activities. \n Social 'shyness' is perfectly normal for some children and teenagers, but it becomes a problem \u2013 'social anxiety disorder' \u2013 when everyday activities like shopping\u00a0or speaking on the phone cause intense, overwhelming fear. Children affected by it\u00a0tend to fear doing or saying something they think will be humiliating. \n Social anxiety disorder tends to affect older children who have gone through puberty. \n School-based anxiety \n Some children become anxious about going to school, schoolwork, friendships or bullying,\u00a0especially if they're changing school or moving up a level. \n They may not always share these worries with you, and\u00a0instead complain of tummy aches or feeling sick. One of the signs is crying or seeming tired in the morning.\u00a0 \n This may be a problem that needs tackling if it is significantly affecting their daily life (see below). \n Less common anxiety disorders \n  Post-traumatic stress disorder  and  obsessive compulsive disorder  are other anxiety disorders that can occasionally affect children, but are usually seen in adults. \n When is anxiety a disorder that needs treating? \n It is probably time to get professional help for your child's anxiety if: \n \n you feel it is not getting better or is getting worse, and efforts to tackle it yourself have not worked \n you think it's slowing down their development or having a significant effect on their schooling or relationships\u00a0 \n it happens very frequently \n \n How serious can it be? \n Long-term anxiety can\u00a0severely interfere with a child's personal development, family life and\u00a0schooling. \n Anxiety disorders that start in childhood often persist into the teenage years and early adulthood. Teenagers with an anxiety disorder are more likely to develop  clinical depression , misuse drugs and feel suicidal. \n This is why\u00a0you should\u00a0get help as soon as you realise it's a problem. \n Where should I go for help? \n You can talk to your GP on your own or with your child, or your child might be able to have an appointment without you. The doctor should listen to your concerns and offer some advice about what to do next. \n Your child may be referred to the local\u00a0child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS), where the workers are trained to help young people with a wide range of problems. Professionals who work in CAMHS services include psychologists, psychiatrists and psychotherapists. They should offer help and support to parents and carers as well as the child. \n More about\u00a0 CAMHS \u00a0from Young Minds \n Youth counselling services\u00a0 \n If your child doesn't want to see a doctor, they may be able to get help from a local youth counselling service. \n Youth counselling services are specially set up for young people to talk about what\u2019s worrying them, and get advice. \n For more information, visit  Youth Access , the largest provider of young people's advice and counselling services in the UK. \n Telephone or online help \n Telephone helplines or online services can be helpful for children and young people, who may feel it's easier to talk to someone who doesn\u2019t know them.\u00a0 \n How can an anxiety disorder be treated? \n The type of treatment offered will depend on what is causing your child's anxiety. \n Counselling \n It can be helpful for your child to talk in confidence\u00a0about what is worrying them to a trained person, especially as it's someone they don't know. \n If your child\u00a0is being seen at CAMHS, they might see a child and adolescent psychotherapist or a clinical psychologist. If they are at a youth counselling service, it will be a trained youth counsellor or psychotherapist. \n These sessions\u00a0can help them work out what is making them anxious and how they can\u00a0work through the situation. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help your child manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave. \n It has been proven to help with anxiety that isn't severe, and is commonly offered to young people who are anxious. \n Your child will work with the therapist to find ways to change the way they think and find strategies for coping\u00a0in situations that make them anxious. They'll usually have 9-20 sessions. \n It's not clear whether CBT is effective for children younger than six years of age. \n Medication \n If your child's anxiety problem has not got better, your doctor may talk to you about trying medication. \n A type of antidepressant, called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may help your child feel calmer and differently about things. \n Antidepressants usually take around two to four weeks to work properly, so you or your child may not notice the difference immediately. \n It's natural to be concerned about side effects. Your child should be aware of any possible adverse effects and should tell you or their doctor if they happen.\u00a0 \n What can I do to help my child? \n If a child is experiencing anxiety, there is plenty parents and carers can do to help. First, it's important to talk to your child about their anxiety or worries. \n Why are some children affected and others not? \n Some children are simply born more nervous and anxious and less able to cope with stress than other children. \n A\u00a0child's anxious personality may be partly determined by the genes they've inherited from their parents. Parents of anxious children may recognise the signs and remember feeling and behaving the same when they were younger. \n Stressful environment \n Children can pick up anxious behaviour from being around anxious people. \n Some children can also develop anxiety after a series of stressful events. They may be able to cope with one of these events, but several difficult events together may be too much for them to cope with. Examples are: \n \n Frequently moving house and school \u2013 it can be hard to settle when you're always expecting change \n Divorce or separation of parents, especially when there are new step parents and siblings (although many children will adapt to this and settle in time) \n Parents fighting or arguing \n Death of a close relative or friend \n Becoming seriously illor injured in an accident \n Having someone in the family who is ill or disabled \n School-related issues such as homework or exams, or\u00a0bullying or friendship problems \n Becoming involved in crime \n Being abused or neglected \n \n Medical conditions \n Children with certain conditions such as  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  and  autistic spectrum disorders  may experience anxiety as part of the symptoms of their condition, because of differences in the way their brain functions. \n How common are anxiety disorders in children? \n Nearly 300,000 young people in Britain have an anxiety disorder.\u00a0 \n In the UK, anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 5-19% of all children and adolescents, and about 2-5% of children younger than 12. \n Separation anxiety is the most common anxiety disorder in children younger than 12.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Angioedema", "introduction": "Angioedema is the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, caused by a build-up of fluid. \n The symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but\u00a0swelling usually\u00a0affects the: \n \n eyes \n lips \n genitals \n hands \n feet \n \n Many people with angioedema also experience  urticaria (hives) . This is a raised, red and itchy rash that appears on the skin. \n Read more about the  symptoms of angioedema . \n Why does angioedema happen? \n The cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. There are 4\u00a0main types of angioedema: \n \n allergic angioedema \u2013\u00a0the swelling is caused by an allergic reaction, such as a reaction to peanuts, and sometimes occurs in combination with  anaphylaxis  \n idiopathic angioedema \u2013\u00a0there is no known cause for the swelling (although certain factors, such as stress or infection, may trigger the symptoms) \n drug-induced angioedema \u2013\u00a0the swelling is a side effect of certain medications,\u00a0most often\u00a0angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors \n hereditary angioedema \u2013\u00a0the swelling is caused by \"faulty\" genes that are inherited from a person\u2019s parents \n \n Read more about the  causes of angioedema . \n Who is affected \n Angioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although\u00a0some types are more common than others. \n Hereditary angioedema is rare, only affecting between 1 in 10,000\u00a0and 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. \n Diagnosis \n Your doctor can\u00a0diagnose angioedema by examining the affected skin and\u00a0discussing symptoms. \n However, further tests, such as  blood tests \u00a0or allergy tests,\u00a0may be required to determine the type of angioedema. \n Idiopathic angioedema is only diagnosed if no cause can be found. \n Read more about  diagnosing angioedema . \n How is angioedema treated? \n Although most cases of angioedema get better without treatment after a few days, medication is often used. \n For cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines and\u00a0 oral steroids (steroid tablets)  can be used to relieve the swelling. \n Drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by\u00a0using an alternative medication to treat whatever underlying condition you have. \n Although the condition cannot be cured, regular drug treatment can prevent attacks in people with hereditary angioedema. \n Read more about  treating angioedema .", "symptoms": "The main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin's surface. \n Swollen skin \n The swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin. \n It most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. In severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below). \n The swelling\u00a0usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). It commonly lasts 1\u00a0to 3\u00a0days. There may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible. \n The swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also develop\u00a0 urticaria (hives) , which is red and itchy. \n Other symptoms \n As well as visible swellings, angioedema can cause other symptoms, including: \n \n a hot or painful\u00a0sensation in the swollen areas \n swelling of the inside of the throat, the\u00a0windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult \n swelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects\u00a0vision \n \n People with hereditary angioedema may also experience: \n \n abdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea \n swelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urine \n \n When to seek medical advice \n Contact your GP if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. You will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have. \n When to seek emergency medical advice \n Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencing  anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) . Tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis. \n Initial symptoms of anaphylaxis include: \n \n a feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to\u00a0breathing problems\u00a0 \n swelling of the tongue and throat \n \n If you, or the person in your care, has previously been prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector pen, you should use it while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.", "causes": "Angioedema is often caused by a problem with the immune system, although there are many cases where no cause can be identified. \n Allergic angioedema \n Normally, your immune system protects your body from illness and infection by attacking germs in your body. \n In allergic angioedema, your immune system mistakenly attacks harmless substances in your blood. Your body produces the chemical histamine, which causes the blood vessels in the area to expand, leading to swelling of the skin. \n Substances known to trigger allergic angioedema include: \n \n certain types of food \u2013 particularly nuts, shellfish, milk and eggs \n some types of medication\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as penicillin, aspirin and  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen \n  insect bites and stings  \u2013 particularly wasp and bee stings \n latex \u2013 a naturally occurring rubber used to make medical gloves, balloons and condoms \n \n Idiopathic angioedema \n Cases of angioedema without an identifiable cause are known as idiopathic angioedema. It may be that a problem with the immune system sometimes causes it to \"misfire\". \n In cases of\u00a0idiopathic angioedema, certain triggers may lead to swelling, such as: \n \n anxiety or stress \n minor infections \n hot or cold temperatures \n exercise \n \n Avoiding these triggers whenever possible may improve your symptoms. \n Drug-induced angioedema \n Some medications can cause angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are used to treat  high blood pressure (hypertension) , are usually responsible. \n It's estimated that around\u00a01-5% of\u00a0people taking ACE inhibitors will develop drug-induced angioedema. Black people being treated with ACE inhibitors are 3\u00a0to 4\u00a0times more likely to develop this side effect than white people. \n Around 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0cases of drug-induced angioedema occurs during the first month of taking an ACE inhibitor. The remaining cases develop many months or even years after treatment begins. \n While they are useful in lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors can sometimes disrupt the \"chemical balance\" and trigger an episode of severe swelling. \n Less common causes of drug-induced angioedema include: \n \n bupropion \u2013\u00a0a medication that helps people to  give up smoking  \n vaccines \n  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) \u00a0\u2013 a type of antidepressant \n COX-II inhibitors \u2013 a type of painkiller used to treat chronic pain conditions such as  arthritis  \n NSAIDs \u2013 a type of painkiller, such as aspirin or  ibuprofen  \n angiotensin-2 receptor antagonists \u2013\u00a0another medication used to treat high blood pressure \n  statins  \u2013\u00a0used to treat people with  high cholesterol levels  \n proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) \u2013\u00a0used to treat\u00a0 stomach ulcers  \n \n Hereditary angioedema \n Hereditary angioedema is caused by a genetic mutation (a change in the DNA) in the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) gene. Genes are single units of genetic material that code for characteristics such as eye and hair colour. \n As a result of the mutated C1-inh\u00a0gene, the body does not make enough C1-inh\u00a0protein. This protein plays an important role in regulating the immune system. Without enough C1-inh\u00a0protein, the immune system can misfire and trigger the symptoms of angioedema. \n Certain\u00a0things are thought to trigger hereditary angioedema, such as: \n \n trauma\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including surgery or infection \n the oral contraceptive pill \n pregnancy \n \n The mutated C1-inh gene is passed down through families. If you have hereditary angioedema, you have a\u00a050% chance of passing it on to your children.", "treatment": "Medication is the main treatment for angioedema, although many cases get better after a few days without treatment. \n Allergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema are usually treated in the same way, using a combination of antihistamines and\u00a0 corticosteroids  to help relieve the swelling. \n Drug-induced angioedema can usually be treated by using an alternative medication to the one causing your symptoms. \n If you also had symptoms of anaphylaxis during an episode of angioedema, you will probably be given an adrenaline auto-injector pen in case your symptoms return.\u00a0 \n Read more about\u00a0 treating anaphylaxis . \n Hereditary angioedema cannot be cured and does not respond to adrenaline, antihistamines or steroids, so a preventative approach is taken.\u00a0A number of different medications are used to stabilise the protein levels in your blood to help prevent symptoms developing. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines work by blocking the effects of a protein called histamine, which is one of the chemicals responsible for causing your skin to swell. \n A 2-week course of\u00a0a non-sedating type of antihistamine (which does not cause drowsiness) is usually recommended \u2013 these include fexofenadine and cetirizine. Cetirizine can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and supermarkets without a prescription. \n Antihistamines can also be given by injection at hospital or your GP surgery. \n If you also have\u00a0 urticaria (hives) \u00a0and are being kept awake at night by itchy skin, your GP may prescribe an older type of antihistamine\u00a0to take before going to bed. These types\u00a0cause drowsiness and should help you sleep. \n A minority of people will still experience drowsiness after taking the newer type of antihistamines. If you find yourself feeling drowsy, you should avoid: \n \n driving \n drinking alcohol \n operating complex or heavy machinery \n \n Other side effects of the newer antihistamines include: \n \n headache \n dry mouth \n dry nose \n \n These side effects are usually short-lived and should pass quickly. \n Corticosteroids \n  Corticosteroids (steroids)  work by blocking many of your immune system's actions. In most cases, a 3\u00a0to 5\u00a0day course of steroid tablets is recommended. A steroid called prednisolone is the preferred choice. \n Side effects of prednisolone include: \n \n nausea \n abdominal (stomach) pain \n tiredness \n  oral thrush \u00a0\u2013\u00a0a fungal infection inside your mouth \n dizziness \n \n If you feel dizzy after taking prednisolone, avoid driving and operating heavy machinery. These side effects should pass once you finish the course of treatment. \n Steroid injections may be needed for more severe cases of angioedema. These are usually administered in hospitals or at specialist clinics\u00a0by an allergy specialist or immunologist (a doctor who specialises in treating conditions that affect the immune system). \n Medication for hereditary angioedema \n The medication used to treat hereditary angioedema falls into 1\u00a0of 2\u00a0categories: \n \n medication used to prevent angioedema \n medication used to relieve symptoms \n \n Danazol \n Danazol is a synthetic hormone that is effective in preventing the symptoms of angioedema because it helps boost levels of the C1-inh protein. \n However, danazol can cause a number of unpleasant side effects if used on a long-term basis. For example, it may cause: \n \n weight gain \n  depression   \n disruption to the menstrual cycle\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0irregular periods or\u00a0absent periods \n  high blood pressure  \n in women, changes to the body that are usually associated with men\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as excessive\u00a0body hair growth, flattening of the chest, deepening of the voice and an increase in muscle tone \n liver problems \n \n Due to\u00a0these side effects, many people with hereditary angioedema are uneasy about using danazol on a long-term basis. Stanozolol is a similar medication that is slightly better tolerated. \n Tranexamic acid \n Tranexamic acid is also an alternative medication to danazol. It can be as effective as danazol, but does not cause as many side effects and is preferred for use in women. \n Icatibant \n Icatibant is a relatively new medication used to treat acute (short-lasting) episodes of swelling. It works by blocking the effects of some of the chemicals that are responsible for causing the swelling in cases of hereditary angioedema. \n Icatibant is given by injection under the skin, and a\u00a0second injection is often required. \n Common side effects of icatibant include: \n \n adverse skin reactions at the site of the injection\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as pain, redness, swelling or itchiness \n itchiness in other areas of the skin\u00a0\u00a0 \n dizziness \n \n C1-inhibitors \n Purified C1-inhibitor concentrate is widely used to replace the missing protein in the blood. It's needed for patients undergoing surgery, to prevent attacks caused by surgical trauma. It's used to treat acute attacks and is injected directly into the vein. \n Many patients will keep supplies of their concentrate at home for emergency use. \n Icatibant and C1-inhibitor concentrate will be prescribed by the specialist immunology unit caring for the patient with hereditary angioedema.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Angioedema is usually diagnosed by your doctor examining the affected skin and discussing your symptoms. \n It can be difficult to find the exact cause and identify which type of angioedema you have. There is no single test available, but you may have allergy tests or\u00a0blood tests if a specific cause is suspected. \n Allergic angioedema \n You're likely to be asked if\u00a0you have recently been exposed to any allergy-causing substances, such as nuts or latex.\u00a0You may also be asked whether you have a history of other allergic conditions, such as\u00a0 urticaria (hives)  or  asthma . People with an allergic condition often develop other allergic conditions. \n Tell your doctor about any medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medication, such as painkillers, herbal supplements and vitamins. \n Your GP may recommend that you keep a diary of your exposure to possible irritants \u2013 or a food diary, if a food allergy is suspected. \n If allergic angioedema is suspected, you are\u00a0likely to be referred to a specialist allergy or immunology clinic for further testing. Tests may include: \n \n a skin prick test \u2013\u00a0your skin is pricked with a tiny amount of the suspected allergen to see whether there is a reaction \n a\u00a0 blood test  \u2013 a sample of your blood is tested to determine whether your immune system reacts to a suspected allergen \n \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing allergies . \n Drug-induced angioedema \n If you are taking a medication known to cause drug-induced angioedema, your GP will withdraw that medication and prescribe an alternative. You should not stop taking any prescribed medication without advice from a health professional. \n If you don't have any further episodes of angioedema, a diagnosis of drug-induced angioedema can be made. \n Hereditary angioedema \n Hereditary angioedema can be diagnosed using a blood test to check the level of proteins regulated by the C1-inh gene. A very low level would suggest hereditary angioedema. \n The diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema is highly specialised and should be carried out in a specialist immunology clinic. \n Idiopathic angioedema \n Idiopathic angioedema is usually confirmed by a \"diagnosis of exclusion\". This means a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema can only be made after all the above tests have been carried out and a cause has not been found.\u00a0 \n As angioedema can be associated with other medical problems \u2013 such as an iron deficiency, liver diseases and problems with the thyroid gland \u2013 your doctor or specialist will undertake some simple blood tests to check for these conditions."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Anal cancer", "introduction": "Anal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the very end of the large bowel. \n Less\u00a0than\u00a01,200 people are diagnosed with cancer of the anus\u00a0each year in the UK. \n Symptoms of anal cancer \n The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles  (haemorrhoids)  and  anal fissures \u00a0(small tears or sores). \n Symptoms of anal cancer can include: \n \n bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding) \n itching and pain around the anus \n small lumps around the anus \n a discharge of mucus from the anus \n loss of bowel control  (bowel incontinence)  \n \n However, some people with anal cancer don't have any symptoms.\u00a0 \n See your GP if you develop any of the above symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it's best to get them checked out. \n Diagnosing anal cancer \n Your GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. \n They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your\u00a0bottom so they can\u00a0feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you\u00a0to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.\u00a0 \n The\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its\u00a0 2015 guidelines  that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump\u00a0or\u00a0anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within two weeks. \n If you're referred to\u00a0hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions. \n Some of the tests you may have include a: \n \n sigmoidoscopy \u2013\u00a0where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities \n proctoscopy \u2013\u00a0where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end \n  biopsy \u00a0\u2013\u00a0where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope\u00a0 \n \n If these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to \"stage\" the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread. \n You can read more about the\u00a0 stages of anal cancer  on the\u00a0Cancer Research UK website. \n How anal cancer is treated \n If you're diagnosed with anal cancer, you'll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care. \n The main treatments used for anal cancer are: \n \n chemoradiation \u2013 a combination of  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy  \n surgery \u2013 to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel \n \n In cases where the cancer has spread and can't be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as  palliative care . \n The main treatments are described in more detail below. \n Chemoradiation \n Chemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where\u00a0radiation\u00a0is used to kill cancer cells). It's currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don't usually need to stay in hospital when you're having chemoradiation. \n Chemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in two cycles, each lasting four to five days, with a four-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your\u00a0treatment has finished. \n The tube means you don't need to stay in\u00a0hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you'll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you. \n A few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC. \n Read more about\u00a0 how chemotherapy is carried out  \n Radiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for five to six weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required. \n Read more about  how radiotherapy is carried out  \n Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including: \n \n tiredness \n sore skin around the anus \n sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women \n  hair loss \u00a0\u2013 limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area \n feeling sick \n  diarrhoea  \n \n These side effects are usually temporary, but there's also a risk of longer-term problems, such as  infertility . If you're concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins.\u00a0 \n Other possible long-term side effects can include: \n \n  bowel control problems  \n long-term (chronic)\u00a0diarrhoea \n  erectile dysfunction  \n vaginal pain when having sex \n dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus \n bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder \n \n Tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated. \n Surgery \n Surgery is a less common treatment option\u00a0for anal cancer. It's usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily\u00a0removed, or if chemoradiation hasn't worked. \n If the tumour is very small and clearly defined,\u00a0it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under  general anaesthetic , that usually only requires a\u00a0stay in hospital of a few days. \n If chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic. \n An\u00a0abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You'll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery. \n During the operation,\u00a0a\u00a0permanent  colostomy  will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a\u00a0section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation. \n Before and after the operation, you'll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time. \n Read more about  living with a colostomy  \n Follow-up \n After your course of treatment ends, you'll need to have\u00a0regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning. \n To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they'll gradually\u00a0become less frequent over time. \n What causes anal cancer? \n The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: \n \n infection with  human papilloma virus (HPV) \u00a0\u2013 a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body \n having anal sex or lots of\u00a0sexual partners \u2013 possibly because this increases your risk of\u00a0developing HPV \n having a history of  cervical ,  vaginal  or  vulval cancer  \n smoking \n having a weakened immune system \u2013 for example, if you have  HIV  \n \n Your risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men. \n Outlook \n The outlook for anal cancer depends on how advanced the condition is when it's diagnosed. The earlier it's diagnosed, the better the outlook. \n Compared with many other types of cancer,\u00a0the outlook for anal cancer is generally better because treatment\u00a0is often very effective. Around 66 out of 100 people (66%)\u00a0with anal cancer will live at least five years after diagnosis, and many will live much longer than this.\u00a0There are about 300 deaths from anal cancer each year in the UK. \n Further information\u00a0about anal cancer \n \n Cancer Research UK:  anal cancer  \n Macmillan:\u00a0 anal cancer", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Anaphylaxis", "introduction": "Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly. \n It is also known as anaphylactic shock. \n Signs of anaphylaxis include: \n \n itchy skin or a raised, red skin rash \n swollen eyes, lips, hands and feet \n feeling lightheaded or faint \n swelling of the mouth, throat or tongue, which can cause breathing and swallowing difficulties \n wheezing \n abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting \n collapse and unconsciousness \n \n What to do \n Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. If available, an injection of a medicine called adrenaline\u00a0should be given as soon as possible. \n Some people with a previous history of anaphylaxis will have an auto-injector of adrenaline. \n This should be injected into their outer thigh muscle and held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device. \n You should call 999 for an ambulance whether adrenaline has been given or not. \n If after 5 to 10 minutes the person still feels unwell, a second injection should be given. This should be given in the opposite thigh. \n A second dose may also be needed if the person improves and then becomes unwell again. \n The person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table. If they are having difficulty breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier. \n If the person is unconscious, you should move them\u00a0to the\u00a0recovery position\u00a0\u2013 on their side, supported by one leg and one arm, with the head tilted back and the chin lifted. If the person's breathing or heart stops,\u00a0 cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \u00a0should be performed. \n Further treatment will be carried out in hospital. \n Read more about  treating anaphylaxis . \n Causes and triggers \n Anaphylaxis is the result of your body's immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens. \n Anaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to 4\u00a0hours later. \n The most widely reported triggers of anaphylaxis are: \n \n  insect stings \u00a0\u2013 particularly wasp and bee stings \n peanuts and tree nuts \n other types of foods\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as milk and seafood \n certain medicines\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as\u00a0 antibiotics  \n \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of anaphylaxis . \n Preventing further episodes \n If you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it's important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers. \n You should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future. \n You may be given two adrenaline auto-injectors to use during any future episodes of anaphylaxis. \n Read more about\u00a0 preventing anaphylaxis . \n Who is affected? \n Anaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as\u00a0 asthma  or the allergic skin condition\u00a0 atopic eczema , are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis. \n Although the condition is life threatening, deaths are rare. There are around 20 deaths in the UK each year. With prompt and proper treatment, most people make a full recovery.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Anaphylaxis is caused by a problem with the immune system, which is the body's natural defence against illness and infection. \n In the case of anaphylaxis, your immune system overreacts to a harmless substance and releases a number of different chemicals, such as histamine, to deal with the mistaken threat. \n Triggers \n Some of the more common triggers for anaphylaxis are shown below. \n Insect stings \n Most cases of anaphylaxis are caused by wasp and bee stings, although potentially any insect bite or sting can cause anaphylaxis. \n It's estimated around\u00a01 in 100 people will experience an allergic reaction after a wasp or bee sting, but only a small number of these people will go on to develop severe anaphylaxis. \n Foods \n More than half of all cases of food-related anaphylaxis are caused by peanuts. \n Other foods known to trigger anaphylaxis include: \n \n nuts\u00a0\u2013 such as walnuts, cashew nuts, almonds, brazil nuts and hazelnuts \n milk \n fish and shellfish \n eggs \n some types of fruit\u00a0\u2013 such as bananas, kiwi fruit, grapes and strawberries \n \n Medicines \n Medicines known to trigger anaphylaxis in a small amount of people include: \n \n  antibiotics \u00a0\u2013 particularly penicillin-like antibiotics \n  general anaesthetic \u00a0\u2013\u00a0muscle-relaxant medicines used during surgery\u00a0 \n  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u00a0\u2013 a type of painkiller that includes\u00a0 ibuprofen  and\u00a0aspirin \n \n People sensitive to these types of medicines will usually develop anaphylaxis as soon as they begin a course of treatment, although they may have safely received them in the past. \n The risk of anaphylaxis using these types of medicines is very small, so in most cases the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk. \n For example, the risk of developing anaphylaxis is around: \n \n 1 in 1,480\u00a0after taking a NSAID-type painkiller\u00a0 \n 1 in 5,000 after taking penicillin \n 1 in 10,000 after being given a general anaesthetic \n \n Contrast agents \n Contrast agents are a group of special dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of your body show up better on scans such as\u00a0 X-rays . \n For example, a contrast agent injected into a blood vessel will help show up any problems in the vessel, such as a blockage, on the X-ray. This is known as\u00a0 angiography . \n The risk of developing anaphylaxis after being injected with a contrast agent is thought to be less than\u00a01 in 10,000. \n Rubber latex \n Less than 1 in 100 people in the population has a\u00a0natural rubber latex allergy. Healthcare, hair, beauty, catering and motor industry workers are more likely to have a latex allergy. \n Those with a history of hayfever, asthma, eczema, and certain medical conditions, like spina bifida, are more likely to be affected. \n Idiopathic anaphylaxis \n Sometimes, despite extensive testing, no trigger can be found for anaphylaxis, and the cause remains unknown. This is known as idiopathic anaphylaxis.", "treatment": "If you think somebody is experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should use an adrenaline injector if one is available. Dial 999 immediately afterwards. \n Call 999 straight away if an adrenaline injector is not available. \n If you can see a potential trigger, such as a wasp or bee sting stuck in their skin, carefully remove it. \n Adrenaline injections \n Adrenaline causes the blood vessels to become narrower, which raises your blood pressure and reduces swelling. It also causes the airways to open, relieving breathing difficulties. \n An adrenaline injection should be given as soon as a serious reaction is suspected. \n The signs of suspected anaphylaxis are: \n \n problems breathing \n feeling faint or dizzy \n loss of consciousness \n \n The injection\u00a0can be done by the person with anaphylaxis, but sometimes\u00a0\u2013 if it's a young child or someone who is unconscious, for example\u00a0\u2013 another person may need to do it. \n Before attempting the injection, make sure you know what to do. You should read all of the instructions carefully when you, or the person you are responsible for, are first prescribed the injector. \n After injecting, the syringe should be held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Injections can be given through clothing. \n After injecting the adrenaline, you should immediately dial 999 for an ambulance, even if the person is starting to feel better. \n Most people should experience a rapid improvement in symptoms once the adrenaline has been used. \n If there's no improvement after 5 to 10 minutes, you should inject a second dose of adrenaline, if one is available. This should be injected into the opposite thigh. \n Read  Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 2014\u00a0guidelines on how to use an adrenaline auto-injector (PDF, 188kb) . \n Positioning and resuscitation \n In most cases, the person should lie flat, with their legs raised on a chair or a low table, to help maintain bloodflow to the head and heart. \n Pregnant women should lie down on their left side to avoid putting too much pressure on the large vein that leads to the heart. \n If the person is conscious but having trouble breathing, they should sit up to make breathing easier. \n If the person is unconscious, check that\u00a0their airways are open and clear, and also check their breathing. Then put them in the\u00a0 recovery position  to make sure they don't choke on their vomit. \n Place the person on their side, making sure they are supported by one leg and one arm. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin. \n If the person's breathing or heart stops,\u00a0 cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  should be performed. \n Admission to hospital \n Even if adrenaline is given, the person will need to go to hospital for observation\u00a0\u2013 usually for\u00a06 to 12 hours \u2013 as symptoms can occasionally return during this period. \n While in hospital, an oxygen mask can be used to help breathing, and fluids given by an intravenous drip directly into a vein can help increase blood pressure. \n As well as adrenaline, additional medications such as\u00a0antihistamines and  corticosteroids \u00a0can be used to help relieve symptoms.  Blood tests \u00a0may also be carried out while you're in hospital to confirm anaphylaxis. \n You should be able to leave hospital when the symptoms are under control and it's thought they will not return quickly. This may be after a few hours, but you may have to stay in hospital for a few days if the symptoms were severe. \n You may be asked to take antihistamines and corticosteroid tablets 2\u00a0to 3\u00a0days after leaving hospital to help stop your symptoms returning. \n You will probably be asked to attend a follow-up appointment so you can be given advice about how you can avoid further episodes of anaphylaxis. \n An adrenaline auto-injector may be given to you for emergency use between leaving hospital and attending the follow-up appointment. \n Read more about  preventing anaphylaxis .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Alzheimer's disease", "introduction": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 850,000 people in the UK. \n  Dementia  is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory. \n The exact cause\u00a0of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: \n \n increasing age \n a family history of the condition \n previous\u00a0 severe head injuries  \n lifestyle factors and conditions associated with  cardiovascular disease  \n \n It's becoming increasingly understood that it's very common to have both changes of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia together (mixed dementia). \n Read more about the  causes of Alzheimer's disease  \n Signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease \n Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of\u00a0several years. It affects multiple brain functions. \n The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be\u00a0forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. \n As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and\u00a0further symptoms can develop, such as: \n \n confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places \n difficulty planning or making decisions \n problems with speech and language \n problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks \n personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others \n hallucinations\u00a0(seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue) \n low mood\u00a0or anxiety \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of Alzheimer's disease  \n Who is affected? \n Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age\u00a0of\u00a065, and affects slightly more women than men. \n The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia\u00a0increases with age,\u00a0affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. \n However, around\u00a01 in every 20 cases of Alzheimer's disease affects people aged 40 to 65. \n Receiving\u00a0a diagnosis \n As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. \n However,\u00a0a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you\u00a0the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support\u00a0that may help. \n If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. \n There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Your GP will ask questions about any problems you are experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. \n If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist memory service to: \n \n discuss the process of making the diagnosis \n organise testing\u00a0 \n create a treatment plan \n \n Read more about  diagnosing Alzheimer's disease  \n How Alzheimer's disease is treated \n There's no cure for Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0but medication is available that can help\u00a0relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people. \n Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks. \n Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to\u00a0help\u00a0support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. \n Read more about  treating Alzheimer's disease  \n Outlook \n On average, people with Alzheimer's disease live for around\u00a08 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not. \n Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. \n As\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs) which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease to eventually have difficulty eating and to have a reduced appetite.\u00a0 \n There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease need\u00a0 palliative care . This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's. \n Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented? \n As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease isn't clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: \n \n  stopping\u00a0smoking \u00a0and  cutting down on alcohol  \n eating a  healthy, balanced diet  and maintaining a healthy weight \n staying  physically fit  and mentally active \n \n These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health. \n Read more about  preventing Alzheimer's disease", "symptoms": "The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly over several years. Sometimes these symptoms are confused with other conditions and may initially be put down to old age. \n The rate at which the symptoms progress is different for each individual and it's not possible to predict exactly how quickly it will get worse. \n In some cases,\u00a0infections, medications, strokes or delirium\u00a0can be responsible for symptoms getting worse. Anyone with Alzheimer's disease whose symptoms are rapidly getting worse should be seen by a doctor, so these can be managed. \n Stages of Alzheimer's disease \n Generally, the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are divided into\u00a0three main stages. \n Early symptoms \n In the early stages, the main symptom of\u00a0Alzheimer's disease is memory lapses. For example, someone with early Alzheimer's disease may: \n \n forget about recent conversations or events, or misplace items \n forget the names of places and objects, or have trouble thinking of the right word \n repeat themselves regularly, such as asking the same question several times \n show poor judgement or find it harder to make decisions \n become less flexible and more hesitant to try new things \n \n There are often signs of\u00a0mood changes, such as increasing  anxiety  or agitation, or periods of confusion. \n Middle-stage symptoms \n As Alzheimer's disease develops, memory problems will get worse. Someone with the condition may find it increasingly difficult to remember\u00a0the names of people they know and may struggle to recognise their family and friends. \n Other symptoms may also develop, such as: \n \n increasing confusion and disorientation\u00a0\u2013 for example, getting lost, or wandering and not knowing what time of day it is \n obsessive, repetitive or impulsive behaviour \n delusions (believing things that are untrue) or feeling paranoid and suspicious about carers or family members \n problems with speech\u00a0or\u00a0language (aphasia) \n disturbed sleep \n changes in\u00a0mood, such as frequent mood swings,  depression  and feeling\u00a0increasingly anxious, frustrated or agitated \n difficulty performing\u00a0spatial tasks, such as\u00a0judging distances \n hallucinations \n \n By this stage, someone with Alzheimer's disease usually needs support to help them with their everyday living. For example, they may\u00a0need help eating, washing, getting dressed and using the toilet. \n Later symptoms \n In the later stages of Alzheimer's disease, the symptoms become increasingly severe and distressing for the person with the condition, as well as their carers, friends and family. \n Hallucinations and delusions may come and go over the course of the illness, but can get\u00a0worse as the condition progresses. Sometimes people with Alzheimer's disease can be\u00a0violent, demanding and suspicious of those around them. \n A number of other symptoms may also develop as Alzheimer's disease progresses, such as: \n \n  difficulty eating and swallowing (dysphagia)  \n difficulty changing position or moving around without assistance \n considerable weight loss \u2013 although some people eat too much and put on weight \n  unintentional passing of\u00a0urine (urinary incontinence)  or stools ( bowel incontinence ) \n gradual loss of speech \n significant problems with short- and long-term memory \n \n In the severe stages of Alzheimer's disease, people may need full-time care and assistance with eating, moving and using the toilet. \n Read more about  how Alzheimer's disease is treated  \n Seeking medical advice \n If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, you should encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. \n Memory problems are not just caused by dementia \u2013 they\u00a0can also be caused by depression, stress, medications or other health problems. Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be, and they can refer you to a specialist for more tests, if necessary. \n Read more about  diagnosing Alzheimer's disease", "causes": "Alzheimer's disease is caused by parts of the brain shrinking (atrophy), which affects the structure and function of particular brain areas. \n It's not known exactly what causes this process to begin. However,\u00a0in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, scientists\u00a0have found\u00a0amyloid plaques (abnormal deposits of protein), neurofibrillary tangles (containing tau) and imbalances in a chemical called acetylcholine. \n It's also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain. \n These\u00a0reduce the effectiveness of\u00a0healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them. \n Over time, this damage spreads to\u00a0several areas of the brain. The first areas affected are responsible for memories. \n Increased risk \n Although it's still unknown what triggers\u00a0Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0several factors are known to increase your risk of developing the condition. \n Age \n Age is the single most significant factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The likelihood of developing the condition doubles every five years after you reach 65 years of age. \n However, it's not just older people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Around\u00a01 in\u00a020\u00a0people with the condition are under 65.\u00a0This is called early onset Alzheimer's disease and\u00a0it can affect people from around the age of 40. \n Family history \n The genes you inherit from\u00a0your parents can contribute to your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, although the actual increase in risk is small if you have a\u00a0close family member with the condition. \n However, in a few families, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the inheritance of a single gene, and the risks of the condition\u00a0being passed on are much higher. \n If several of your family members have developed dementia over the generations, it may be appropriate to seek genetic counselling\u00a0for information and advice about your chances of developing Alzheimer's disease when you are older. \n The Alzheimer's\u00a0Society website has more information about the  genetics of dementia . \n Down's syndrome \n People with\u00a0 Down's syndrome  are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. \n This is because the genetic fault that causes Down's syndrome can also cause amyloid plaques to build up in the brain over time, which can lead to Alzheimer's disease in some people. \n Head injuries \n People who have had a  severe head injury  have been found to be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. \n Cardiovascular disease \n Research shows that several lifestyle factors and conditions associated with\u00a0 cardiovascular disease  can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. \n These include: \n \n  smoking  \n  obesity \u00a0 \n  diabetes \u00a0 \n  high blood pressure  \n  high cholesterol  \n \n You can help reduce your risk by: \n \n stopping smoking \n  eating a healthy, balanced diet  \n leading an active life, both physically and mentally \n losing weight if you need to \n drinking less alcohol \n having\u00a0regular health checks as you get older \n \n Read more about  reducing your risk of Alzheimer's disease", "treatment": "There's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, although medication is available that can temporarily reduce some symptoms or slow down the progression of the condition in some people. \n Support is also available to help someone with the condition cope with everyday life. \n Care plan \n If you're diagnosed with\u00a0Alzheimer's disease, it's helpful if your health and social care needs are assessed and plans made for\u00a0the future. \n A care plan is a way of ensuring you receive the right treatment for your needs. It involves identifying areas where you may need some assistance, such as: \n \n what support you or your carer need for you to remain as independent as possible \n whether there are any changes that need to be made to your home to make it easier to live in \n whether you need any financial assistance \n \n Healthcare professionals (such as your GP or psychiatrist) and  social care services \u00a0(which is normally your local council working with the NHS), will usually both be involved in helping draw up and carry out care plans. \n Medication \n A\u00a0number of medications\u00a0may be prescribed for Alzheimer's disease to help temporarily improve some symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition. \n Donepezil,\u00a0galantamine\u00a0and rivastigmine (known as AChE inhibitors)\u00a0can be prescribed for people with early to mid-stage Alzheimer's disease. Memantine may be prescribed for people with mid-stage disease who cannot take AChE inhibitors, or\u00a0for those with\u00a0late-stage disease. \n There's no difference in how well each of the three different AChE inhibitors work, although\u00a0some people\u00a0respond better\u00a0to\u00a0certain types or have fewer side effects. \n All of these medications can only be prescribed by specialists such as psychiatrists, neurologists and geriatricians. They may be prescribed by your GP on the advice of a specialist. \n If you're caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease, your views should be taken into account when prescribing medication, as well as at regular assessments. These assessments take place to ensure the medication is having a worthwhile effect and to identify and monitor side effects. \n Read guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on  donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease . \n Side effects \n Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine\u00a0can cause side effects\u00a0such as: \n \n feeling and being sick \n dizziness \n  diarrhoea \u00a0 \n  headache \u00a0 \n agitation \n  insomnia  \n muscle cramps \n more rarely, slowing of the heartbeat\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which can cause issues if you already have problems with your heart rhythm. \n \n These side effects are more likely to occur at the beginning of therapy or when the dose is increased. Your doctor should review your medical history and your other medications to check the suitability and risk of interactions. \n Common side effects of memantine include: \n \n dizziness \n headaches \n high blood pressure \n tiredness \n  constipation  \n  shortness of breath  \n more rarely, problems with walking or increased confusion \n very rarely, seizures \n \n For more information about the possible side effects of your specific medication, refer to the patient information leaflet that comes with it or speak to your doctor. \n Supportive measures and treatments \n In addition to medication, treatment for Alzheimer's disease involves a wide range of other measures and treatments to help\u00a0people with dementia\u00a0live as independently as possible. \n For example, an\u00a0 occupational therapist  can identify problems or unsafe areas\u00a0in your everyday life and help you to develop strategies or use alternative tools to manage these. They may suggest: \n \n ways of prompting and reminding yourself of important tasks\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as using diaries or calendars \n assistive technology\u00a0\u2013\u00a0devices or systems to help maintain the independence and\u00a0safety of people living with dementia \n adding grab bars and handrails to your home to help you move around safely \n other professionals visiting you at home and assisting with daily tasks to maintain your independence in the community \n \n Psychological treatments, such as cognitive stimulation,\u00a0may be offered to\u00a0help improve your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. \n Medication, other psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), music and art therapy, reminiscence and relaxation therapies may also be offered. These may help with managing  depression , anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, delusions and challenging behaviour that can occur with Alzheimer's disease. \n Read more about  how dementia is treated  \n Practical tips for people with Alzheimer's \n If you have Alzheimer's disease, you may find it useful to: \n \n keep a diary and write down things you want to remember \n pin a weekly timetable to the wall \n put your keys in an obvious place, such as in a large bowl in your living room \n have a daily newspaper delivered to remind you of the day and date \n put labels on cupboards and drawers \n keep useful telephone numbers by the phone \n write yourself reminders\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, put a note on the front door to remind you to take your keys with you if you go out \n programme people's names and numbers into your telephone \n set the alarm on your watch to act as a reminder \n install safety devices such as gas detectors and smoke alarms throughout your home \n \n It may also be helpful to\u00a0get in touch with a local or national Alzheimer's or dementia support group, such as the  Alzheimer's Society , for more information and advice about living with Alzheimer's disease. \n Read more about  living well with dementia  \n Advance care planning \n People with dementia often live for many years after their diagnosis. However, as it's a progressive condition, it can be helpful and reassuring for both you and your family if you make plans for the future. \n Advance care planning means considering, discussing and possibly recording your wishes and decisions for future care. It's about planning for a time when you may not be able to make some decisions for yourself. \n In the earlier stages of the disease, you should have the opportunity to discuss with health professionals and your family about the future. This may involve the use of: \n \n  advance statements \u00a0 \n advance decisions to refuse treatment \n  lasting power of attorney  \n  preferred priorities\u00a0for care  \n \n Palliative care \n Although the outlook is variable, dementia is a life-limiting illness and can begin to affect multiple body systems in the later stages. \n End of life care, or palliative care, provides support for people with an incurable illness, so they're able to live as well and as comfortably as possible until their death. It also involves support for family members. Care\u00a0may be provided at home, a hospice, a care home or hospital. \n For people nearing the end of life, their care team should assess their needs, make them feel comfortable and allow them to die with dignity in a place of their choosing. \n Read more about  palliative care", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "It's best to see your GP if you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia. \n If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest going with them. It's often very helpful having a friend or family member there. \n A timely\u00a0diagnosis gives you the best chance to adjust, prepare and plan for the future, as well as accessing treatments and support that may help. \n Seeing your GP \n Memory problems aren't just caused by dementia\u00a0\u2013 they can also be caused by: \n \n  depression  or  anxiety  \n stress \n medications \n alcohol or drugs \n other health problems \u2013 such as hormonal disturbances or nutritional deficiencies \n \n Your GP can carry out some simple checks to try to find out what the cause may be. They\u00a0can then refer you to a specialist for assessment, if necessary. \n Your GP will ask about your concerns and what you or your family have noticed. They'll also check\u00a0other aspects of your health, and carry out a physical examination. They may also organise some\u00a0 blood tests  and ask about any medication you're taking to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. \n You'll usually be asked some questions\u00a0and carry out\u00a0some\u00a0memory, thinking, and pen and paper tasks to check how different areas of your brain are functioning. This can help your GP decide if you\u00a0need to\u00a0be referred to a specialist for more assessments. \n Referral to a specialist \n Your GP may refer you to a specialist memory assessment service to help with your diagnosis. Memory clinics are staffed by professionals from multiple disciplines who are experts in diagnosing, caring for and advising people with dementia and their families. \n Memory clinic staff can include the following, depending on your local area: \n \n a nurse \u2013 usually a trained mental health nurse who specialises in diagnosing and caring for people with dementia \n a psychologist \u2013 a healthcare professional who specialises in the assessment and treatment of mental health conditions \n a psychiatrist \u2013 a qualified medical doctor who has training in treating mental health conditions \n a neurologist \u2013 a specialist in treating conditions that affect the nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) \n a geriatrician \u2013 a physician with specialist training in the care of older people \n a social worker \u2013 a trained member of staff able to advise and assist with accessing social services within the local area \n an occupational therapist \u2013 a member of staff with specialist skills in assessing and supporting people with dementia and their families with adjusting to disabilities \n \n There's no simple and reliable test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0but\u00a0the staff will listen to the concerns of both you and your family about your memory or thinking. They will assess your skills and arrange more tests to rule out other conditions. \n Assessing your mental abilities\u00a0 \n A specialist will usually assess your mental abilities using a special series of questions. \n One widely used test is the mini mental state examination (MMSE). This involves being asked to carry out activities such as memorising a short list of objects\u00a0correctly and identifying the current day of the week, month and year. Different memory clinics may also use other, longer tests.\u00a0 \n The MMSE isn't used to diagnose\u00a0Alzheimer's disease,\u00a0but it's useful to initially assess areas of difficulty that a person with\u00a0the condition may have. This helps specialists to make decisions about treatment and whether more tests are necessary. \n Tests \n To rule out other possible causes of your symptoms and look for possible signs of damage caused by Alzheimer's disease, your specialist may recommend having a brain scan. This could be a: \n \n  computerised tomography (CT) scan \u00a0\u2013 where several X-rays of your brain are taken at slightly different angles and a computer is used to put the images together \n  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan \u00a0\u2013 where a strong magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce detailed images of the inside of your brain\u00a0 \n \n Some specialist centres offer scans which look at brain function and particular protein deposits. However, at the moment, these are mostly experimental and only used if the diagnosis is unclear.\u00a0 \n After\u00a0diagnosis \n It may take several\u00a0appointments and tests over months, or even years, before a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can be confirmed. \n For some people, a diagnosis of\u00a0Alzheimer's disease is a huge shock, especially as it's not unusual for people with dementia to have less awareness of their difficulties. \n For others, the diagnosis can be very important in helping them and their families to make sense of symptoms they've been concerned about for a long time. \n If you've just been given a diagnosis of dementia, you may be feeling numb, scared and unable to take everything in. It may be helpful to have the diagnosis explained again to help make sense of the idea over time. It might help to talk\u00a0things through with family and friends. \n It takes time to adapt to a diagnosis of dementia, for both you and your family. Some people find it helpful to seek information and plan for the future, but others may need a longer period to process the news. \n However, as dementia is a progressive illness, the weeks to months after a diagnosis is often a good time to think about legal, financial and healthcare matters for the future. \n Read more about\u00a0 what to do if you've just been diagnosed with dementia"},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Ankylosing spondylitis", "introduction": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the spine and other areas of the body become inflamed. \n The\u00a0symptoms of AS can vary but usually involve: \n \n back pain and stiffness that improves with exercise and isn't relieved by rest \n pain and swelling in other parts of the body, such as the hips, knees and ribs \n fatigue (extreme tiredness) \n \n These symptoms tend to develop gradually, usually over several months or years, and may come and go over time. \n In some people, the condition gets better with time, but for others it can get slowly worse. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis \u00a0 \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS. \n If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they\u00a0should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis . \n What causes ankylosing spondylitis? \n In AS, various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed. \n As well as causing\u00a0pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time, and in some cases can lead to\u00a0some of the individual bones of the spine fusing (joining together). This fusing of the spine is known as ankylosis. \n It is not known what causes the condition, but there is thought to be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27. \n Read more about the  causes of ankylosing spondylitis . \n Who is affected \n AS tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. Most cases first start in people aged 20-30, with only a minority of cases first affecting adults over 45. \n AS is around three times more common in men than in women. \n There are around 200,000 people in the UK who have been diagnosed with the condition. \n How ankylosing spondylitis is treated \n There is no cure for AS and it is not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression. \n In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of: \n \n exercises carried out individually or in groups to reduce pain and stiffness \n physiotherapy \u2013 where physical methods, such as massage and manipulation, are used to improve comfort and spinal flexibility \n medication to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation \u2013 such as\u00a0painkillers and\u00a0a type of medicine called\u00a0anti-TNF medication \n \n Surgery is sometimes needed to repair significantly damaged joints or correct severe bends in the spine, but this is uncommon. \n Read more about  treating\u00a0ankylosing spondylitis . \n Outlook \n The outlook for AS is highly variable. For some people, the condition improves after an initial period of inflammation, whereas for others the condition can get progressively worse over time. \n Around 70-90% of people with AS\u00a0remain fully independent or minimally disabled in the long term. However,\u00a0some people eventually become severely disabled due to the bones in their spine fusing in a fixed position and damage to other joints, such as the hips or knees. \n With modern treatments, AS doesn't normally affect life expectancy significantly, although the condition is associated with an increased risk of other potentially life-threatening\u00a0problems. \n For example, AS can lead to  osteoporosis  (weakening of the bones), spinal fractures and  cardiovascular disease  (a group of conditions affecting the heart\u00a0and blood vessels). \n Read\u00a0more about the\u00a0 complications of ankylosing spondylitis . \n Information about you \n If you have AS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register .", "symptoms": "The symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can vary from person to person, but usually develop slowly, over several months or years. \n AS\u00a0usually first starts to develop\u00a0during\u00a0later teenage years or early adulthood. The symptoms may\u00a0come and go, and improve or get worse over many years. \n Main symptoms \n The main symptoms of\u00a0AS are described below, although you may not develop all of these if you have the condition.\u00a0 \n Back pain and stiffness \n Back pain\u00a0and stiffness are usually the main symptoms of AS.\u00a0You may find: \n \n the\u00a0pain gets better with exercise but doesn't improve, or gets worse, with rest \n the pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and at night \u2013 you may wake up regularly during the night because of the pain \n you have pain in\u00a0the area around your\u00a0buttocks \n \n Arthritis \n As well as causing symptoms in your back and spine, AS can\u00a0also cause inflammation of the joints ( arthritis ) in other parts of your body, such as your hips and knees. The main symptoms associated with arthritis are: \n \n pain on moving the affected joint \n tenderness when the affected joint is examined \n swelling and warmth in the affected area\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Enthesitis \n Enthesitis is painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon (a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) or a ligament (a band of tissue that connects bones to bones). \n Common sites for enthesitis are: \n \n at the top of the shin bone \n behind the heel (Achilles tendon) \n under the heel \n where\u00a0the ribs join to the breast bone \n \n If your ribs are affected, you may experience chest pain, and you may find it difficult to expand your chest when breathing deeply. \n Fatigue \n Fatigue is a common symptom of untreated AS. It can make you feel tired and lacking in energy. \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS. \n If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment. \n Read more about  diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis .", "causes": "In ankylosing spondylitis (AS), several parts of the lower spine become inflamed, including the vertebrae (bones in the spine) and spinal joints. \n Over time, this can damage the spine and lead to the growth of new bone, which in some cases can cause parts of the spine to join up (fuse) and lose flexibility. This is known as ankylosis. \n It is not known exactly what causes AS, but in many cases there seems to\u00a0be a link with a particular gene known as HLA-B27. \n HLA-B27 gene \n Research has shown that more than 9 out of 10 people\u00a0with AS carry a particular gene known as human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27). \n Having this gene does not necessarily mean\u00a0you will develop AS. It is estimated that 8 in every 100 people in the general population have the HLA-B27 gene, but most do not have AS. \n It is thought that having this gene may make you more vulnerable to developing AS, and the condition is triggered by one or more environmental factors \u2013 although it is not known what these are. \n Testing for this gene may be carried out if AS is suspected. However, this test\u00a0is not a very reliable method of diagnosing the condition because some people can have the HLA-B27 gene but not have ankylosing spondylitis. \n Read about  how ankylosing spondylitis is diagnosed . \n Can ankylosing spondylitis be inherited? \n AS\u00a0can run in families, and the HLA-B27 gene can be inherited from another family member. \n If you\u00a0have\u00a0AS and tests have shown you carry the HLA-B27 gene, the chance of\u00a0any children you have developing the condition is less than 20%. If you have AS but don't carry the HLA-B27 gene,\u00a0the chance of any children you have developing the condition is less than 10%. \n If you have a close relative who has AS, such as a parent or a sibling (brother or sister), you are three times more likely to develop the condition compared with someone who does not have a relative with the condition.", "treatment": "There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis (AS), but treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms. \n Treatment can also help delay or prevent the process of the spine fusing (joining up) and stiffening. \n In most cases, treatment will involve a combination of exercise, physiotherapy and medication, which are described below. \n Physiotherapy and exercise \n Keeping active can improve your posture and range of spinal movement, along with preventing your spine from becoming stiff and painful. \n As well as keeping active, physiotherapy is a key part of treating AS. A physiotherapist (a healthcare professional trained in using physical methods of treatment) can advise about the most effective exercises and draw up an exercise programme that suits you. \n Types of physiotherapy recommended for AS include: \n \n a group exercise programme \u2013 where you exercise with others \n an individual exercise programme \u2013 you are given exercises to do by yourself \n massage \u2013 your muscles and other soft tissues are manipulated to relieve pain and improve movement (the bones of the spine should never be manipulated as this can cause injury in people with AS) \n hydrotherapy \u2013 exercise in water (usually a warm, shallow swimming pool or a special hydrotherapy bath); the\u00a0buoyancy of\u00a0the water helps make movement easier\u00a0by supporting you, and the warmth can relax your muscles\u00a0 \n \n Some people prefer to swim or play sport to keep flexible. This is usually fine, although some daily stretching and exercise is also important. \n If you're ever in doubt, speak to your physiotherapist or rheumatologist before taking up a new form of sport or exercise. \n The  National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society (NASS)  provides detailed information about different types of exercise to help you manage your condition.\u00a0 \n Painkillers \n You may need painkillers to manage your condition while you are being referred to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist may continue prescribing painkillers, although not everyone needs them all the time. \n Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \n The first type of painkiller usually prescribed is a  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) . As well as helping to ease pain, NSAIDs can help relieve swelling (inflammation) in your joints. \n Examples of NSAIDs include  ibuprofen , naproxen and diclofenac. \n When prescribing NSAIDs, your GP or rheumatologist will try to find the one that suits you, and the lowest possible dose that relieves your symptoms. Your dose will be monitored and reviewed as necessary. \n Paracetamol \n If NSAIDs are unsuitable for you, an alternative painkiller, such as  paracetamol , may be recommended. \n Paracetamol rarely causes side effects and can be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, paracetamol may not be suitable for people with liver problems or those dependent on alcohol. \n Codeine \n If necessary, as well as paracetamol, you may also be prescribed a stronger type of painkiller called codeine. \n Codeine can cause side effects including\u00a0feeling sick, vomiting,\u00a0 constipation  and drowsiness. \n Anti-TNF medication \n If your symptoms cannot be controlled using painkillers or exercising and stretching, anti-TNF (tumour necrosis factor) medication may be recommended. TNF is a chemical produced by cells when tissue is inflamed. \n Anti-TNF medications are given by injection and work by preventing the effects of TNF, as well as reducing inflammation in your joints caused by ankylosing spondylitis. \n Examples of anti-TNF medication include adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab. \n These are relatively new treatments for AS, and their long-term effects are unknown. \n However, they have been used for longer in people with\u00a0 rheumatoid arthritis ,\u00a0and this is providing clearer information about their long-term safety. \n If your rheumatologist recommends using anti-TNF medication, the decision about whether they are right for you must be discussed carefully and your progress will be closely monitored. This is because anti-TNF medication can interfere with the immune system (the body\u2019s natural defence system), increasing your risk of developing potentially serious infections. \n NICE guidelines \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced guidance about the use of\u00a0anti-TNF medication for AS. NICE states that adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab may only be used if: \n \n your  diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis  has been confirmed \n your level of pain is assessed twice (using a simple scale that you fill in) 12 weeks apart and confirms your condition has not improved \n your\u00a0 Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)  is tested twice, 12 weeks apart, and confirms your condition\u00a0has not improved \u2013 BASDAI is a set of measures devised by experts to evaluate your condition, by asking a number of questions about your symptoms \n treatment with two or more NSAIDs for four weeks at the highest possible dose has not controlled your symptoms \n \n After 12 weeks of treatment with anti-TNF medication, your pain score and BASDAI will be tested again to see whether they have improved enough to make continuing treatment worthwhile. If they have, treatment will continue and you will be tested every 12 weeks. \n If there is not enough improvement after 12 weeks, you will be tested\u00a0again at a later date\u00a0or the treatment will be stopped. \n Corticosteroids \n  Corticosteroids  have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and can be taken as tablets or injections by people with AS. \n If a particular joint is inflamed, corticosteroids can be injected directly into the joint. After the injection, you will need to rest the joint for up to 48 hours. \n It is usually considered wise to have a corticosteroid injection up to three times in one year, with at least three months between injections in the same joint. This is because corticosteroids injections can cause a number of side effects, such as: \n \n infection in response to the injection \n the skin around the injection may change colour (depigmentation) \n the surrounding tissue may waste away \n a tendon (cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) near the joint may rupture (burst) \n \n Corticosteroids may also calm down painful swollen joints when taken as tablets. \n Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \n Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are an alternative type of medication often used to treat other types of arthritis. \n DMARDs may be prescribed for AS, although they are only beneficial in treating pain and inflammation in joints in areas of the body other than the spine. \n Two DMARDs sometimes used to treat inflammation of joints other than the spine include sulfasalazine and methotrexate. \n Surgery \n Most people with AS will not need surgery. \n However, in cases where a joint has become severely damaged,\u00a0joint replacement surgery may be recommended to improve pain and movement in the affect joint. For example, if the\u00a0hip joints are affected, a\u00a0 hip replacement  may be carried out. \n In rare cases, corrective surgery may be needed\u00a0if the spine becomes badly bent. \n Follow-up \n As the symptoms of\u00a0AS develop slowly and tend to come and go, you will need to see your rheumatologist or GP for regular check-ups. \n They will make sure your treatment is working properly and may carry out physical assessments to assess how your condition is progressing. This may involve further sets of the same blood tests or X-rays you had at the time of your diagnosis. \n Any  complications of ankylosing spondylitis  that arise will be treated as they develop.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can be difficult to diagnose because the condition develops slowly and there is no definitive test to confirm a diagnosis. \n The first thing you should do if you think you have AS is to see your GP. They will ask about your symptoms, including what symptoms you are experiencing, when they started and how long you have had them. \n Back pain associated with\u00a0AS can be\u00a0quite distinctive. For example, it usually doesn't improve with rest and may wake you up during the night. \n Blood tests \n If your GP suspects AS, they may arrange  blood tests \u00a0to check for signs of inflammation in your body.\u00a0Inflammation in your spine and joints is one of the main symptoms of the condition. \n If your\u00a0results\u00a0suggest you do have inflammation, you\u00a0will be referred to a rheumatologist for further tests. A rheumatologist is a specialist in conditions that affect muscles and joints. \n Further tests \n Your rheumatologist will carry out imaging tests to examine the appearance of your spine and pelvis, as well as further blood tests. These are described below. \n X-rays \n An\u00a0 X-ray  of your lower back can show\u00a0damage to the joints at the base of your spine (the sacroiliac joints) and\u00a0new bone forming between the vertebrae (bones in your spine), which are common signs of advanced AS. \n MRI scan \n A\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  may highlight changes in your sacroiliac joints that might not show up on an X-ray. It may also show any inflammation of ligaments in the spinal region. \n Ultrasound scan \n An\u00a0 ultrasound scan  can pick up inflammation of the tissues (tendons and ligaments) attached to your bones. \n Genetic testing \n A genetic blood test\u00a0may sometimes\u00a0be carried out to see if you carry the\u00a0HLA-B27 gene, which is found in most people with AS. \n This can contribute towards a diagnosis of AS, but it is not entirely reliable as not everyone with\u00a0the condition\u00a0has this gene, and some people have the gene without ever developing AS. \n Confirming ankylosing spondylitis \n Although scans can sometimes show spinal inflammation and fusing of the spine (ankylosis), damage to the spine cannot always be picked up in the early stages of AS. \n This is why\u00a0diagnosis is often difficult. In many cases, confirming a diagnosis is a long process that can take years. \n A diagnosis of AS can\u00a0usually\u00a0be confirmed if an X-ray shows sacroiliitis (inflammation of the sacroiliac joints) and you have at least one of the following: \n \n at least three months of lower back pain that gets better with exercise and doesn't improve with rest \n limited movement in your lumbar spine (lower back) \n limited chest expansion compared to what is expected for your age and sex \n \n If you have all three of these features but do not have sacroiliitis \u2013 or if you only have sacroiliitis \u2013 you will be diagnosed with \"probable ankylosing spondylitis\"."},

They're thought to\u00a0affect more than 1\u00a0in 4\u00a0people in the UK at some point in their lives. \n They\u00a0are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although\u00a0many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren't previously allergic to. \n Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. \n Common allergies \n Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens.\u00a0The more common allergens\u00a0include: \n \n grass and tree pollen\u00a0\u2013 an allergy to these\u00a0is known as  hay fever  (allergic rhinitis) \n dust mites \n animal dander (tiny flakes of skin or hair) \n  food \u00a0\u2013 particularly\u00a0nuts, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cow's milk \n  insect bites and stings  \n medication \u2013\u00a0including\u00a0 ibuprofen , aspirin, and certain\u00a0 antibiotics  \n latex\u00a0\u2013 used to make\u00a0some gloves and  condoms  \n mould\u00a0\u2013 these can release small particles into the air that you can breathe in \n household chemicals\u00a0\u2013 including those in detergents and hair dyes \n \n Most of these\u00a0allergens\u00a0are generally harmless to people who aren't allergic to them. \n Symptoms of an allergic reaction \n Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen. \n They can cause: \n \n sneezing \n a runny or blocked\u00a0nose \n red, itchy, watery eyes \n wheezing and coughing \n a red, itchy rash \n worsening of\u00a0 asthma  or\u00a0 eczema  symptoms \n \n Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called  anaphylaxis  or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is\u00a0a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment. \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of allergies . \n Getting help for allergies \n See your GP if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. \n The symptoms of an allergic reaction\u00a0can also\u00a0be caused by other conditions. Your GP can help determine whether it's likely you have an allergy. \n If your GP thinks you might have a\u00a0mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. \n If your allergy is particularly severe or it's not clear what you're allergic to, your GP\u00a0may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment. \n Read more about\u00a0 allergy testing . \n How to manage an allergy \n In\u00a0many cases, the most effective way of managing\u00a0an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible. \n For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more  information about food allergen labelling . \n There are also several medications available to\u00a0help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including: \n \n antihistamines\u00a0\u2013 these can be taken when you notice the symptoms of a reaction, or before being exposed to an allergen to stop a reaction occurring \n  decongestants \u00a0\u2013 tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids that can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose \n lotions and creams, such as\u00a0moisturising creams (emollients)\u00a0\u2013 these can\u00a0reduce skin redness and itchiness \n  steroid medication \u00a0\u2013 sprays, drops, creams, inhalers and tablets that can help reduce redness and swelling caused by an allergic reaction \n \n For some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended. \n This involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn't react to it so severely. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating an allergy  and  avoiding allergic reactions . \n What causes allergies? \n Allergies\u00a0occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful. \n It's not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema. \n The number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it's the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with. \n It's thought this may\u00a0cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances.", "symptoms": "Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually develop within a few minutes of being exposed to something you're allergic to, although occasionally they can develop gradually over a few hours. \n Although\u00a0allergic reactions\u00a0can be a nuisance and hamper your normal activities, most are mild. Very occasionally, a severe reaction called  anaphylaxis  can occur. \n Main\u00a0allergy symptoms \n Common symptoms of an allergic reaction include: \n \n sneezing and an itchy, runny or blocked nose ( allergic rhinitis ) \n itchy, red, watering eyes ( conjunctivitis ) \n wheezing,\u00a0chest tightness,  shortness of breath \u00a0and a  cough  \n a raised, itchy, red rash ( hives ) \n  swollen\u00a0lips, tongue, eyes\u00a0or face  \n  tummy pain , feeling sick,  vomiting \u00a0or  diarrhoea  \n dry, red and cracked skin \n \n The symptoms vary depending on what you're allergic to and how you come into contact with it. For example, you\u00a0may\u00a0have a runny nose\u00a0if exposed to pollen, develop\u00a0a rash if you have a skin allergy, or feel sick\u00a0if you eat something you're allergic to. \n See your GP if you or your child might have had an allergic\u00a0reaction to something. They can help determine whether the symptoms are caused by an allergy or another condition. Read more about  diagnosing allergies . \n Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) \n In rare cases, an allergy can lead to a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening. \n This affects the whole body and usually\u00a0develops within minutes of exposure to something you're allergic to. \n Signs of anaphylaxis include any of the symptoms above, as well as: \n \n swelling of the throat and mouth \n difficulty breathing \n lightheadedness \n confusion \n blue skin or lips \n collapsing and losing consciousness \n \n Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.

In many cases, your GP will be able to offer advice and treatment. \n They'll advise you about taking steps to avoid exposure to the substance you're allergic to, and\u00a0can recommend medication to control your symptoms. \n Avoiding exposure to allergens \n The best way to keep your symptoms under control is often to avoid the things you're allergic to,\u00a0although this isn't always practical. \n For example, you\u00a0may be able to help\u00a0manage: \n \n  food allergies \u00a0by being careful about what you eat \n animal allergies by keeping pets outside as much as possible and washing them regularly \n mould allergies by\u00a0keeping your home dry and well-ventilated, and dealing with any damp and condensation \n  hay fever  by\u00a0staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas when the pollen count is high \n dust mite allergies by\u00a0using allergy-proof duvets and pillows, and fitting wooden floors rather than carpets \n \n Read more about  preventing allergic reactions . \n Allergy medications \n Medications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies without a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist or GP for advice before starting any new medicine, as they're not suitable for everyone. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines\u00a0are the main medicines for allergies. They\u00a0can be used: \n \n as and when you notice\u00a0the symptoms of\u00a0an allergic reaction \n to prevent allergic reactions\u00a0\u2013 for example, you may take them in the morning\u00a0if you have hay fever and you know the pollen count is high that day \n \n Antihistamines\u00a0can be taken\u00a0as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy. \n Decongestants \n  Decongestants \u00a0can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose caused by an allergic reaction. \n They\u00a0can be taken as tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids. Don't use them for more than a week at a time, as using them for long periods can make your symptoms worse. \n Lotions and creams \n Red and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as: \n \n emollients (moisturising creams)\u00a0to keep the skin moist and protect it from allergens \n calamine lotion to reduce itchiness \n steroids to reduce inflammation (see below) \n \n Steroids \n  Steroid medications \u00a0can help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction.\u00a0They're available as: \n \n nasal sprays and eye drops for an inflamed\u00a0nose and eyes \n creams for\u00a0 eczema  and\u00a0contact dermatitis \n inhalers for\u00a0 asthma  \n tablets for\u00a0 hives (urticaria)  \n \n Sprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription. Stronger creams,\u00a0inhalers and tablets are available on prescription from your GP. \n Immunotherapy (desensitisation)\u00a0 \n Immunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above. \n The treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen \u2013 either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue\u00a0\u2013 over the course of several years. \n The injection\u00a0can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be\u00a0taken at home. \n The aim of treatment is to help\u00a0your body get used to the allergen so it doesn't react to it so severely.\u00a0This won't necessarily cure\u00a0your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication. \n Treating severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) \n Some people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions,\u00a0known as\u00a0 anaphylaxis  or anaphylactic shock. \n If you're at risk of this, you'll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency. \n If you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help. \n Read more about the  treating anaphylaxis .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Allergic rhinitis", "introduction": "Allergic rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mould, or flakes of skin from certain animals. \n It's a very common condition, estimated to affect around one in every five people in the UK. \n Signs and symptoms \n Allergic rhinitis\u00a0typically\u00a0causes  cold-like symptoms , such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose. These symptoms usually\u00a0start soon after being\u00a0exposed to an allergen. \n Some people only\u00a0get allergic rhinitis\u00a0for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as\u00a0tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round. \n Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily and effectively treated. But for some symptoms can be severe and persistent, causing sleep problems and interfering with everyday life. \n The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and\u00a0it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely. \n When to see your GP \n Visit your GP if the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are disrupting your sleep, preventing you carrying out everyday activities, or adversely affecting your performance at work or school. \n A diagnosis of allergic rhinitis will usually be based on your symptoms and any possible triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for  allergy testing . \n Read more about  diagnosing allergic rhinitis  \n What causes allergic rhinitis? \n Allergic rhinitis is caused by the\u00a0immune system reacting to an allergen as if\u00a0it\u00a0were harmful. \n This\u00a0results\u00a0in\u00a0cells releasing a number of chemicals that cause\u00a0the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become swollen and excessive levels of mucus to be produced. \n Common\u00a0allergens that cause allergic rhinitis include pollen\u00a0\u2013 this type of allergic rhinitis is known as  hay fever \u00a0\u2013 as well as\u00a0mould spores, house dust mites, and\u00a0flakes of skin or droplets of urine or\u00a0saliva from certain\u00a0animals. \n Read more about the  causes of allergic rhinitis  \n Treating and preventing allergic rhinitis \n It's difficult to completely avoid potential allergens, but you can take steps to reduce exposure to a particular allergen you know or suspect is triggering your allergic rhinitis. This will help improve your symptoms. \n If\u00a0your condition is mild, you can also help reduce the symptoms by taking over-the-counter medications, such as non-sedating antihistamines, and by regularly rinsing your nasal passages with a salt water solution to keep your nose free of irritants. \n See your GP for advice if you've tried taking\u00a0these steps and they haven't helped. They may prescribe a stronger medication, such as a nasal spray containing  corticosteroids . \n Read more about  treating allergic rhinitis \u00a0and  preventing allergic rhinitis  \n Further problems \n Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include: \n \n nasal polyps \u2013 abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) sacs of fluid that grow inside the nasal passages and sinuses \n  sinusitis  \u2013 an infection caused by nasal inflammation and swelling that prevents mucus draining from the sinuses \n  middle ear infections  \u2013 infection of part of the ear located directly behind the eardrum \n \n These problems can often be treated with medication, although surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases. \n Read more about the  complications of allergic rhinitis", "symptoms": "", "causes": "Allergic rhinitis is caused by an allergic reaction to an allergen, such as pollen, dust and certain animals. \n Oversensitive immune system \n If you have allergic rhinitis, your immune system\u00a0\u2013 your natural defence against infection and illness\u00a0\u2013\u00a0will react to an allergen as if it were harmful. \n If your immune system is oversensitive, it will react to allergens by producing antibodies to fight them off. Antibodies are special proteins in the blood that are usually produced to fight viruses and infections. \n Allergic reactions don't occur the first time you come into contact with an allergen. The immune system has to recognise and \"memorise\" it before producing antibodies to fight\u00a0it. This process is\u00a0known as sensitisation. \n After you develop sensitivity to an allergen, it will be detected by antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE)\u00a0whenever\u00a0it comes into contact with the inside of your nose and throat. \n These antibodies cause cells to release a number of chemicals, including histamine, which can cause\u00a0the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become inflamed and produce excess mucus. This is what causes the typical symptoms of sneezing and a blocked or runny nose. \n Common allergens \n Allergic rhinitis is triggered by breathing in tiny particles of allergens. The most common airborne allergens that cause rhinitis are described below. \n House dust mites \n House dust mites are tiny insects that feed on the dead flakes of human skin. They can be found in mattresses, carpets, soft furniture, pillows and beds. \n Rhinitis isn't caused by the dust mites themselves, but by\u00a0a chemical found in their excrement. Dust mites\u00a0are present all year round, although their numbers tend to peak during the winter. \n Pollen and spores \n Tiny particles of pollen produced by trees and grasses can sometimes cause allergic rhinitis. Most trees pollinate\u00a0from early to mid-spring, whereas grasses pollinate at the end of spring and beginning of summer. \n Rhinitis can also be caused by spores produced by mould and fungi. \n Animals \n Many people are allergic to animals, such as cats and dogs. The allergic reaction isn't caused by animal fur, but flakes of dead animal skin and\u00a0their urine and saliva. \n Dogs and cats are the most common culprits, although some people are affected by horses, cattle, rabbits and rodents, such as guinea pigs and hamsters. \n However,\u00a0being around dogs from an early age can help protect against allergies, and there's some evidence to suggest that this might also be the case with cats. \n Work-related allergens \n Some people are affected by allergens found in their work environment, such as wood dust, flour dust or latex. \n Who's most at risk? \n It isn't fully understood why some people become oversensitive to allergens, although you're more likely to develop an allergy\u00a0if there's a history of allergies in your family. \n If this is the case, you're said to be \"atopic\", or to have \"atopy\". People who are atopic\u00a0have a genetic tendency to develop allergic conditions. Their increased immune response to allergens results in increased production of IgE antibodies.\u00a0 \n Environmental factors may also play a\u00a0part. Studies have shown certain things may\u00a0increase the chance of a child developing allergies, such as growing up in a house where people smoke and being exposed to\u00a0dust mites at a young age.", "treatment": "Treatment for allergic rhinitis depends on how severe your symptoms are and how much they're affecting your everyday activities. \n In most cases treatment aims to relieve symptoms such as sneezing and a blocked or runny nose. \n If you have mild allergic rhinitis, you can often treat the symptoms yourself.\u00a0 \n You should visit your GP if your symptoms are more severe and affecting your quality of life,\u00a0or if self-help measures haven't been effective. \n Self-help \n It's possible to treat the symptoms of mild allergic rhinitis with over-the-counter medications, such as long-acting, non-sedating antihistamines. \n If possible, try to reduce exposure to the allergen that triggers the condition. See  preventing allergic rhinitis  for more information and advice about this. \n Cleaning your nasal passages \n Regularly cleaning your nasal passages with a salt water solution\u00a0\u2013 known as nasal douching or irrigation\u00a0\u2013 can also help by keeping your nose free of irritants. \n You can do this either by using a homemade solution or a solution made with sachets of ingredients bought from a pharmacy. \n Small syringes or pots that often look like small horns or teapots are also available to help flush the solution around the inside of your nose. \n To make the solution at home, mix half a teaspoon of salt and\u00a0half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda (baking powder) into a pint (568ml) of boiled water that's been left to cool to around body temperature\u00a0\u2013\u00a0do not attempt to rinse your nose while the water is still hot. \n To rinse your nose: \n \n stand over a sink, cup the palm of one hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it \n sniff the water into one nostril at a time \n repeat this until your nose feels comfortable\u00a0\u2013 you may not need to use all of the solution \n \n While you do this, some solution may pass into your throat through the back of your nose. The solution is harmless if swallowed, but try to spit out as much of it as possible. \n Nasal irrigation can be carried out as often as necessary, but a fresh solution should be made each time. \n Medication \n Medication won't cure your allergy, but it can be used to treat the common symptoms. \n If your symptoms are caused by seasonal allergens, such as pollen, you should be able to stop taking your medication after the risk of exposure has passed. \n Visit\u00a0your GP if your symptoms don't respond to medication after two weeks. \n Antihistamines \n Antihistamines relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis by blocking the action of a chemical called histamine, which the body releases when it thinks it's under attack from an allergen. \n You can buy antihistamine tablets over the counter from your pharmacist without a prescription, but antihistamine nasal sprays are only available with a prescription. \n Antihistamines can sometimes\u00a0cause drowsiness. If you're taking them for the first time, see how you react to them before driving or operating heavy machinery. In particular, antihistamines can cause drowsiness if you drink alcohol while taking them. \n Corticosteroids \n If you have frequent or persistent\u00a0symptoms and you have a nasal blockage or nasal polyps, your GP may recommend a nasal spray or drops containing  corticosteroids . \n Corticosteroids help reduce inflammation and swelling. They take longer to work than antihistamines, but their effects last longer. Side effects from inhaled corticosteroids are rare, but can include nasal dryness, irritation and  nosebleeds . \n If you\u00a0have a particularly severe bout of symptoms and need rapid relief, your GP\u00a0may prescribe a short course of corticosteroid tablets lasting\u00a05 to 10 days. \n Add-on treatments \n If allergic rhinitis doesn't respond to treatment,\u00a0your GP\u00a0may choose to\u00a0add to your original treatment.\u00a0 \n They may\u00a0suggest: \n \n increasing the dose of your corticosteroid nasal spray \n using a short-term course of a decongestant nasal spray to take with your other medication \n combining antihistamine tablets with corticosteroid nasal sprays, and possibly decongestants \n using a nasal spray\u00a0that contains a medicine called ipratropium, which will help reduce excessive nasal discharge \n using a leukotriene receptor antagonist medication \u2013 medication that blocks the effects of chemicals called\u00a0leukotrienes, which are released during an allergic reaction \n \n If you don't respond to the add-on treatments, you may be referred to a specialist for further assessment and treatment. \n Immunotherapy \n Immunotherapy, also known as hyposensitisation or desensitisation,\u00a0is another type\u00a0of treatment used for some allergies. \n It's only suitable for people with certain types of allergies, such as  hay fever , and\u00a0is\u00a0usually only considered if your symptoms\u00a0are severe. \n Immunotherapy involves\u00a0gradually introducing more and more of the allergen into your body to make\u00a0your immune system\u00a0less sensitive to it. \n The allergen is\u00a0often injected under the skin of your upper arm. Injections are given at weekly intervals, with a slightly increased dose each time. \n Immunotherapy can also be carried out\u00a0using tablets that contain\u00a0an allergen, such as grass pollen, which\u00a0are\u00a0placed under your tongue. \n When a dose is reached that's effective\u00a0in reducing your allergic reaction (the maintenance dose), you'll need to continue with the injections or tablets for up to three\u00a0years. \n Immunotherapy should only be carried out under the close supervision of a specially trained doctor as there's a risk it may cause a serious allergic reaction.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Your GP will often be able to diagnose allergic rhinitis from your symptoms and your personal and family medical history. \n They'll ask you whether you've noticed\u00a0any triggers that seem to cause a reaction, and whether it happens at a particular place or time. \n Your GP may examine the inside of your nose to check for nasal polyps. \n Nasal polyps are fleshy swellings that grow from the lining of your nose or your sinuses, the small cavities inside your nose. They can be caused by the inflammation that occurs as a result of allergic rhinitis. \n Allergic rhinitis is usually confirmed when medical treatment starts. If you respond well to antihistamines, it's almost certain that your symptoms are caused by an allergy. \n Allergy testing \n If the exact cause of allergic rhinitis is uncertain, your GP may refer you to a hospital allergy clinic for allergy testing. \n The two main allergy tests are: \n \n skin prick test \u2013\u00a0where the allergen is placed on your arm and the surface of the skin\u00a0is pricked with a needle to\u00a0introduce the allergen to your immune system; if you're allergic to the substance,\u00a0a small itchy spot (welt) will appear \n blood test \u2013\u00a0to check for the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody in your blood; your immune system produces this antibody\u00a0in response to a suspected allergen \n \n Commercial allergy testing kits\u00a0aren't recommended because the testing is often of a lower standard than that provided by the NHS or an accredited private clinic. \n It's also\u00a0important that the test results are interpreted by a qualified healthcare professional with detailed knowledge of your symptoms and medical history. \n Further tests \n In some cases further\u00a0hospital tests may be needed to check for complications, such as nasal polyps or  sinusitis . \n For example, you may need: \n \n a nasal endoscopy\u00a0\u2013 where a\u00a0thin tube with a light source and video camera at one end (endoscope) is inserted up your nose so your doctor can see inside your nose \n a nasal inspiratory flow test \u2013 where a small device is placed over your mouth and nose to\u00a0measure the air flow when you inhale through your nose \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \u2013 a scan that uses\u00a0 X-rays  and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body"},

When this happens, symptoms can include: \n \n feeling sick \n weight loss \n loss of appetite \n yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) \n swelling in the ankles\u00a0and tummy \n confusion\u00a0or drowsiness \n vomiting blood or passing blood in your stools \n \n This means ARLD is frequently diagnosed during tests for other conditions, or at a stage of advanced liver damage. \n If you\u00a0regularly drink alcohol to excess, tell your GP so they can check if your liver is damaged. \n Read more about: \n \n  symptoms of ARLD  \n  diagnosing ARLD  \n \n Alcohol and the liver \n With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body.\u00a0Its functions include: \n \n filtering toxins from the blood \n aiding digestion of food \n regulating blood sugar and cholesterol levels \n helping fight infection and disease \n \n The liver is very resilient and capable of regenerating itself. Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. \n The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged\u00a0 alcohol misuse \u00a0(drinking too much)\u00a0over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can\u00a0result in serious and\u00a0permanent damage to your liver. \n ARLD is\u00a0very common in the UK\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades\u00a0as a result of\u00a0increasing levels of alcohol misuse. \n Read more about the\u00a0 causes of ARLD . \n Stages of ARLD \n There are 3\u00a0main stages of\u00a0ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage.\u00a0These stages are explained below. \n Alcoholic fatty liver disease \n Drinking a large amount\u00a0of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is\u00a0called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD. \n Fatty liver disease rarely causes any symptoms, but it's an important warning sign that you're drinking at a harmful level. \n Fatty liver disease is reversible. If you stop drinking alcohol for 2\u00a0weeks, your liver should return to normal. \n Alcoholic hepatitis \n Alcoholic\u00a0hepatitis\u00a0\u2013 which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol. \n Less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time  (binge drinking) . \n The liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently. \n Severe alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious\u00a0and life-threatening illness. Many people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage. \n Cirrhosis \n  Cirrhosis \u00a0is a stage of\u00a0ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred.\u00a0Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. \n It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy. \n A person who has\u00a0alcohol-related cirrhosis and doesn't stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5\u00a0more years. \n How ARLD is treated \n There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of\u00a0further damage to your liver and\u00a0gives\u00a0it the best chance of recovering. \n If\u00a0a person is\u00a0dependent on alcohol, stopping drinking can be very difficult. However, support, advice and medical treatment may be available through  local alcohol support services . \n A\u00a0 liver transplant  may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and doesn't improve when you stop drinking alcohol. \n You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you've developed complications of\u00a0 cirrhosis , despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require a person to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of\u00a0their life. \n Read more about\u00a0 treating ARLD . \n Complications \n Death rates linked to ARLD have\u00a0risen considerably over the last\u00a0few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with\u00a0 smoking  and  high blood pressure . \n Life-threatening complications of ARLD include: \n \n internal (variceal) bleeding \n build-up of toxins in the brain (encephalopathy) \n fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) with associated kidney failure \n  liver cancer  \n \n Read more about the  complications of ARLD . \n Preventing ARLD \n The most effective way to prevent\u00a0ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits: \n \n men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week \n spread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week \n \n A unit of alcohol is equal to about half a pint of normal-strength lager or a pub measure (25ml) of spirits. \n Even if you've been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits\u00a0for your liver and overall health. \n See our\u00a0 drinking and alcohol \u00a0pages for more information and advice.", "symptoms": "In many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) don't have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged. \n Early symptoms \n If you do experience early symptoms of ARLD, these\u00a0are often quite vague, such as: \n \n  abdominal (tummy) pain  \n loss of appetite \n  fatigue  \n feeling sick \n  diarrhoea  \n feeling generally unwell \n \n Advanced symptoms \n As\u00a0the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as: \n \n yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to\u00a0a build-up of fluid (oedema) \n swelling in your abdomen, due to\u00a0a build-up of fluid known as ascites \n a high temperature (fever)\u00a0and shivering attacks \n very itchy skin \n hair loss \n unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers) \n blotchy red\u00a0palms \n significant weight loss \n weakness and muscle wasting \n confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping ( insomnia ) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain \n vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to\u00a0internal bleeding \n a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent\u00a0 nosebleeds  and bleeding gums \n increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can't process them) \n \n When to seek medical advice \n ARLD\u00a0doesn't often cause symptoms until it's reached an advanced stage. If you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of the symptoms above. \n Read about  alcohol misuse (drinking too much) .\u00a0 \n Contact your GP for advice\u00a0if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse. \n A good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of 4\u00a0questions: \n \n Have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking? \n Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking? \n Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? \n Have you ever drunk an \"eye-opener\", which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves? \n \n If you answer \"yes\" to 1\u00a0or more of the questions above, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP. \n See your GP as soon as possible\u00a0if you have symptoms of advanced ARLD. \n Read more about  how ARLD is diagnosed .", "causes": "Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is caused by drinking too much alcohol. The more you drink above the recommended limits, the higher your risk of developing ARLD. \n There are 2\u00a0ways  alcohol misuse \u00a0(drinking too much)\u00a0can cause ARLD. These are: \n \n drinking a large amount of alcohol in a short amount of time  (binge drinking)  can cause fatty liver disease and, less commonly, alcoholic hepatitis \n drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol over many years can cause\u00a0hepatitis and  cirrhosis , the more serious types of ARLD \n \n Evidence suggests people who\u00a0regularly drink more than the recommended maximum amounts are most at risk of developing ARLD: \n \n men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week \n spread your drinking over 3\u00a0days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week \n \n Read more about  alcohol units and how to calculate them . \n Additional factors \n As well as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol, other factors can increase your chances of developing ARLD. These\u00a0include: \n \n being overweight or  obese  \n being female\u00a0\u2013\u00a0women appear to be more vulnerable than men to the harmful effects of alcohol \n having a pre-existing liver condition, such as\u00a0 hepatitis C \u00a0 \n genetics\u00a0\u2013\u00a0alcohol dependence and problems processing alcohol often run in families", "treatment": "Successful treatment for alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) often depends on whether someone is willing to stop drinking alcohol and make changes to their lifestyle. \n Stopping drinking\u00a0alcohol \n Treatment for\u00a0ARLD involves stopping drinking alcohol. This is known as abstinence, which can be vital, depending on what stage the condition is at. \n If you have fatty liver disease, the damage may be reversed if you abstain from alcohol for at least 2\u00a0weeks. After this point, it's usually safe to start drinking again if you stick to the\u00a0 NHS guidelines on alcohol consumption . \n If you have a more serious form of ARLD \u2013 alcoholic hepatitis\u00a0or  cirrhosis  \u2013 life-long abstinence is recommended.\u00a0This is because stopping drinking is the only way to prevent your liver damage getting worse and potentially stop you dying of liver disease. \n Stopping drinking isn't easy, especially as an estimated 70% of people with ARLD have an alcohol dependency problem. \n Nevertheless, if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis or alcoholic hepatitis and don't stop drinking, no medical or surgical treatment can prevent liver failure. \n Withdrawal symptoms \n If you're abstaining from alcohol, you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. These will be at their worst for the first 48 hours, but should start to improve as your body adjusts to being without alcohol. This usually takes 3\u00a0to 7\u00a0days from the time of your last drink. \n Many people initially experience\u00a0disturbed sleep when abstaining from alcohol, but\u00a0in most cases their sleep pattern returns to normal within a month. \n In some cases,\u00a0you may be advised to reduce your alcohol intake in a gradual and planned way to help avoid withdrawal problems. You may also be offered\u00a0a medication called a benzodiazepine and psychological therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), to help you through the withdrawal process. \n Some people\u00a0need to stay in hospital or a specialist rehabilitation clinic during the initial withdrawal phases, so\u00a0their\u00a0progress can be closely monitored. \n If you're\u00a0staying at home, you'll regularly see a nurse or other health professional. You might see them at home, at your GP surgery or at a specialist NHS service. \n Preventing relapses \n Once you've stopped\u00a0drinking, you may\u00a0need further\u00a0treatment to help ensure you don't\u00a0start drinking again. \n The first treatment usually offered\u00a0is psychological therapy. This involves\u00a0seeing a therapist to talk about your thoughts and feelings, and how these affect your behaviour and wellbeing. \n If psychological therapy alone isn't effective, you may also need medication to help you abstain from alcohol, such as:\u00a0 \n \n acamprosate \n naltrexone \n disulfiram \n \n Read our page on\u00a0 treating alcohol misuse \u00a0for\u00a0more information on the treatments offered. \n Self-help groups \n Many people with alcohol dependence find it useful to attend self-help groups to help them stop drinking. One of the most well-known is  Alcoholics Anonymous , but there are\u00a0many other groups that can help. \n See\u00a0 alcohol support \u00a0for more information about the help available. \n Diet and nutrition \n  Malnutrition \u00a0is common in people with ARLD, so it's important to eat a\u00a0 balanced diet  to help ensure you get all the nutrients you need. \n Avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to foods you eat can reduce your risk of developing swelling in your legs, feet and abdomen (tummy) caused by a build-up of fluid.\u00a0 \n The damage to your liver can also mean it's unable to store glycogen \u2013 a\u00a0carbohydrate that provides short-term energy. When this happens, the body uses its own muscle tissue to provide energy between meals, which leads to muscle wasting and weakness. Therefore, you may need extra energy and protein in your diet. \n Healthy snacking between meals can top up your calories and protein. It may also be helpful to eat 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0small meals a day, rather than 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0large meals. \n Your GP can advise you on a suitable diet or, in some cases, refer you to a dietitian. \n In the most serious cases of malnutrition, nutrients may need to be provided through a feeding tube\u00a0inserted through the nose and into the stomach. \n Medication\u00a0for\u00a0symptoms \n The use of medication to directly\u00a0treat\u00a0ARLD is controversial. Many experts have argued\u00a0there's limited evidence for its effectiveness. \n For people with severe alcoholic hepatitis, treatment in hospital may be necessary. Specific treatment with\u00a0corticosteroids\u00a0or pentoxifylline medication may be used to reduce inflammation of the liver in some people with this condition. \n Nutritional support (see above) is also an important part of treatment in these cases. \n Other medications that have been used to treat liver damage include: \n \n anabolic steroids (a more powerful type of steroid medication) \n ropylthiouracil (a type of medicine originally designed to treat  overactive thyroid glands ) \n \n However, there's a lack of good evidence that these help and they're no longer used for severe alcoholic hepatitis. \n Liver transplants \n In the most serious cases of ARLD, the liver loses its ability to function, leading to\u00a0liver failure. A\u00a0 liver transplant \u00a0is currently the only way to cure irreversible liver failure. \n A liver transplant may be considered if: \n \n you develop progressive liver failure, despite not drinking alcohol \n you're otherwise well enough to survive such an operation \n you commit to not drinking alcohol for the rest of your life", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is often first suspected when tests for other medical conditions show a damaged liver. \n This is because\u00a0the condition\u00a0causes few obvious symptoms in the early stages. \n If a doctor suspects ARLD, they'll usually arrange a blood test to check how well your liver is working. They may also ask about your alcohol consumption. \n It's important to be totally honest about how much and how often you drink alcohol to avoid further unnecessary testing. This could lead to a delay in the treatment you need. \n Blood tests \n  Blood tests \u00a0used to assess the liver are known as liver function tests. However, liver function tests can be normal\u00a0at many stages of liver disease. \n Blood tests can also detect if you have low levels of certain substances, such as a protein called serum albumin, which is made by the liver. A low level of serum albumin suggests your liver isn't functioning properly. \n A blood test may also look for signs of abnormal blood clotting, which can indicate significant liver damage. \n Lab Tests Online has more information on\u00a0 liver function tests . \n Further testing \n If your symptoms or liver function test suggest an advanced form of ARLD \u2013 either\u00a0alcoholic hepatitis or  cirrhosis  \u2013 you may need further tests. These are described below. \n Imaging tests \n Scans may be needed to\u00a0produce detailed images of your liver. This may include: \n \n an  ultrasound scan  \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \n a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \n \n Some scans may also measure the stiffness of the liver, which is a good indication of whether your liver is scarred. \n Liver biopsy \n During a liver\u00a0 biopsy ,\u00a0a\u00a0fine needle is inserted into your body (usually between your ribs). A small sample of liver cells is taken and sent to a laboratory to be examined under a microscope. \n The\u00a0biopsy is usually carried out under  local anaesthetic , either as a day case or with an overnight stay in hospital. \n Specialist doctors will examine the liver biopsy tissue under the microscope to determine the degree of scarring in the liver and the cause of the damage. \n Endoscopy \n An endoscope is a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and a video camera at one end.\u00a0During an endoscopy,\u00a0the instrument is\u00a0passed down your oesophagus (the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach) and into your stomach. \n Pictures of your oesophagus and stomach are transmitted to an external screen. The doctor will be looking for swollen veins (varices), which are a sign of cirrhosis."},

The risk to your health is increased\u00a0by drinking any amount of alcohol on a regular basis. \n Risks of alcohol misuse \n Short-term \n The short-term risks of alcohol misuse\u00a0include: \n \n accidents and injuries requiring hospital treatment, such as a  head injury  \n violent behaviour and being a victim of violence \n unprotected sex that could potentially lead to unplanned pregnancy or\u00a0 sexually transmitted infections (STIs)  \n loss of personal possessions, such as wallets, keys or mobile phones \n  alcohol poisoning \u00a0\u2013 this may lead to vomiting, seizures (fits) and falling\u00a0unconscious \n \n People who\u00a0 binge drink \u00a0(drink heavily over\u00a0a short period of time) are more likely to behave recklessly and are\u00a0at greater\u00a0risk of being in an accident. \n Long-term \n Persistent\u00a0alcohol misuse increases your risk of\u00a0serious health conditions, including: \n \n heart disease \n  stroke  \n  liver disease  \n  liver cancer  and  bowel cancer  \n  mouth cancer \u00a0 \n pancreatitis\u00a0 \n \n As well as causing serious health problems, long-term alcohol misuse can lead to social problems, such as unemployment, divorce,\u00a0domestic abuse and homelessness. \n If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism). \n Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this.\u00a0 \n Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in\u00a0amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill\u00a0some people. \n A dependent drinker usually\u00a0experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including: \n \n hand tremors\u00a0\u2013 \"the shakes\" \n sweating \n seeing things that aren't real (visual\u00a0hallucinations) \n  depression  \n anxiety \n difficulty sleeping  (insomnia)  \n \n This often leads to \"relief drinking\" to avoid withdrawal symptoms. \n Read more about the  risks of alcohol misuse  \n Am I drinking too much alcohol? \n You could be misusing alcohol if: \n \n you feel you should cut down on your drinking \n other people have been criticising your drinking \n you feel guilty or bad about your drinking \n you need a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover \n \n Someone you know may be misusing alcohol if: \n \n they\u00a0regularly exceed the\u00a0lower-risk daily\u00a0limit for alcohol \n they're sometimes\u00a0unable to remember what happened the night before because of their drinking \n they fail\u00a0to do what was expected of them as a result of\u00a0their drinking\u00a0\u2013 for example, missing an appointment or work\u00a0because of\u00a0being drunk or hungover \n \n Getting help \n If you're concerned about your drinking or someone else's, a good first step is to visit your GP. They'll be able to discuss the services and treatments available.\u00a0 \n Your alcohol intake\u00a0may be assessed using\u00a0tests, such as: \n \n the  Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (PDF, 224kb) \u00a0\u2013 a widely used screening test that can help determine whether you need to change your drinking habits \n the  Fast Alcohol Screening Test  \u2013 a simpler test\u00a0to check whether your drinking has reached dangerous levels \n the  Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire  \u2013 this helps identify\u00a0how severely dependent on alcohol you may be \n \n As well as the NHS, there are a number of charities and support groups across the UK\u00a0that provide support and advice for people with an alcohol misuse problem. \n For example, you may want to contact: \n \n  Alcohol Concern \u00a0\u2013 runs the national drink helpline, Drinkline on\u00a00300 123 1110 \n  Alcoholics Anonymous \u00a0\u2013 helpline 0845 769 7555 \n  Al-Anon Family Groups  \u2013 helpline 020 7403 0888 \n \n For a full list of charities and support groups, see\u00a0our page on  alcohol support  \n Treating alcohol misuse \n How alcohol misuse is treated depends on how much alcohol a person is drinking.

The first is to help stop withdrawal symptoms, and is given in reducing doses over a short period of time. The most common of these medicines is chlordiazapoxide (Librium). \n The second is a medication to reduce any urge you may have to drink. The most common medications used for this are acamprosate and naltrexone.

Drinking alcohol excessively can affect the quality of his sperm.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "The treatment options for alcohol misuse depend on the extent of your drinking and whether you're trying to drink less (moderation) or give up drinking completely (abstinence). \n This page covers: \n \n  brief intervention  \n  moderation vs abstinence  \n  detox and withdrawal symptoms  \n  medication for alcohol dependency  \n  therapy for alcohol dependency  \n \n   Alcohol Brief Intervention (ABI) \n An Alcohol Brief Intervention (ABI) is a short, evidence-based, structured conversation about alcohol consumption with a patient that\u2019s seeks in a non-confrontational way to motivate and support an individual to think about and/or plan a change in their drinking behaviour in order to reduce their consumption and/or their risk of harm\u2019. \n   Moderation vs abstinence \n Moderation\u00a0or abstinence\u00a0are\u00a0treatment options if you're: \n \n regularly drinking more than the lower-risk daily levels of alcohol \u2013 14 units\u00a0a week \n experiencing health problems directly related to alcohol \n unable to function without alcohol\u00a0(alcohol dependency) \n \n Cutting alcohol out completely will have a greater health benefit. However, moderation is often a more realistic goal, or at least a first step on the way to abstinence. \n Ultimately, the choice is yours, but\u00a0there are circumstances where abstinence is strongly recommended, including if you: \n \n have liver damage, such as\u00a0 liver disease  or  cirrhosis  \n have other medical problems,\u00a0such as heart disease,\u00a0that can be made worse by drinking \n are taking medication that can react badly with alcohol, such as antipsychotics \n are\u00a0pregnant or planning to become pregnant \n \n Abstinence may also be recommended if you've previously been unsuccessful with moderation. \n If you choose moderation, you'll probably be asked to attend further counselling sessions so your progress can be assessed, and further treatment and advice can be\u00a0provided if needed. \n You may also have regular\u00a0 blood tests  so the health of your liver can be carefully monitored. \n   Detox and withdrawal symptoms \n If you're dependent on alcohol to function, it's recommended\u00a0you seek medical advice to manage your withdrawal. \n Some people may be prescribed medication to help achieve abstinence. You may also choose to attend self-help groups, receive extended counselling, or use a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). \n Where detox is carried out \n How and where you attempt detoxification will be determined by your level of alcohol dependency. In mild cases, you should be able to detox at home without the use of medication\u00a0as your withdrawal symptoms should also be mild. \n If\u00a0your consumption of alcohol is high (more than\u00a020 units a day) or you've previously experienced withdrawal symptoms, you\u00a0may also be able to detox at home with medication to help ease withdrawal symptoms. A tranquiliser called\u00a0chlordiazepoxide is usually used for this purpose. \n If your dependency is severe, you may need to go to a hospital or clinic to detox. This is because the withdrawal symptoms will also be severe and are likely to need specialist treatment. \n Withdrawal symptoms \n Your withdrawal symptoms will be at their worst for the first 48 hours. They should gradually start to improve as your body begins to adjust to being without alcohol. This usually takes three to seven days from the time of your last drink. \n You'll also find\u00a0your sleep is disturbed. You may wake up several times during the night or have problems getting to sleep. This is to be expected, and your sleep patterns should return to normal within a month. \n During detox, make sure you\u00a0drink plenty of fluids (about three litres a day). However, avoid drinking large amounts of caffeinated drinks, including tea and coffee, because\u00a0they can make your sleep problems worse and cause feelings of anxiety. Water, squash or fruit juice are better choices. \n Try to eat regular meals, even if you're not feeling hungry. Your appetite will return gradually. \n Avoid\u00a0driving or operating heavy machinery if you're taking medication to help ease your withdrawal symptoms. It's likely\u00a0the medication will make you feel drowsy. Only take your medication as directed. \n Detox can be a stressful time. Ways you can try to relieve\u00a0stress\u00a0include reading, listening to music, going for a walk, and taking a bath. \n If you're detoxing at home, you'll regularly see a nurse or another healthcare professional. This might be at home, your GP practice, or a specialist NHS service. You'll also be given the relevant contact details for other support services should you need additional support. \n Withdrawal from alcohol is an important first step to overcoming your alcohol-related problems. However, withdrawal isn't an effective treatment by itself. You'll need further treatment and support to\u00a0help you\u00a0in the long term. \n   Medication for alcohol dependency \n The following medicines are licensed for the treatment of alcohol dependence and are available on NHS prescription in Scotland: \n \n acamprosate \n disulfiram \n naltrexone \n nalmefene \n \n These medications are discussed in more detail below. \n Acamprosate \n Acamprosate (brand name Campral) is used to help prevent a relapse in people who have successfully achieved abstinence from alcohol. It's usually used in combination with counselling to reduce alcohol craving. \n Acamprosate works by affecting levels of a chemical in the brain called gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). GABA is thought to be partly responsible for inducing a craving for alcohol. \n If you're prescribed acamprosate, the course usually starts as soon as you begin withdrawal from alcohol and can last for up to six months. \n Disulfiram \n Disulfiram (brand name Antabuse) can be used if you're trying to achieve abstinence but are concerned you may relapse, or if you've had previous relapses. \n Disulfiram works by deterring you from drinking by causing unpleasant physical reactions if you drink alcohol. These can include: \n \n nausea \n chest pain \n vomiting \n dizziness \n \n In addition to alcoholic drinks, it's important to avoid all sources of alcohol as they could also induce an unpleasant reaction. Products that may contain alcohol include: \n \n aftershave \n mouthwash \n some types of vinegar \n perfume \n \n You should also try to avoid substances that give off alcoholic fumes, such as paint thinners and solvents. \n You'll continue to experience unpleasant reactions if you come into contact with alcohol for a week after you finish taking disulfiram, so it's important to maintain your abstinence during this time. \n When taking disulfiram, you'll be seen by your healthcare team about once every two weeks for the first two months, and then every month for the following four months. \n Naltrexone \n Naltrexone can be used to prevent a relapse or limit the amount of alcohol someone drinks. \n It works by blocking opioid receptors in the body, stopping the effects of alcohol. It's usually used in combination with other medicine or counselling. \n If naltrexone is recommended, you should be made aware it also stops painkillers that contain opioids working, including morphine and codeine. \n If you feel unwell while taking naltrexone, stop taking it immediately and seek advice from your GP or care team. \n A course of naltrexone can last up to six months, although it may sometimes be longer. \n Before being prescribed any of these medications, you'll have a full medical assessment. \n Nalmefene \n Nalmefene (brand name Selincro) may be used to prevent a relapse or limit the amount of alcohol someone drinks. \n It works by blocking opioid receptors in the brain, which reduces cravings for alcohol. \n Nalmefene may be recommended as a possible treatment for alcohol dependence if you've had an initial assessment and: \n \n you're still drinking more than 7.5 units a day (for men) or more than 5 units a day (for women) \n you don't have any physical withdrawal symptoms \n you don't need to stop drinking immediately or achieve total abstinence \n \n Nalmefene should only be taken if you're receiving support to help you reduce your alcohol intake and continue treatment. \n   Therapy for alcohol dependency \n Self-help\u00a0groups \n Many people who have alcohol dependency problems find it useful to attend self-help groups, such as\u00a0 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) . \n One of the main beliefs behind AA is that alcoholic dependence is a long-term, progressive illness and total abstinence is the only solution. \n The treatment plan promoted by AA is based on a 12-step programme designed to help you overcome your addiction. \n The steps include admitting you're powerless over alcohol and your life has become unmanageable, admitting you've acted wrongly and, where possible,\u00a0making amends\u00a0with people you've harmed. \n Read more about the\u00a0 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous \u00a0and  alcohol support  \n Twelve-step facilitation therapy \n Twelve-step facilitation therapy is based on the programme devised by AA. The difference is you work through the stages on a one-to-one basis with a counsellor, rather than in\u00a0a group. \n The therapy may be your preferred treatment option if you feel uneasy or unwilling to discuss your problems in a group setting. \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) \n Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\u00a0is a\u00a0talking therapy that uses a problem-solving approach to alcohol dependence. \n The approach involves identifying unhelpful, unrealistic thoughts and beliefs that may be contributing towards your alcohol dependence, such as: \n \n \"I can't relax without alcohol\" \n \"My friends would find me boring if I was sober\" \n \"Just drinking one pint can't hurt\" \n \n Once these thoughts and beliefs are identified, you'll be encouraged to base your behaviour on more realistic and helpful thoughts, such as: \n \n \"Lots of people have a good time without alcohol, and I can be one of them\" \n \"My friends like me for my personality, not for my drinking\"\u00a0 \n \"I know I can't stop drinking once I start\" \n \n CBT also helps you identify triggers that can cause you to drink, such as: \n \n stress \n social anxiety \n being in \"high-risk\" environments, such as pubs, clubs and restaurants \n \n Your CBT therapist will teach you how to avoid certain triggers and cope effectively with those that are unavoidable. \n Family therapy \n Alcohol dependence doesn't just impact on an individual\u00a0\u2013\u00a0it can also affect a whole family. Family therapy provides family members with the opportunity to: \n \n learn about the nature of alcohol dependence \n support the member of the family who is trying to abstain from alcohol \n \n Support is also available for family members in their own right. Living with someone who misuses alcohol can be stressful, so\u00a0receiving support can often be very\u00a0helpful. \n There are a number of specialist alcohol services that\u00a0provide help and support for the relatives and friends of people with a dependence on alcohol. \n For example,\u00a0 Al-Anon \u00a0is an organisation affiliated with AA that\u00a0provides relatives\u00a0and friends with\u00a0help and support. Its confidential helpline number is 020 7403 0888 (10am to 10pm, 365 days a year).\u00a0 \n  Drinking diary  \n If you're aiming to moderate your drinking, you may be asked to keep a \"drinking diary\". \n On a daily basis, make a note of: \n \n all the alcoholic drinks you've had \n what time you had them \n where you were \n how many units you drank\u00a0\u2013 you can use the  Alcohol Concern unit calculator  to work this out \n \n This will give you a good idea\u00a0of how much alcohol you're drinking,\u00a0the situations in which you drink, and how you could start to cut down.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Addison's disease", "introduction": "Addison\u2019s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands. \n The adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce two essential hormones: cortisol and aldosterone. \n In Addison's disease, the adrenal gland is damaged, and not enough cortisol and aldosterone are produced. \n About 8,400 people in the UK have Addison's disease. It can affect people of any age, although it's most common between the ages of 30 and 50.\u00a0It's also more common in women than\u00a0men. \n Early-stage symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease are similar to other more common health conditions, such as\u00a0 depression  or  flu .\u00a0You may experience: \n \n fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) \n muscle weakness \n low mood \n loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss \n increased thirst \n \n Over time, these\u00a0problems may become more severe and you may experience further symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting,\u00a0cramps\u00a0and exhaustion. You may also develop small areas of darkened skin, or darkened lips or gums. \n Although these symptoms aren\u2019t always caused by Addison\u2019s disease, you should\u00a0see your GP, so they can be investigated. \n Read more about the  symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease \u00a0and  diagnosing Addison\u2019s disease  \n Why it happens \n The condition\u00a0is\u00a0usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70-90% of cases in the UK. \n Other potential causes include conditions that can damage the adrenal glands, such as\u00a0 tuberculosis (TB) , although this is uncommon in the UK. \n Read more about the  causes of Addison\u2019s disease  \n Treating Addison's disease \n Addison\u2019s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take the medication for the rest of your life. \n With treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and\u00a0are able to\u00a0live an active life, with few limitations. \n However,\u00a0many people with Addison's disease also find they must learn to manage\u00a0bouts of fatigue and there may be associated health conditions, such as\u00a0 diabetes  or an  underactive thyroid . \n People with Addison's disease must be constantly aware\u00a0of the risk of a sudden worsening of symptoms, called an adrenal crisis. This\u00a0can happen\u00a0when the levels of cortisol\u00a0in your body fall\u00a0significantly. \n An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you or someone you know has Addison\u2019s disease and is experiencing severe symptoms, dial 999 for an ambulance. \n Read more about  treating Addison's disease  \n Information about you \n If you have Addison's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \n This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. \n  Find out more about the register", "symptoms": "Addison's disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions. \n Initial symptoms of Addison's disease can\u00a0include: \n \n fatigue (lack of energy or motivation) \n lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness) \n muscle weakness \n low mood (mild  depression ) or irritability \n loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss \n the need to urinate frequently \n increased thirst \n craving for salty foods \n \n  Dehydration \u00a0can also be an early sign of Addison\u2019s disease. It's caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water. \n Later symptoms \n Further\u00a0symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. However,\u00a0additional strees, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse. \n You may go on to develop: \n \n  low blood pressure \u00a0when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting\u00a0 \n feeling sick (nausea) \n vomiting \n  diarrhoea  \n abdominal,\u00a0joint or back pain \n muscle cramps\u00a0 \n chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression \n brownish discolouration of the skin, lips\u00a0and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees \n a\u00a0 reduced libido (lack of interest in sex) , particularly in women \n \n Some women may also have irregular periods\u00a0or miss some periods completely.\u00a0Children with Addison's disease may experience puberty\u00a0later than usual. \n Some people with Addison's disease also develop  low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) . This can cause symptoms such as\u00a0difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children). \n If you're experiencing\u00a0symptoms of Addison's disease, see your GP so they can diagnose or rule out the condition.\u00a0These symptoms\u00a0will usually improve with\u00a0appropriate treatment. \n Read more about\u00a0 diagnosing Addison's disease  and  treating Addison's disease  \n Adrenal crisis \n If Addison\u2019s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland\u00a0gradually decrease in the body. This causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation\u00a0called\u00a0an adrenal or Addisonian crisis. \n During an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease appear quickly and\u00a0severely. This could happen when\u00a0you're already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all. \n Signs of an adrenal crisis include: \n \n severe  dehydration  \n pale, cold, clammy skin \n sweating \n rapid, shallow breathing \n dizziness \n severe vomiting and  diarrhoea  \n severe muscle weakness \n  headache  \n severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness \n \n An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know\u00a0with Addison\u2019s disease\u00a0is having an adrenal crisis, dial 999 for an ambulance. \n If an adrenal crisis isn't treated, it can lead to a\u00a0 coma  and death. There's also a risk your brain won't get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which\u00a0can cause permanent disability.", "causes": "Addison's disease develops when the outer layer of your adrenal glands (your adrenal cortex) is damaged, reducing the levels of hormones it produces. \n Problems with the immune system \n In the UK, a problem with the immune system is the most common cause of Addison's disease, accounting for 70-90% of cases. \n The\u00a0immune system is your body\u2019s defence against infection and disease. If you're ill, your immune system produces antibodies (a special type of protein that destroys disease-carrying organisms and toxins). These antibodies attack the cause of the illness. \n However, if you develop a problem with your immune system, it can start to attack your own healthy tissues and organs. This is known as an autoimmune disorder. \n Addison\u2019s disease can develop if your immune system attacks your adrenal glands and severely damages your adrenal cortex. When 90% of the adrenal cortex is destroyed, your adrenal glands won't be able to produce enough of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Once levels of these start decreasing, you'll experience  symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease . \n It's not clear why some people develop this problem with their immune system, although it can run in families (see below). \n Genetics \n Research has shown that some people with\u00a0certain genes\u00a0are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders. \n It's not clear how these genes lead to Addison's disease\u00a0and\u00a0similar conditions, but it does mean\u00a0your risk of developing Addison's disease is increased if you or a\u00a0close family member\u00a0have another autoimmune condition, such as: \n \n vitiligo\u2013 a chronic (long-term) condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin \n  type 1 diabetes  \u2013 a chronic condition caused by too much glucose in the blood\u00a0\u00a0 \n  underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) \u00a0 \n \n Other causes \n  Tuberculosis (TB) \u00a0is the most common cause of Addison's disease worldwide, but is rare in the UK. TB is a bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs, but can also spread to other parts of your body.\u00a0It can cause Addison\u2019s disease if it damages your adrenal glands. \n Other possible causes of Addison\u2019s disease include: \n \n infections \u2013 such as those linked to  AIDS , or fungal infections \n a haemorrhage \u2013 very heavy bleeding into the adrenal glands, sometimes associated with  meningitis \u00a0or other types of severe  sepsis  \n cancer \u2013 if\u00a0 cancer  cells from elsewhere in your body spread to your adrenal glands \n amyloidosis \u2013 a disease where amyloid, a protein produced by your bone marrow cells, builds up in your adrenal glands and damages them \n surgical removal of\u00a0both adrenal glands (adrenalectomy) \u2013 for example, to remove a tumour \n adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) \u2013 a rare, life-limiting, inherited condition affecting the adrenal glands and nerve cells in the brain that\u00a0most often\u00a0affects young boys \n certain treatments needed for Cushing's syndrome \u2013 a collection of symptoms caused by very high levels of cortisol in the body", "treatment": "If you have Addison\u2019s disease, you'll need to take daily medication to replace the lost hormones. This should help you to live an active life, although many people find they still need to manage their fatigue. \n In\u00a0some cases, the underlying causes of Addison\u2019s disease can be treated. For example,\u00a0 tuberculosis (TB)  is treated with a course of\u00a0 antibiotics  over a period of at least six months. \n However, most cases are caused by a problem with the immune system that can't be cured. \n Medication for\u00a0Addison\u2019s disease \n Treatment usually involves\u00a0 corticosteroid (steroid)  replacement therapy for life. Corticosteroid medication is used to replace the hormones cortisol and aldosterone that\u00a0your body no longer produces.\u00a0It's usually taken in tablet form two or three times a day. \n In most cases, a medication called\u00a0hydrocortisone\u00a0is used to replace the cortisol. Other possible medicines are\u00a0prednisolone or dexamethasone, though these are less commonly used.\u00a0 \n Aldosterone is replaced with a medication called fludrocortisone. Your GP may also ask you to add extra salt to your daily diet, although if you're taking enough fludrocortisone medicine this\u00a0may not be necessary.\u00a0Unlike most people, if you feel the urge to eat something salty, then you should eat it. \n In general, the medications used for Addison's disease don't have side effects, unless your dose is too high. If you take a higher dose than necessary for a long time, there's a risk of problems such as  weakened bones (osteoporosis) , mood swings and  difficulty sleeping (insomnia) . \n Living with Addison\u2019s disease \n Many people with Addison\u2019s disease find\u00a0that taking their medication enables them to continue\u00a0with their\u00a0normal diet and exercise routines. However, bouts of fatigue are also common, and it can\u00a0take some time to learn how to manage these periods of low energy. \n Some people find that needing to take regular doses of medication is restrictive and affects their daily life or emotional health.\u00a0Missing a dose of medication, or taking it late,\u00a0can also lead to exhaustion or insomnia. \n Some people can develop associated health conditions, such as\u00a0 diabetes  or an  underactive thyroid , which require extra treatment and management. \n You'll usually need to have appointments with an endocrinologist every 6-12 months, so they can review your progress and adjust your medication dose, if necessary.\u00a0Your GP can provide support and repeat prescriptions in between these visits. \n Failing to take your medication could lead to a serious condition called an adrenal crisis, so\u00a0you must: \n \n remember to collect your repeat prescriptions \n keep spare medication as necessary \u2013 for example, in the car or at work, and always carry some spare medication with you \n take your medication every day at the right time \n pack extra medication if you are going away \u2013 usually double what you would normally need, plus your injection kit (see below) \n carry your medication in your hand luggage if you are travelling by plane, with a note from your doctor explaining why it is necessary \n \n You could also inform close friends or colleagues of your condition. Tell them about the signs of adrenal crisis and what they should do if you experience one. \n Medical alert bracelets \n It's also a good idea to wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that informs people\u00a0you have Addison\u2019s disease. \n After a serious accident, such as a car crash, a healthy person produces more\u00a0cortisol. This helps you cope with the stressful situation and additional strain on your body that results from serious injury. As your body cannot produce cortisol, you'll need a hydrocortisone injection to replace it and prevent an adrenal crisis. \n Wearing a medical alert bracelet will inform any medical staff\u00a0treating you about your condition, and what medication you require. \n Medical alert bracelets or necklaces are pieces of jewellery engraved with your medical condition and an emergency contact number. They are available from a number of retailers. Ask your GP if there's one they recommend, or go to the\u00a0 MedicAlert  website.\u00a0 \n If you need to stay in hospital, the healthcare professionals responsible for your care will also need to know you need steroid replacement medication throughout your stay. It's important to note that this advice still applies if you're not supposed to eat or drink (nil by mouth) for any reason. \n Adjusting your medication \n At certain times, your medication may need to be adjusted to take into account any additional strain on your body. For example, you may need to increase the dosage of your medication if you experience any of the following: \n \n an illness or infection \u2013 particularly if you have a high temperature of 37.5C (99.5F) \n an accident, such as a car crash \n an operation, dental or medical procedure (such as a tooth filling or endoscopy) \n you're taking part in strenuous exercise\u00a0not usually part of your daily life \n \n This will help your body cope with the additional stress. Your endocrinologist will monitor your dosage and advise about any changes. Over time, as you get used to the condition and learn what can trigger your symptoms, you may learn how to adjust your medication yourself. However, always consult your GP or specialist if you're unsure. \n Emergency treatment \n You and a partner or family member may be trained to administer an injection of hydrocortisone in an emergency. \n This could be necessary if you go into shock\u00a0after an injury, or if you experience vomiting or diarrhoea and are unable to keep down oral medication. This may occur if you're pregnant and have  morning sickness . Your\u00a0endocrinologist will discuss with you when an injection might be necessary. \n If you need to administer emergency hydrocortisone, always call your GP immediately afterwards. Check what\u00a0 out-of-hours services  are available in your local area, in case the emergency is outside normal working hours. \n You can also\u00a0register yourself with your local  ambulance service , so they have a record of your requirement for a steroid injection or tablets, if you need their assistance. \n Treating adrenal crisis \n Adrenal crisis, or Addisonian crisis, needs urgent medical attention. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you or someone you know are experiencing adrenal crisis. \n Signs of an adrenal crisis include: \n \n severe  dehydration  \n pale, cold, clammy skin \n sweating \n rapid, shallow breathing \n dizziness \n severe vomiting and  diarrhoea  \n severe muscle weakness \n  headache  \n severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness \n \n In hospital, you'll be given lots of fluid through a vein in your arm to rehydrate you. This will contain a mixture of salts and sugars (sodium, glucose and dextrose) to replace those that your body is lacking. You'll also be injected with hydrocortisone to replace the missing cortisol hormone. \n Any underlying causes of the adrenal crisis, such as an infection, will also be treated.", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "To help diagnose Addison\u2019s disease, your GP will first ask about your symptoms and review your medical history. \n They're also likely to ask if anyone in your family has\u00a0an autoimmune disorder (a condition caused by a problem with their immune system). \n Your GP will examine your skin for any evidence of brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation), particularly in certain areas, such as: \n \n where skin creases on your palm \n in your elbow crease \n on any scars \n your lips and gums \n \n However, hyperpigmentation doesn't occur in all cases of Addison\u2019s disease. \n You'll also be tested for\u00a0 low blood pressure (hypotension)  while you're lying down and again shortly after you stand up. This is to see whether you have postural or orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when you change position). \n Blood tests \n If Addison\u2019s disease is suspected,\u00a0 blood tests  will be carried out to measure the levels of\u00a0sodium, potassium and cortisol\u00a0in your body. A low sodium, high potassium or low cortisol level may indicate\u00a0Addison\u2019s disease. \n You may need to see a hospital hormone specialist (endocrinologist) for your blood\u00a0to be tested for the following: \n \n a low level of the hormone aldosterone \n a high level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) \n a low level of glucose (sugar used for energy) \n positive adrenal antibodies (antibodies designed to attack the adrenal gland) \n \n Any of the above could be a sign of Addison\u2019s disease. \n Synacthen stimulation test \n If cortisol\u00a0in your blood\u00a0is\u00a0low, or your symptoms strongly suggest Addison\u2019s disease, you'll need to have a synacthen stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis. \n Your GP may refer you to an endocrinology unit (a unit that specialises in the study of hormones) for the test. How urgently you're referred depends on how severe your symptoms are. \n Synacthen is a man-made (synthetic) copy of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is naturally produced by the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland below the brain) to encourage the adrenal glands to release the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. \n When synacthen is administered, the adrenal glands should respond in the same way as they would to ACTH, and release cortisol and\u00a0other steroid hormones\u00a0into the blood. \n A blood sample will be taken and tested for cortisol, before an injection of\u00a0synacthen is given into your arm. After 30 and 60 minutes, a further\u00a0blood sample will be taken for cortisol measurement. \n If the ACTH level is high, but the cortisol and aldosterone levels are low, it's usually confirmation of Addison\u2019s disease. \n Thyroid function test \n As well as a synacthen stimulation test, your thyroid gland may also be tested to see if it's working properly. \n Your thyroid gland is found in your neck. It produces hormones that control your body's growth and metabolism. \n People with Addison\u2019s disease often have an\u00a0 underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) , where the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones. By testing the levels of certain hormones in your blood, your endocrinologist (a specialist in hormone conditions) can determine whether you have hypothyroidism. \n Scans \n In some cases, your\u00a0specialist may refer you for a scan of your adrenal glands \u2013 this could be a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan  or a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan . \n Diagnosis during an adrenal crisis \n If Addison\u2019s disease is left untreated, it eventually leads to an adrenal crisis. This is where\u00a0the\u00a0 symptoms of Addison\u2019s disease  appear quickly and severely. \n During an adrenal crisis, there's not enough time to perform a synacthen stimulation test to confirm Addison\u2019s disease. \n If possible, blood will be taken and tested for any of the abnormalities listed above. While you're waiting for the results, treatment may be started with steroid injections, and fluids containing salt and glucose. \n Read more about  treating\u00a0Addison\u2019s disease  \n Driving \n If you're diagnosed with Addison's disease and\u00a0have a bus, coach or lorry licence, it's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). \n Read\u00a0about\u00a0 driving and\u00a0Addison's disease \u00a0on the GOV.UK website."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Acute pancreatitis", "introduction": "Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage. \n Most people with\u00a0acute pancreatitis improve within a week and experience no further problems, but severe cases can have serious complications and can even be fatal. \n Acute pancreatitis is different to\u00a0 chronic pancreatitis , where the inflammation of the pancreas persists for many years. \n The most common symptoms of acute pancreatitis include: \n \n suddenly getting severe pain in the centre of your abdomen (tummy) \n feeling or being sick \n  diarrhoea  \n \n Read more about the\u00a0 symptoms of acute pancreatitis \u00a0and  diagnosing acute pancreatitis . \n When to seek medical help \n Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain.

However, 1\u00a0in 5\u00a0cases are severe and\u00a0can result in life-threatening complications, such as\u00a0multiple organ failure. \n In severe cases where\u00a0complications develop, there's a high\u00a0risk of\u00a0the condition\u00a0being fatal. In England, just over 1,000 people die from acute pancreatitis every year. \n If a person survives the effects of severe acute pancreatitis, it's likely to be several weeks or months before they're well enough to leave hospital. \n Read more about the possible\u00a0 complications of acute pancreatitis .", "symptoms": "The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly. \n This aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking\u00a0may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods. \n Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain. \n Acute pancreatitis caused by  gallstones \u00a0usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6-12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol. \n Other symptoms \n Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include: \n \n nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting \n  diarrhoea  \n  indigestion  \n a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n jaundice \u2013 yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes \n tenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy) \n \n When to seek medical advice \n Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn't possible,\u00a0contact\u00a0 NHS 24 111 Service  or your local\u00a0 out-of-hours service  for advice.", "causes": "Most cases of acute pancreatitis are closely linked to gallstones or to alcohol consumption, although the exact cause isn't always clear. \n Gallstones \n  Gallstones  are hard pieces of stone-like material that form in your gallbladder. They can trigger acute pancreatitis if they move out of the gallbladder and block the opening of the pancreas. \n The blockage can disrupt some of the enzymes (chemicals) produced by the pancreas. These enzymes are normally used to help digest food in your intestines, but they\u00a0can\u00a0start to digest the pancreas instead if\u00a0the opening is\u00a0blocked. \n However, not everyone with gallstones will develop acute pancreatitis. Most gallstones don't cause any problems. \n Alcohol consumption \n It's not fully understood how alcohol causes the pancreas to become inflamed. One theory is that it interferes with the normal workings of the pancreas, causing the enzymes to start digesting it. \n Whatever the cause, there is a clear link between alcohol use and acute pancreatitis. A very large study found that people who regularly drank more than 35  units of alcohol  a week were 4\u00a0times more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than people who never drank alcohol (35 units is the equivalent\u00a0of drinking around 16 cans of strong lager or 4\u00a0bottles of wine a week). \n  Binge drinking ,\u00a0which is drinking a lot of alcohol in a short period of time, is also thought to increase your risk of developing acute pancreatitis. \n Other causes \n Less common causes of acute pancreatitis include: \n \n accidental damage or injury to the pancreas \u2013 for example, during\u00a0a procedure\u00a0to\u00a0 remove gallstones  or examine the pancreas \n certain types of medication,\u00a0such as some  antibiotics  or  chemotherapy  medication \u2013 acute pancreatitis can be\u00a0an unexpected side effect of these in a small number of people \n a viral infection \u2013 such as  mumps \u00a0or  measles  \n a complication of  cystic fibrosis  \n certain rare conditions \u2013 including hyperparathyroidism, Reye's syndrome\u00a0and Kawasaki disease \n \n Severe pancreatitis \n Little is known about why some people develop severe acute pancreatitis. Factors thought to increase your risk include: \n \n being 70 years of age or over \n being  obese \u00a0(a person is considered obese if they have a\u00a0 body mass index (BMI)  of 30 or above) \n having 2\u00a0or more alcoholic drinks a day \n smoking \n \n Researchers have also discovered that people with a specific genetic mutation, known as the MCP-1 mutation, are 8\u00a0times more likely to develop severe acute pancreatitis than the general population. A genetic mutation is where the instructions (DNA) found in all living cells become scrambled, resulting in a genetic disorder or a change in characteristics.", "treatment": "Acute pancreatitis is treated in hospital, where you'll be closely monitored for signs of serious problems and given supportive treatment, such as fluids and oxygen. \n Many people are well enough to leave hospital after 5-10 days. \n In severe cases, complications can develop that require specific additional treatment and you'll need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or intensive care unit (ICU). In these cases, recovery\u00a0may take much longer, and the condition can be fatal. \n Read about the potential\u00a0 complications of acute pancreatitis  for more information\u00a0on severe cases. \n Fluids \n Your body can become dehydrated during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids are provided through a tube connected to one of your veins (this is known as intravenous, or IV, fluid). \n In severe cases of acute pancreatitis, IV fluids can help to prevent a serious problem called hypovolemic shock, which occurs when a drop in your fluid levels lowers the amount of blood in your body. \n Nutritional support \n Although the diet of many people with mild acute pancreatitis isn't restricted, some\u00a0people are advised not to\u00a0eat. This is because trying to digest solid food could place too much strain on your pancreas. \n Depending on the severity of the condition, you may not be able to eat solid foods\u00a0for a few days or longer. \n If you\u00a0need to avoid solid food, a feeding tube may be\u00a0used to provide your body with nutrients. This is known as enteral feeding and\u00a0often involves using\u00a0a tube inserted into your stomach through your nose (nasogastric tube). \n Oxygen \n To ensure your vital organs have enough oxygen, it will usually be supplied through tubes into your nose. The tubes can be removed after a few days, once your condition is improving. \n In severe cases, ventilation equipment may also be used to assist with your breathing. \n Painkillers \n Acute pancreatitis often causes severe abdominal (tummy) pain, so strong painkilling medication will probably be required, such as morphine.\u00a0 \n Some of the painkillers used can make you feel very drowsy. If you're visiting someone who is in hospital with acute pancreatitis, don't be alarmed or concerned if they appear drowsy or unresponsive. \n Treating the underlying cause \n Once\u00a0the condition is under control, the underlying cause may need to be treated. Treatments for the most common  causes of acute pancreatitis  \u2013 gallstones and alcohol consumption \u2013 are outlined below. \n Gallstones \n If a\u00a0 gallstone  is responsible for the pancreatitis,\u00a0you may need\u00a0a procedure called\u00a0endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),\u00a0or your gallbladder may need to be removed. \n  Gallbladder removal surgery \u00a0may be done while you're in hospital, or it\u00a0may be planned for several weeks' time. Having your gallbladder removed should have no significant effect on your health, other than making it more difficult to digest certain foods, such as fatty or spicy foods. \n An ERCP procedure is an alternative treatment for gallstones. It involves using a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. \n  X-rays \u00a0guide the endoscope into your digestive system, and\u00a0surgical instruments\u00a0are passed\u00a0down the endoscope\u00a0to remove\u00a0the gallstones. \n Alcohol consumption \n After recovering from acute pancreatitis, alcohol should be completely avoided\u00a0if this was the cause of the condition. If you find this difficult, you'll probably need additional treatment. \n Treatment options for alcohol dependence include: \n \n one-to-one\u00a0counselling \n self-help groups \u2013 such as  Alcoholics Anonymous  \n a medication called acamprosate \u2013 which helps to reduce your alcohol cravings \n \n Read more about\u00a0 treating alcohol misuse .", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "Most cases of acute pancreatitis are diagnosed in hospital because of the risk of serious complications. \n The doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. They may also carry out a physical examination. If you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch. \n A  blood test  will be carried out to help confirm a diagnosis. This\u00a0can detect signs of acute pancreatitis,\u00a0such as\u00a0a high level of 2\u00a0chemicals called lipase and amylase. \n At first, it can be difficult to tell whether your acute pancreatitis is mild or severe. You'll be monitored closely for signs of serious problems, such as organ failure. \n People with mild acute pancreatitis tend to improve within a week and experience either no further problems or problems that resolve within 48 hours. People with severe acute pancreatitis develop persistent serious problems. \n Further testing \n Several tests may be used to help determine the severity of your condition and\u00a0assess your risk of developing more serious complications. \n You may have any of the following tests: \n \n a  computerised tomography (CT) scan  \u2013 where a series of X-rays are taken to build up a more detailed, three-dimensional image of your pancreas \n a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013 where strong magnetic fields and radio waves are used to produce a detailed image of the inside of your body \n  an ultrasound scan  \u2013 where high-frequency sound waves are used to create an image of part of the inside of the body \n endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) \n \n An ERCP uses a narrow, flexible tube known as an endoscope, which has a camera on one end. The endoscope will be passed through your mouth and towards your stomach. A special dye that shows up on\u00a0 X-rays  is then injected through the endoscope into your bile and pancreatic ducts. After the dye has been injected, X-rays will be taken. \n This test can be useful in cases of gallbladder-associated acute pancreatitis, because it can pinpoint exactly where the gallstone is located. In some cases, it may be possible to pass surgical instruments down the endoscope, so the gallstone can be removed."},

The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia . \n For information about AML in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0 AML  section. \n Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control. \n Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to: \n \n help us fight infection (white cells) \n carry oxygen from the lungs around our body (red blood cells) \n stop us bleeding when we cut ourselves by clotting our blood (platelets). \n \n Symptoms \n Many of the symptoms of AML are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include: \n \n looking paler than usual and feeling tired - because of too few red blood cells (anaemia) \n bruises or bleeding - you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal \n infections - because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection \n aches and pains in your bones \n swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin \n feeling unwell and run down \n fever and sweats - you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection \n headaches and blurred vision - because of too many white blood cells \n breathlessness\u00a0- because of too many white blood cells. \n \n Causes \n We don't know exactly what causes AML, but research is going on to try to find out. We do know some things might increase the risk of AML: \n \n Some genetic conditions, like Down's Syndrome. A genetic condition is something you are born with. \n Some non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. \n \n If you're worried about AML \n If you think you might have any of the symptoms of AML, you should go to your GP.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Acute myeloid leukaemia: Children", "introduction": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. A third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia, with approximately 400 new cases occurring each year in the UK. Less than a quarter of these are acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML can affect children of any age; girls and boys are equally affected. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Leukaemia \n Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some of the bones in the body. \n Bone marrow contains: \n \n red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body \n platelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding \n white blood cells, which help to fight infection \n \n There are two different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature. \n These immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection. \n There are four main types of leukaemia: \n \n acute lymphoblastic (ALL) \n acute myeloid (AML) \n chronic lymphocytic (CLL) \n chronic myeloid (CML) \n \n Chronic leukaemias occur mostly in adults. CLL is exclusively an adult condition, whereas CML does occur rarely in children and young people. Each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment. \n This is about acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). \n Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) \n Acute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells). \n Cells that have started to show some of the features of myeloid cells are said to show differentiation. Cells that do not show signs of becoming a particular type of white blood cell are known as undifferentiated. \n There are different sub-types of AML, depending upon exactly which type of cell has become leukaemic, the stage of development (maturation) the cells are at and whether the cells are differentiated. Knowing the sub-type of AML is important, as it helps doctors decide on the best treatment.\u00a0 \n There are several classification systems for the sub-types of AML. The most commonly used system in the UK is the French-American-British (FAB) system. \n  FAB classification of AML  \n \n M0 - AML with minimal evidence of myeloid differentiation \n M1 - AML without maturation \n M2 - AML with maturation \n M3 - Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) \n M4 - Acute myelomonocytic leukaemia \n M5 - Acute monocytic/monoblastic leukaemia \n M6 - Acute erythroleukaemia \n M7 - Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia \n \n A newer system known as the WHO (World Health Organization) classification system is also sometimes used. \n Causes \n The exact cause of AML is unknown. Research into possible causes of this disease is ongoing. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as Down\u2019s syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with AML have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. Other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), may increase a child\u2019s risk of developing AML. \n AML, like all types of cancer, is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people. \n Signs and symptoms \n As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells. \n Children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood. Sometimes they may suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells. \n A child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands. \n At first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear. \n How AML is diagnosed \n A blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The bone marrow sample is also examined to check for any abnormalities in the chromosomes of the leukaemia cells. \n A test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest x-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child\u2019s symptoms. \n These tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia, and help doctors to decide on the best treatment. \n Treatment \n The aim of treatment for AML is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. Usually a combination of chemotherapy drugs is given, according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen). \n The treatment usually has different phases, explained below: \n  Induction  \n This phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible. It usually involves two courses (cycles) of a combination of chemotherapy drugs. \n A bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. When there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child\u2019s condition is referred to as being in remission. \n  Post-remission treatment  \n When there are no signs of the leukaemia in the blood or bone marrow, further treatment is often given. This phase of the treatment aims to destroy any leukaemia cells that may be left and to help stop the AML from coming back. This treatment usually involves two more courses of chemotherapy. \n  Bone marrow transplant  \n This treatment is usually only used for children with AML that is likely to come back or has come back (recurred) following standard chemotherapy. \n  Central nervous system (CNS) treatment  \n AML may sometimes develop in the brain and spinal cord. This can be prevented by injecting chemotherapy drugs directly into the spinal fluid during a lumbar puncture (intrathecal chemotherapy). Intrathecal chemotherapy is usually given after each of the first two courses of chemotherapy. Sometimes a more intensive treatment is needed, and the intrathecal drugs are given more frequently until all the regular chemotherapy has been completed. Occasionally, radiotherapy to the brain is also necessary. \n Side effects of treatment \n Many cancer treatments will cause  side effects . This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells. \n Some of the main side effects are: \n \n  hair loss  \n reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (an increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection) \n loss of appetite and weight \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n \n Most side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about side effects. \n Late side effects of treatment \n A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way the heart works, and a small increase in the risk of developing a second cancer in later life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for AML. If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is often provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given plenty of time to decide if it\u2019s right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child\u2019s cancer. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the cancer is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The  Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group  (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Many children with AML are cured. If the leukaemia comes back after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first three years. Most children with AML grow and develop normally. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address\u00a0here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Acute myeloid leukaemia", "introduction": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment. \n Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. The two main types of white blood cells are: \n \n lymphocytes \u2013 mostly used to fight viral infections \n myeloid cells \u2013 which perform a number of different functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending\u00a0the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\u00a0 \n \n This topic focuses on acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which is an aggressive\u00a0cancer of the myeloid cells. The following types of leukaemia are covered separately: \n \n  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \n  chronic myeloid leukaemia  \n  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  \n \n Signs and symptoms of AML \n The\u00a0 symptoms of AML  usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include: \n \n pale skin \n tiredness \n  breathlessness  \n frequent infections \n unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or  nosebleeds  \n \n In more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding. \n Read more about the  complications of AML  \n Seeking medical advice \n You should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms\u00a0of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause,\u00a0these symptoms should be investigated. \n If your GP thinks you may have leukaemia, they'll arrange  blood tests  to check your blood cell production. If the tests suggest there's a problem, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions) for further tests and any necessary treatment. \n Read more about  diagnosing AML  \n What causes AML? \n AML\u00a0occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones),\u00a0produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells. \n Blast cells don't have the infection-fighting properties of healthy white blood cells, and producing too many can\u00a0lead to a\u00a0decrease in the number of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) and platelets (cells that help the blood to clot). \n It's not clear exactly why this happens and, in most cases, there's no identifiable cause. However,\u00a0a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing AML have been identified. These include: \n \n previous\u00a0 chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy  \n exposure to very high levels of radiation\u00a0(including previous\u00a0 radiotherapy\u00a0treatment) \n exposure to benzene \u2013 a chemical used in manufacturing that's also found in cigarette smoke \n having an underlying blood disorder or genetic disorder, such as  Down's syndrome  \n \n Read more about the  causes of AML  \n Who's affected \n AML\u00a0is a rare type of cancer, with around 2,600 people diagnosed with it\u00a0each year in the UK. \n The risk of developing AML increases with\u00a0age. It's\u00a0most common in people over 65. \n How AML is treated \n AML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed. \n  Chemotherapy \u00a0is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing). \n In some cases, intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be needed, in combination with a\u00a0 bone marrow or stem cell transplant , to achieve a cure. \n Read more about  treating AML  \n Outlook \n The outlook for AML largely depends on the specific\u00a0type of AML you have,\u00a0as well as your\u00a0age and general health. \n There are many subtypes of AML, which are classified according to various features \u2013 such as the specific genetic changes in the leukaemia cells. Some types of AML\u00a0are more challenging to treat than others. \n Even if treatment is initially successful, there's still a significant risk that the condition will return at some point during the next few years. If this happens, treatment may need to be repeated. \n A number of medical trials have suggested that almost half of those aged under 60 diagnosed with AML will live for at least five years, and in some types of AML, such as acute promyeloid leukaemia (APML), around 85% will live for at least five years. \n In general, the outlook for children with AML tends to be better than that of adults diagnosed with the condition.", "symptoms": "The symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) usually develop over a few weeks, becoming more severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases. \n Symptoms of AML can\u00a0include: \n \n pale skin \n tiredness \n  breathlessness  \n a high temperature (fever) \n excessive sweating \n weight loss \n frequent infections \n unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or  nosebleeds  \n easily bruised skin \n flat\u00a0red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae) \n bone and joint pain \n a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleen \n \n In\u00a0rare cases of AML, the affected cells can spread into the central nervous system. This can cause symptoms such as  headaches , fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness. \n When to seek medical advice \n See your GP if you or your child have the symptoms listed above. Although it's highly unlikely that AML is the cause, these symptoms need to be investigated and treated\u00a0promptly.", "causes": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells in your bone marrow that produce red blood cells, platelets and infection-fighting white blood cells. \n The mutation\u00a0causes the stem cells\u00a0to produce many more white blood cells than are needed. \n The white blood cells produced are still immature, so they don't have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. These immature cells are known as \"blast cells\". \n As the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it's this fall that causes many of the  symptoms of leukaemia . \n Increased risk \n It's not known what triggers the genetic mutation\u00a0in AML, although a number of different factors that\u00a0can increase your risk of developing the condition have been identified. \n The main risk factors for AML are\u00a0outlined below. \n Radiation exposure \n Being exposed to\u00a0a significant level of radiation\u00a0can increase your chances of developing AML, although this usually requires exposure\u00a0at very high levels. For example, rates of AML are higher in people who survived\u00a0the atomic bomb explosions in Japan in 1945. \n In the UK, most people\u00a0are unlikely to be exposed to levels of radiation high enough to cause AML.\u00a0However, some people who have had  radiotherapy  as part of their treatment for previous cancer (see below) can be the exception. \n Benzene and smoking \n Exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for AML in adults. Benzene is found in petrol, and it's also used in the rubber industry, although there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure. \n Benzene is also found in cigarette smoke, which could explain why people who smoke have an increased risk of developing AML. \n Previous cancer treatment \n Treatment with radiotherapy and certain  chemotherapy  medications for\u00a0an earlier, unrelated cancer can increase your risk of developing AML many years later. \n Leukaemia that develops as a result of previous cancer treatment is called \"secondary leukaemia\" or \"treatment-related leukaemia\". \n Blood disorders \n People with certain blood disorders \u2013 such as myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis or\u00a0 polycythaemia  vera (PCV) \u2013 have an increased risk of developing AML. \n Genetic disorders \n People with certain genetic disorders, including  Down\u2019s syndrome  and Fanconi\u2019s anaemia, have an increased risk of developing leukaemia. \n Other suggested triggers \n A number of other environmental factors that could trigger AML have also been suggested, including childhood vaccinations and living near a nuclear power station or a high-voltage power line. However, there's no clear\u00a0evidence to suggest that these can increase your risk of developing AML.", "treatment": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive condition that develops rapidly, so treatment will usually begin a few days after a diagnosis has been confirmed. \n As AML is a complex condition, it's usually treated by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) \u2013 a group of different specialists working together (see below). \n Your treatment plan \n Treatment for AML is often carried out in two stages: \n \n Induction \u2013 the aim of this initial stage of treatment is to kill as many leukaemia cells in your blood and bone marrow as possible, restore your blood to proper working order and treat any symptoms you may have. \n Consolidation \u2013 this stage aims to prevent the cancer returning (relapsing), by killing any remaining leukaemia cells that may be present in your body. \n \n The induction stage of treatment isn't always successful and sometimes needs to be repeated before consolidation can begin. \n If you have a relapse after treatment, both re-induction and consolidation may need to be carried out. This may be the same as your first treatment, although it's likely to involve different medications or a stem cell transplant (see below). \n If you're thought to have a high risk of experiencing  complications of AML treatment  \u2013 for example, if you're over 75 years of age or have another underlying health condition \u2013 less intensive chemotherapy treatment may be carried out. This is less likely to successfully kill all of the cancerous cells in your body, but it can help control your condition.\u00a0 \n Induction \n The initial treatment you have for AML will largely depend on whether you're fit enough to have intensive\u00a0 chemotherapy , or whether treatment at a lower dosage is recommended. \n Intensive chemotherapy \n If you can have intensive induction chemotherapy, you'll usually be given a combination of chemotherapy medication at a high dose to kill the cancerous cells in your blood and bone marrow. \n This stage of treatment will be carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre, as you'll need very close medical and nursing supervision. \n You'll have regular\u00a0 blood transfusions \u00a0because your blood won't contain enough healthy blood cells. \n You'll also be vulnerable to infection, so it's important that you're in a clean and stable environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed\u00a0antibiotics to help prevent further infection. \n Depending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from four weeks to a couple of months. You may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve. \n For intensive treatment, the chemotherapy medications will be injected into a thin tube that's inserted either into a blood vessel near your heart (central line) or into your arm (a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC). \n In very rare cases, chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This is done using a needle that's placed into your spine, in a similar way to a\u00a0 lumbar puncture . \n Side effects of intensive chemotherapy for AML are common. They can include:\u00a0 \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n  diarrhoea  \n loss of appetite \n sore mouth and  mouth ulcers  (mucositis) \n tiredness \n skin rashes \n  hair loss  \n  infertility  \u2013 which may be temporary or permanent (see  complications of AML  for more information) \n \n Most side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Tell a member of your care team if side effects become particularly troublesome, as there are medicines that can help you cope better with certain side effects. \n Read more about the  side effects of chemotherapy  \n Non-intensive chemotherapy \n If your doctors don\u2019t think you're fit enough to withstand the effects of intensive chemotherapy, they may recommend non-intensive treatment. This involves using an alternative type of chemotherapy to the standard intensive therapy, which\u00a0is designed more to control leukaemia rather than cure it. \n The main aim of this treatment is to control the level of cancerous cells in your body and limit any symptoms you have, while reducing your risk of experiencing significant side effects of treatment. \n The medications used during non-intensive chemotherapy may be given through a drip into a vein, by mouth or by injection under the skin, and can often be given on an outpatient basis. \n All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA) \n If you have the sub-type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, you'll usually be given capsules of a medicine called ATRA, in addition to chemotherapy. \n ATRA works by changing the immature white blood cells (blast cells) into mature healthy cells, and can reduce symptoms very quickly. \n Side effects of ATRA can include  headaches , nausea, bone pain, and  dry mouth , skin and eyes. \n Consolidation \n If induction is successful, the next stage of treatment will be consolidation. \n This often involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication that are usually given on an outpatient basis, which means that you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may need some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection. \n The consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months. \n Other treatments \n Many other treatments are used for AML, as\u00a0described below.\u00a0 \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0involves using high doses of controlled radiation\u00a0to kill cancerous cells. There are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat AML: \n \n to prepare the body for a bone marrow or stem cell transplant (see below) \n to treat advanced cases that have spread to the nervous system and/or brain, although this is uncommon \n \n  Side effects of radiotherapy \u00a0can include hair loss, nausea and fatigue. The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. \n Bone marrow and stem cell transplants \n If chemotherapy doesn't work, a possible alternative treatment option is a  bone marrow or stem cell transplant . \n Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have\u00a0intensive high-dose chemotherapy and possibly radiotherapy to destroy the cells in their bone marrow. The donated stem cells are given through a tube into a blood vessel, in a similar way to chemotherapy medication. \n This process can put an enormous amount of strain on the body and cause significant side effects and potential complications, so you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few weeks. \n Transplantations have better outcomes if the donor has the same tissue type as the person receiving the donation. The best candidate to provide a donation is usually a brother or sister with the same tissue type. \n Transplantations are most successful when they're carried out on children and young people, or older people who are otherwise in good health, and when there's a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister. \n Read\u00a0about\u00a0 bone marrow donation  \n Azacitidine \n Azacitidine is a possible alternative treatment for adults with AML who can't have a stem cell transplant. \n It's recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use\u00a0in certain circumstances\u00a0\u2013 for example, depending on the characteristics of the person's blood and bone marrow. \n Azacitidine is a chemotherapy medication that's given by injection under the skin. It interferes with the growth of cancer cells and destroys them, and also helps bone marrow to produce normal blood cells. \n NICE has\u00a0more information about  azacitidine for the treatment of AML  \n Clinical trials and\u00a0newer unlicensed treatments \n In the UK, a number of clinical trials\u00a0are currently underway that aim to find the best way of treating AML. Clinical trials are studies that use new and experimental techniques to see how well they work in treating, and possibly curing, AML. \n As part of your treatment, your care team may suggest taking part in a clinical trial to help researchers learn more about the best way to treat your\u00a0AML, and AML in general. Search for  clinical trials for AML . \n If you take part in a clinical trial, you may be offered medication that isn't licensed for use in the UK and isn't normally available. However, there's no guarantee that the techniques being studied in the clinical trial will work better than current treatments. \n Your care team can tell you whether there are any clinical trials available in your area, and can explain the benefits and risks involved. \n Macmillan has more information about  unlicensed treatments for AML", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "In the initial stages of diagnosing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), your GP will check for physical signs of the condition and arrange for you to have  blood tests . \n A high number of abnormal white blood cells, or a very low blood count in the test sample, could indicate the presence of leukaemia. If this is the case, you'll be urgently referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions). \n A haematologist may carry out further blood tests, in addition to some of the tests outlined below. \n Bone marrow biopsy \n To confirm a diagnosis of AML, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. This procedure is known as a bone marrow biopsy, which is usually carried out under a  local anaesthetic . \n The haematologist will numb an area of skin at the back of your hip bone, before using a thin needle to remove a sample of liquid bone marrow. In some cases, a larger needle may also be used to remove a small amount of bone and bone marrow together. \n You won't feel any pain during the procedure, but you may experience some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete, and you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. \n The bone marrow sample will be checked for cancerous cells. If cancerous cells are present, the biopsy can also be used to determine the type of leukaemia you have. \n Further tests \n Additional tests can be used to reveal more information about the progress and extent of your AML. They can also provide an insight into how the condition should be treated. These tests are described below. \n Genetic testing \n Genetic tests can be carried out on blood and bone marrow samples to identify the genetic makeup of the cancerous cells. There are many specific genetic variations that can occur in AML, and knowing the exact type of AML you have can help doctors make decisions about the most appropriate treatment. \n For example, people who have a type of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML) are known to respond well to a medicine called All Trans-Retinoic Acid (ATRA). \n Scans \n If you have AML, a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan ,\u00a0 X-ray  or echocardiogram (an\u00a0 ultrasound  scan of the heart) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy. \n These tests are carried out because it's important for doctors to assess your general health before they can decide on the most appropriate treatment for you. \n Lumbar puncture \n In rare situations where it's thought there's a risk that AML has spread to your nervous system, a  lumbar puncture \u00a0may be carried out. In this procedure, a needle is used to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (which surrounds and protects your spine) from your back, so it can be checked for cancerous cells. \n If cancerous cells are found in your nervous system, you may need to have injections of chemotherapy medication directly into your cerebrospinal fluid as part of your treatment."},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Children", "introduction": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. One-third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia, with approximately 400 new cases in the UK each year. Approximately, three out of four of these cases are acute lymphoblastic (ALL). ALL can affect children of any age but is more common in children aged 1-4 years old. \n More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past. \n It is devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming but there are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time. \n Understanding more about the cancer your child has and the treatments that may be used can often help parents to cope. We hope you find the information here helpful. Your child\u2019s specialist will give you more detailed information, and if you have any questions it is important to ask the specialist doctor or nurse who knows your child\u2019s individual situation. \n Leukaemia \n Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some bones in the body. \n Bone marrow contains: \n \n red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body \n platelets, which help the blood to clot and control bleeding \n white blood cells, which help fight infection \n \n There are two different types of white blood cells; lymphocytes and myeloid cells (including neutrophils). These white blood cells work together to fight infection. Normally, white blood cells develop, repair and reproduce themselves in an orderly and controlled way. In leukaemia, however, the process gets out of control and the cells continue to divide in the bone marrow, but do not mature. \n These immature dividing cells fill up the bone marrow and stop it from making healthy blood cells. As the leukaemia cells are not mature, they cannot work properly. This leads to an increased risk of infection. \n There are four main types of leukaemia: \n \n acute lymphoblastic (ALL) \n  acute myeloid (AML) \u00a0 \n chronic lymphocyte (CLL) \n chronic myeloid (CML) \n \n Chronic leukaemias usually affect adults and each type of leukaemia has its own characteristics and treatment. ALL is a cancer of immature lymphocytes, called lymphoblasts or blast cells. \n There are two different types of lymphocytes; T-cells and B-cells. Often, leukaemia occurs at a very early stage in the immature lymphocytes, before they have developed into either T-cells or B-cells. However, if the cells have developed this far before becoming leukaemic, the type of leukaemia may be known as T-cell or B-cell leukaemia. \n This\u00a0is about acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). \n Causes \n The exact cause of ALL is unknown. Research is going on all the time into possible causes of this disease. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as Down\u2019s syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with ALL (particularly identical twins) have a slightly increased risk of developing ALL themselves, although\u00a0this risk is still small. \n Like all cancers, ALL is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people. \n Signs and symptoms \n As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells. \n Children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood (which help blood to clot). Sometimes, children suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells. \n A child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands. \n At first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear. \n How ALL is diagnosed \n A blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of the abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. A sample is also sent to the genetics department to look for any abnormal chromosomes, and for a test called MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis. \n A test called a lumbar puncture is done to see if the spinal fluid contains any leukaemia cells. A chest x-ray is also done, which will show if there are any enlarged glands in the chest. Other tests may be necessary, depending on your child\u2019s symptoms. \n These tests will help to identify the precise type of leukaemia and help doctors decide on the best treatment. \n Treatment \n The aim of treatment for ALL is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ALL and is given according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen). \n The treatment is given in several phases, or \u2018blocks\u2019, which are explained below. \n  Induction  \n This phase involves intensive treatment, aimed at destroying as many leukaemia cells as possible and is usually started within days of being diagnosed. The induction phase lasts 4-6 weeks. A bone marrow test is taken at the end of induction treatment to confirm whether or not the child still has leukaemia. The sample that is taken is looked at under a microscope and when there is no evidence of leukaemia, the child\u2019s condition is referred to as being in \u2018remission\u2019. \n  Consolidation and central nervous system (CNS) treatment  \n The next phase of treatment is aimed at maintaining the remission and preventing the spread of leukaemia cells into the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system, or CNS). CNS treatment involves injecting a drug, usually methotrexate lumbar puncture. \n After this consolidation treatment there is a recovery period which is called interim maintenance. This is when more drugs will be given to try to keep the leukaemia in remission. The exact details will depend on which arm of treatment your child follows and will be discussed in detail by your child\u2019s doctor as it depends on your child\u2019s response to treatment so far. \n Further doses of chemotherapy treatment, called \u2018delayed intensification\u2019, are given to kill off any remaining leukaemia cells. \n  Maintenance treatment  \n This phase of treatment lasts for two years from the start of interim maintenance for girls and three years from the start of interim maintenance for boys. It involves the child taking daily and weekly tablets, some children also have monthly injections of chemotherapy and oral pulses of steroids and three-monthly intrathecal treatment. \n Children will be able to take part in their normal daily activities as soon as they feel able to. Most children return to school before beginning maintenance treatment. \n  Bone marrow transplantation  \n Bone marrow treatment is only needed by a minority of patients and is used for children with ALL that is likely to come back following standard chemotherapy. \n  Testicular radiotherapy  \n In some situations it may be necessary for boys to have radiotherapy to their testicles. This is because leukaemia cells can survive in the testicles despite chemotherapy. \n  Central nervous system (CNS) radiotherapy  \n Children who have leukaemia cells in their CNS when they are first diagnosed with ALL need more frequent lumbar punctures with intrathecal chemotherapy. Your child\u2019s specialist will discuss with you which treatment and how much of it your child needs, and will answer any questions you have. \n Side effects of treatment \n Many cancer treatments will cause  side effects . This is because while the treatments are killing the cancer cells, they can also damage some normal cells. \n Some of the main side effects of chemotherapy are: \n \n  hair loss  \n reduction in the number of blood cells produced by the bone marrow, which can cause anaemia (an increased risk of bruising, bleeding and infection \n loss of appetite \n feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) \n \n Steroid medicines can also cause side effects such as: \n \n increased appetite \n mood changes and irritability \n weight gain \n muscle weakness (especially in the legs) \n \n Most side effects are temporary, and there are ways of reducing them and supporting your child through them. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible side effects. It is important to discuss any side effects your child is having with the team treating them, so that they know how your child is feeling. \n  Late side effects of treatment  \n A small number of children may develop late side effects, sometimes many years later. These include possible problems with puberty and fertility, a change in the way their heart works and a small increase in the risk of developing another cancer later in life. Your child\u2019s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible late side effects. \n Clinical trials \n Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for ALL. \n If appropriate, your child\u2019s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things. \n Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you\u2019ll be given enough time to decide if it is right for your child. \n Treatment guidelines \n Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the condition is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the UK. The\u00a0 Children\u2019s Cancer and Leukaemia Group \u00a0(CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines. \n Follow-up care \n Most children with ALL are cured. If the leukaemia recurs after initial treatment, it usually does so within the first three years. Further treatment can then be given. \n Long-term side effects (late side effects) are rare, and most children with ALL grow and develop normally. \n If you have specific concerns about your child\u2019s condition and treatment, it\u2019s best to discuss them with your child\u2019s doctor, who knows the situation in detail. \n Your feelings \n As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It\u2019s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet  Children &amp; Young People\u2019s Cancer; A Parent\u2019s Guide  talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support. \n Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience of cancer. The Parent\u2019s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child.", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},
{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Acute cholecystitis", "introduction": "Acute cholecystitis is swelling (inflammation) of the gallbladder. It is a potentially serious condition that usually needs to be treated in hospital. \n The\u00a0main symptom\u00a0of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right side of your tummy (abdomen) that spreads towards your right shoulder. \n The affected part of the abdomen is usually extremely tender, and breathing deeply can make the pain worse. \n Unlike some others types of  abdominal pain , the pain associated with acute cholecystitis is usually persistent, and doesn't go away within a few hours. \n Some people may additional symptoms, such as: \n \n a high temperature (fever) \n nausea and vomiting \n sweating \n loss of appetite \n yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) \n a bulge in the abdomen \n \n When to seek medical advice \n You should see your GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if the pain lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a fever. \n If it's not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local  out-of-hours service  or call the NHS 24 111 service for advice. \n It's important for acute cholecystitis to be diagnosed as soon as possible, because there is a risk that serious complications could develop if the condition is not treated promptly\u00a0(see below).\u00a0\u00a0 \n What causes acute cholecystitis? \n The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2\u00a0main categories: calculous cholecystitis and acalculous cholecystitis. \n Calculous cholecystitis \n Calculous cholecystitis is the most common, and usually less serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It accounts for around 95% of all cases. \n Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a  gallstone  or by a substance known as biliary sludge. \n Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile (a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats) and small crystals of cholesterol and salt. \n The blockage in the cystic duct results in a build-up of bile in the gallbladder, increasing the\u00a0pressure inside it and causing it to\u00a0become inflamed. In around 1\u00a0in every 5\u00a0cases, the inflamed gallbladder also becomes infected by bacteria. \n Acalculous cholecystitis \n Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It\u00a0usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder. \n Acalculous cholecystitis is often associated with problems such as accidental damage to the gallbladder during major surgery, serious injuries or  burns ,  blood poisoning (sepsis) , severe  malnutrition \u00a0or  AIDS . \n Who is affected \n Acute cholecystitis is a relatively common complication of gallstones. \n It is estimated that around 10-15% of adults in the UK have gallstones. These\u00a0don't usually cause any symptoms, but in a small proportion of people they can cause\u00a0infrequent episodes of pain (known as biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis. \n Diagnosing cholecystitis \n To diagnose acute cholecystitis, your GP will examine your abdomen. \n They will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy\u2019s sign. You will\u00a0be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage. \n Your gallbladder will move downwards as your breathe in and, if you have cholecystitis, you will experience sudden pain as your gallbladder reaches your doctor\u2019s hand. \n If your symptoms suggest you have acute cholecystitis, your GP\u00a0will refer you to hospital immediately for further tests and treatment. \n Tests you may have in hospital include: \n \n  blood tests \u00a0to check for signs of inflammation in your body \n an\u00a0 ultrasound scan  of your abdomen to check for gallstones or other signs of a problem with your gallbladder \n \n Other scans \u2013 such as an  X-ray , a\u00a0 computerised tomography (CT) scan  or a\u00a0 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan  \u2013 may also be carried out to examine your gallbladder in more detail if there is any uncertainty about your diagnosis. \n Treating acute cholecystitis \n If you are diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you will probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. \n Initial treatment \n Initial treatment will usually involve: \n \n fasting (not eating or drinking) to take the strain off your gallbladder \n receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent  dehydration  \n taking medication to relieve your pain \n \n If you have a suspected infection, you will also be given  antibiotics . These\u00a0often need to be continued for up to a week, during which time you may need to stay in hospital or you may be able to go home. \n With this initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused the\u00a0condition\u00a0usually fall back into the gallbladder and the inflammation\u00a0often settles down. \n Surgery \n In order to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring, and reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications, the removal of your gallbladder will often be recommended at some point\u00a0after the initial treatment.\u00a0This type of surgery\u00a0is known as a  cholecystectomy . \n Although uncommon, an alternative procedure called a percutaneous cholecystostomy may be carried out if you are too unwell to have surgery. This is where a needle is inserted through your abdomen to drain away the fluid that has built up in the gallbladder. \n If you are fit enough to have surgery, your doctors will\u00a0need to decide when the best time to remove your gallbladder may be. In some cases, you may need to have surgery immediately or in the next day or 2, while in other cases you may be advised to\u00a0wait for the inflammation to fully resolve over the next few weeks. \n Surgery can be carried out in two main ways: \n \n  laparoscopic cholecystectomy  \u2013 a type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed using special surgical instruments inserted through a number of small cuts (incisions) in your abdomen \n  open\u00a0cholecystectomy  \u2013 where the gallbladder is removed through a single, larger incision in your abdomen \n \n Although some people who have had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and  diarrhoea  after eating certain foods, you\u00a0can lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder. \n The organ can be useful but it's not essential, as your liver will still produce bile to digest food. \n Possible complications \n Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. \n The main complications of acute cholecystitis are: \n \n the death of the tissue of the gallbladder, called gangrenous cholecystitis, which can cause a serious infection that could spread throughout the body \n the gallbladder splitting open, known as a perforated gallbladder, which can spread the infection within your abdomen (peritonitis) or lead to a build-up of pus (abscess) \n \n In about 1\u00a0in every 5\u00a0cases of acute cholecystitis, emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications. \n Preventing acute cholecystitis \n It's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by cutting your risk of gallstones. \n One of the main steps you can take to help lower your chances of developing gallstones is\u00a0adopting a\u00a0healthy, balanced diet and reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones. \n Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. You should therefore control your weight by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. \n However, low-calorie, rapid weight loss diets should be avoided, because there is evidence they can disrupt your bile chemistry and actually increase your risk of developing gallstones. A more gradual weight loss plan is best.\u00a0 \n Read more about  preventing gallstones .", "symptoms": "", "causes": "", "treatment": "", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": ""},

The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute myeloid leukaemia. \n If you\u2019re looking for information about ALL in people of all ages, please see our general\u00a0 ALL  section. \n Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. In leukaemia, the process for making new white blood cells gets out of control.\u00a0Immature white blood cells (called blasts) keep being made and build up in the bone marrow until there isn\u2019t enough room for the bone marrow to make healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The body needs these cells to: \n \n help us fight infection (white cells)\u00a0 \n carry oxygen from the lungs around our body (red blood cells)\u00a0 \n stop us bleeding when we cut ourselves by clotting our blood (platelets) \n \n Symptoms \n Many of the symptoms of ALL are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include: \n \n looking paler than usual and feeling tired - because of too few red blood cells (anaemia) \n bruises - you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal \n infections - because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection \n aches and pains in your bones \n swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin \n feeling unwell and run down \n fever and sweats - you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection \n headaches and visual disturbance \n \n There can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. But if you are worried that you may have ALL, you should see your family doctor (GP). They will examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor. \n Causes \n We don't know exactly what causes ALL, but research is going on to try to find out. \n Young people with some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing ALL. A genetic condition is something you are born with. \n If you're worried about ALL\u00a0 \n If you think you have some of the symptoms of ALL you should go to your GP.

{"disease_type": "Common Disease", "name": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia", "introduction": "Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment. \n Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected by cancer. There are two main types: \n \n lymphocytes, which are mostly used to fight viral infections \n neutrophils, which perform several functions, such as fighting bacterial infections, defending the body against parasites and preventing the spread of tissue damage\u00a0 \n \n These pages focus on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is cancer of the lymphocytes. The following other types of leukaemia are covered elsewhere: \n \n  chronic lymphocytic leukaemia  \n  chronic myeloid leukaemia  \n  acute myeloid leukaemia  \n \n Warning signs of acute leukaemia \n Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\u00a0usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases (see below for an explanation of this). Symptoms\u00a0include: \n \n pale skin \n tiredness \n breathlessness \n having repeated infections over a short space of time \n unusual and frequent bleeding \n \n Read more about the  symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \n What happens in acute leukaemia \n All of the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow \u2013 a spongy material found inside bones. \n Bone marrow produces specialised cells called stem cells which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells: \n \n red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body \n white blood cells, which help fight infection \n platelets, which help stop bleeding \n \n Usually the bone marrow produces stem cells which are allowed to fully develop before being released into the blood. But in acute leukaemia, bone marrow starts releasing large numbers of immature white blood cells known as blast cells. \n As the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. This drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding. \n Also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. \n Around 8,600 people are diagnosed with leukaemia each year in the UK. In 2011, 654 people were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. \n Despite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children. Approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it. About 85% of cases occur in children aged under 15, mostly between the ages of two and five years old. \n The cause or causes of acute leukaemia are uncertain, but known risk factors include: \n \n exposure to high levels of radiation \n exposure to benzene, a chemical used in manufacturing that is also found in cigarettes \n \n Read more information about the  causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \n Outlook \n The outlook for children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is usually good. Almost all children will achieve a remission (a period of time where they are free from symptoms) from their symptoms, and 85% will be completely cured. \n The outlook for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is less promising as only 40% of people with the condition will be completely cured. \n Treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually involve a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In some cases, a  bone marrow transplant  may also be needed to achieve a cure. \n Read more about the  treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  \n If a cure is not possible, there is a risk that the lack of healthy blood cells can make the person extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections (due to the lack of white blood cells) or uncontrolled and serious bleeding (due to the lack of platelets).", "symptoms": "Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases. \n Most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply. \n Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include: \n \n pale skin \n feeling tired and breathless \n having repeated infections over a short space of time \n unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds \n high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above \n night sweats \n bone and joint pain \n easily bruised skin \n swollen lymph nodes (glands) \n abdominal pain \u2013 caused by a swollen liver or spleen \n unexplained weight loss\u00a0 \n a purple skin rash (purpura) \n \n In some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including: \n \n headaches \n seizures (fits) \n vomiting \n blurred vision \n dizziness \n \n When to seek medical advice \n If you or your child has some or even all of the symptoms listed above, it is still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause. \n However, see your GP as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs to be promptly investigated and treated.", "causes": "Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is caused by a DNA mutation in the stem cells causing too many white blood cells to be produced. \n The white blood cells\u00a0are also released from the bone marrow before they are mature\u00a0and able to fight infection like fully developed white blood cells. \n As the number of immature cells increases,\u00a0the number of\u00a0healthy red blood cells and platelets fall, and it's this\u00a0fall\u00a0which causes many of the\u00a0symptoms of leukaemia. \n It is not known exactly what causes this DNA mutation to occur, but there are\u00a0a few\u00a0factors which may increase the\u00a0risk of\u00a0developing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. \n Risk factors \n Genetic disorders \n A small number\u00a0of childhood acute lymphoblastic\u00a0leukaemia cases are thought to be caused by related genetic disorders. For example, rates of leukaemia tend to be higher in children with  Down\u2019s syndrome . \n Radiation exposure \n Exposure to very high levels of radiation, either before birth or afterwards, is a known risk factor. However, it would require a significant level of radiation, such as the amount released during the nuclear reactor accident at Chernobyl. \n Due to the potential risk of radiation to unborn babies, medical techniques and equipment that use radiation, such as  X-rays , are rarely used on pregnant women. \n Most cases of childhood leukaemia occur in children with no history of genetic disorders or exposure to radiation. \n Possible environmental factors \n Experts have also carried out extensive research to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia: \n \n living near a nuclear power station \n living near a power line \n living near a building or facility that releases electro-magnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mast \n \n At the moment there is no evidence to confirm that any of these environmental factors increases the risk of developing leukaemia. \n Benzene \n Exposure to the chemical benzene is a known risk factor for adult acute leukaemia. Benzene is found in petrol and is also used in the rubber industry. However, there are strict controls to protect people from prolonged exposure. \n Benzene is also found in cigarettes, which could explain why smokers are three times more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers. People who have had  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy  to treat earlier, unrelated cancers also have an increased risk of developing acute leukaemia. \n Other risk factors \n There is some evidence to show an increased risk of\u00a0acute lymphoblastic\u00a0leukaemia in people who: \n \n are  obese  \n have a weakened immune system \u2013 due to  HIV or AIDS  or taking immunosuppressants after an organ transplant", "treatment": "Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begins a few days after diagnosis as it's an aggressive condition that develops rapidly. \n Stages of treatment \n Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is carried out in stages: \n \n induction \u2013 the aim of the initial stage of treatment is to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood\u00a0and resolve any symptoms you may have \n consolidation \u2013 this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemia cells in your central nervous system \n maintenance \u2013 the final stage involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets to prevent the leukaemia returning \n \n Maintenance only seems to be effective in treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; it's not usually used in the treatment of  acute myeloid leukaemia . \n Induction \n The induction stage of treatment is carried out in hospital or in a specialist centre. This is because you will probably need to have regular\u00a0 blood transfusions  as it's likely that your blood will not contain enough healthy blood cells. \n You will also be vulnerable to infection, so it is important that you are in a sterile environment where your health can be carefully monitored and any infection that you have can be promptly treated. You may also be prescribed\u00a0 antibiotics  to help prevent further infection. \n Chemotherapy \n You will be given\u00a0 chemotherapy  to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow. Although some medications may be given as pills, you will need more than one medication given as an injection. To make things easier and avoid repeated injections, they can all be given via one flexible tube\u00a0into a vein in your chest (called a central line). \n Some chemotherapy medication may also be directly administered into your cerebrospinal fluid to kill any leukaemia cells that may have spread to your nervous system. This\u00a0is given using a needle that is placed into your spine, in a similar way to a\u00a0 lumbar puncture . \n Side effects that occur following chemotherapy are common. They can include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n diarrhoea \n loss of appetite \n mouth ulcers \n tiredness \n skin rashes \n infertility \n hair loss \n \n The side effects should resolve once treatment has finished. Your hair will usually take between three to six months to grow back. \n Steroid therapy \n You may also be given\u00a0 corticosteroid  injections or tablets to help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy. \n Imatinib \n If you have a type of leukaemia known as Philadelphia chromosome-positive\u00a0acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, you will also be given a medicine called imatinib. Imatinib works by blocking the signals in the cancerous cells that cause them to grow and reproduce. This kills the cancerous cells. \n Imatinib is taken orally (as a tablet). The side effects of imatinib are usually mild and should improve over time. They include: \n \n nausea \n vomiting \n swelling in the face and lower legs \n muscle cramps \n rash \n diarrhoea \n \n Depending on how well you respond to treatment, the induction phase can last from two weeks to several months. In some cases, you or your child may be able to leave hospital and receive treatment on an outpatient basis if your symptoms improve. \n Consolidation \n Leukaemia can return if just one cancerous cell remains in your body. Therefore the aim of consolidation treatment is to ensure that any remaining leukaemia cells are killed. \n Treatment involves receiving regular injections of chemotherapy medication. This is usually done on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. However, you may require some short stays in hospital if your symptoms suddenly get worse or if you develop an infection. \n The consolidation phase of treatment lasts several months. \n Maintenance \n The maintenance phase is designed to act as further insurance against the possibility of the leukaemia returning. It involves taking regular doses of chemotherapy tablets while undergoing regular check-ups to monitor how effective your treatment is proving. \n The maintenance phase can often last for two years. \n Other treatments \n As well as chemotherapy and imatinib, other treatments are used in some circumstances. These are described below.\u00a0 \n Dasatinib \n Dasatinib is a new type of medication used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, when all other treatments have proved unsuccessful. \n Dasatinib blocks a protein called tyrosine kinase that helps stimulate the growth of cancer cells. \n Dasatinib cannot cure acute leukaemia but it can slow its growth, helping to relieve symptoms and prolong life. \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has not yet made a decision about whether the NHS should provide treatment with dasatinib for people with acute lymphoblastic\u00a0leukaemia. This means it will be at the discretion of your local\u00a0clinical commissioning group\u00a0as to whether you will be offered the drug. \n Radiotherapy \n  Radiotherapy \u00a0involves using high doses of controlled radiation to kill cancerous cells. There are two main reasons why radiotherapy is usually used to treat acute leukaemia: \n \n to sometimes treat advanced cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia that have spread to the nervous system or brain \n to prepare the body for a bone marrow transplant (see below) \n \n Side effects of both types of radiotherapy include: \n \n hair loss \n nausea \n fatigue \n \n The side effects should pass once your course of radiotherapy has been completed. However, your skin may be very sensitive to the effects of light for several months after the treatment has finished. If this is the case, avoid sunbathing or exposure to sources of artificial light, such as sunbeds, for several months. \n Many younger children treated with radiotherapy will go on to have restricted physical growth during puberty. \n A small number of people develop cataracts several years after radiotherapy. Cataracts are cloudy patches in the lens (the transparent structure at the front of the eye) that can make your vision blurred or misty. Cataracts can usually be successfully treated using surgery. \n Read more about  cataracts  and  cataract surgery  \n Bone marrow and stem cell transplants \n If you or your child do not respond to chemotherapy, a possible alternative treatment option is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. \n Transplantations are more successful if the donor has the same tissue type as you, so the ideal donor is usually a brother or sister. \n Before transplantation can take place, the person receiving the transplant will need to have aggressive high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy to destroy any cancerous cells in their body. \n This can put a big\u00a0strain on the body\u00a0so transplantations are usually only successful when they are carried out in children and young people, or older people who are in good health, and when there is a suitable donor, such as a brother or sister. \n Read\u00a0about  bone marrow transplantation  for more information", "affected_populations": "", "diagnosis": "The first step in diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is for your GP to check for physical signs of the condition, such as swollen glands, and to take a blood sample. \n A high number of abnormal white blood cells in the blood sample could indicate the presence of acute leukaemia and you will then be referred to a haematologist (a specialist in treating blood conditions). \n Bone marrow biopsy \n To confirm a diagnosis of acute leukaemia, the haematologist will take a small sample of your bone marrow to examine under a microscope. \n The haematologist will use a  local anaesthetic  to numb the skin over a bone \u2013 usually the hip bone \u2013 and then use a needle to remove a sample of bone marrow. You may experience some pain once the anaesthetic wears off and some bruising and discomfort for a few days afterwards. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete and you shouldn't have to stay in hospital overnight. \n The bone marrow will be checked for cancerous cells and \u2013 if found \u2013 the type of acute leaukaemia will be determined at the same time. \n Further tests \n There are various additional tests that can be used to help reveal more information about the progress and extent of the leukaemia. They can also provide an insight into how the leukaemia should be treated. These tests are described below. \n Cytogenetic testing \n Cytogenetic testing involves identifying the genetic make-up of the cancerous cells. There are specific genetic variations that can occur during leukaemia, and knowing what these variations are can have an important impact on treatment. \n Immunophenotyping \n Immunophenotyping is a test to help identify the exact type of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A sample of blood, bone marrow or another type of fluid is studied. \n This testing is important as the treatment needed may be slightly different for each type. \n Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) \n A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be done on a blood sample. This is an important test to diagnose and monitor the response to treatment. \n The blood test is repeated every three months for at least two years after starting treatment, then less often once remission is achieved. \n Lymph node biopsy \n If you have been diagnosed with acute leukaemia, further biopsies may be carried out on any enlarged lymph nodes that you have. These will be able to establish how far the leukaemia has spread. \n CT scans \n If you have acute leukaemia, a computerised tomography scan ( CT scan ) may be used to check that your organs, such as your heart and lungs, are healthy. \n Chest X-ray \n An\u00a0 X-ray  may be performed to examine the chest for any swollen lymph nodes. \n Lumbar puncture \n If it is felt that there is a risk that acute leukaemia has spread to your nervous system, a  lumbar puncture  may be carried out. \n A lumbar puncture is a test where a needle is used under local anaesthetic to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds and protects your spine) from your back. The fluid is tested to determine whether leukaemia has reached your nervous system."}
